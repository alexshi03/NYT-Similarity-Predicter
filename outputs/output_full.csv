Carl Hulse,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Gets a Slow Start on Judges After Setting a Record Pace in First Term,"After an aggressive drive to reshape the federal judiciary during his first stint in
the White House, President Trump is moving more slowly so far this time, waiting
more than three months into his second term to announce his first judicial nominee
this week.
In a social media post late Thursday, the president said he had chosen Whitney
Hermandorfer, a lawyer in the Tennessee attorney general’s office, for a vacant
seat on the Cincinnati-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. He called
the former Supreme Court clerk “a Fighter who will inspire confidence in our Legal
System.”
The president starts his second term with far less opportunity to install judicial
picks than he did eight years ago, when he was handed more than 100 vacancies
after Senate Republicans stalled President Barack Obama’s court picks during the
last two years of his term. Currently, there are just over 40 federal court vacancies
after the Democratic-controlled Senate pushed to fill as many seats as possible
before President Joseph R. Biden Jr. left office.
Senators said they believed more Trump nominations were imminent and have
encouraged the White House to pick up the pace.
“I’ve been urging them to get a move on,” said Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri
Republican and member of the Judiciary Committee. “I've said to them over and
over again, ‘We’ve had a lot of vacancies in Missouri for a long time now and we
really need to fill them.’ ”
By this point in Mr. Trump’s first term in 2017, the Senate had already confirmed a
new Supreme Court justice, Mr. Trump had nominated an appeals court judge and
several other prominent judicial nominees were in the queue to be announced
within days after he made placing conservatives on the federal courts a
centerpiece of his first campaign. By the end of his first presidency, Mr. Trump had
named two other Supreme Court justices and the Republican-controlled Senate had
confirmed a total of 234 federal judges.
This time, after Mr. Biden and his Democratic allies in the Senate topped Mr.
Trump’s record on judges with 235 confirmed, the incoming administration has
only three openings on the appellate courts and 43 in the trial-level district courts.
Despite the slow start, Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who
chairs the Judiciary Committee and will oversee judicial confirmations, said that he
“was not worried from the standpoint that there’s less vacancies than there were
eight years ago.”
The administration also has prioritized filling executive branch posts and
ambassadorships rather than lifetime judicial appointments.
“They’ve just been absolutely determined to get the cabinet done and obviously
make progress with the big beautiful bill,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of
Texas and another member of the Judiciary Committee, referring to still-
developing tax and spending cut legislation. “They’ve got a lot of litigation. And
then they’ve made a priority for some of the ambassadors, which I don’t have any
quibble with.”
In comparison to Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden, who chaired the Judiciary Committee as a
senator, made his first judicial nominations in mid-April of 2021, naming 10
candidates. Mr. Obama, who was consumed by the financial crisis in 2009, his first
year in office, and was seen by some as moving too slowly on judges himself,
nominated his first judge in mid-March.
During his first run for president, Mr. Trump campaigned relentlessly on his pledge
to populate the courts with conservative jurists as he tried to cement his support
among social conservatives who were leery of his candidacy but also historically
cast their ballots with more attention to the consequences for the Supreme Court
and the judiciary.
After Mr. Trump’s election, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and
the majority leader, and Donald F. McGahn II, then his White House counsel,
agreed to focus the Senate on installing as many judges with conservative
credentials as possible. The judicial push became an overarching theme of Mr.
Trump’s tenure.
Mr. McGahn, now in private practice, called Ms. Hermandorfer a “stellar” pick and
said he was confident Mr. Trump would have second-term judicial success as well.
“President Trump is off to a strong start and it looks like he is picking up where he
left off,” Mr. McGahn said.
If confirmed, Ms. Hermandorfer, a Princeton graduate who was a co-captain of the
university’s women’s basketball team, would replace an Obama administration
appointee on the conservative-leaning appeals court.
As director of the strategic litigation unit in the Tennessee attorney general’s office,
she has argued high-profile cases, including defending the state’s abortion ban and
challenging a Biden administration prohibition on discrimination against
transgender students. Ms. Hermandorfer clerked for Justices Samuel A. Alito and
Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court and for Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh
when he sat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
“She has a long history of working for Judges and Justices who respect the RULE
OF LAW, and protect our Constitution,” Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.
Lawmakers said they expected the Trump administration to focus first on judicial
vacancies in states represented by Republican senators, avoiding fights with
Democrats who retain the power to block district court nominees for their states
under the committee’s “blue slip” tradition. More openings also exist in those states
after Republican senators balked at allowing the Biden administration to fill seats
there.
Conservative activists also hope that a strong showing by the White House in
naming conservative nominees could convince veteran federal judges named by
previous Republican presidents to step aside and allow Mr. Trump to fill their slots
with younger replacements who can spend decades more on the bench.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-judges-nominations.html
Qasim Nauman,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Signs Executive Order to End Federal Funding for NPR and PBS,"President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aiming to cut federal
funding for NPR and PBS, accusing the news outlets of producing biased coverage
and “left-wing propaganda.”
Mr. Trump instructed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds public
broadcasters in the United States, to end federal funding for NPR and PBS, to the
extent allowed by law. The outlets receive only a small portion of their funding
from Congress, with the rest coming from donors and sponsors.
The immediate impact of the order was unclear. The Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, a taxpayer-backed, private entity created by an act of Congress, is
funded two years in advance to protect it from political maneuvering.
“CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President’s authority,”
Patricia Harrison, the president and chief executive of the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, said in a statement on Friday. “Congress directly authorized and
funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal
government.”
Trump Signs Executive Order Seeking to End
Federal Funding for NPR and PBS
The executive order was the latest move by the Trump administration against what
it described as biased public media. The White House released a document
accompanying the order on its website, criticizing the two broadcasters’ coverage
of, among other topics, the Covid-19 pandemic and Hunter Biden, the son of former
President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Mr. Trump ordered the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and all federal
agencies to also cut indirect funding by forbidding public radio and television
broadcasters that receive federal funds from using that money for PBS or NPR
programs.
The chief executives of NPR and PBS testified before Congress in March, a heated
hearing in which Republicans assailed them for what they described as liberal bias.
The White House wants Congress to take back more than $1 billion for two years
that has been allocated for the Corporation of Public Broadcasting. Mr. Trump’s
order on Thursday instructed the board of the corporation to “cancel existing direct
funding to the maximum extent allowed by law” and “decline to provide future
funding.”
Mr. Trump’s executive order is “blatantly unlawful,” Paula Kerger, the president
and chief executive of PBS, said in a statement on Friday. “We are currently
exploring all options to allow PBS to continue to serve our member stations and all
Americans,” she added.
NPR said in a statement earlier on Friday that its editorial practices and decisions
are independent and free from outside influences, including political parties.
“Eliminating funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would have a
devastating impact on American communities across the nation that rely on public
radio for trusted local and national news, culture, lifesaving emergency alerts and
public safety information,” the statement said.
Ms. Kerger, the PBS chief executive, said in an interview that aired this week that
about 15 percent of the overall budget for public broadcasters comes from the
federal government.
“This is different than many other public broadcasters around the world, which are
largely state-supported,” she said on “PBS NewsHour.” “We are not.”
Nevertheless, in 2011 NPR assembled a 36-page document that detailed what
would happen if the Treasury stopped cutting checks to the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting. The document describes a precarious radio system that would bear
the blow poorly, with consequences for listeners across the United States.
Independent member stations get most of the money dedicated to public radio.
That makes them more vulnerable than NPR, which says it gets only 1 percent of
its budget from Congress.
Public television in the United States would likely be in worse shape because PBS
receives much more of its budget — about 15 percent of $373 million — from the
federal government.
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting sued the Trump administration this week,
accusing it of illegally trying to fire three members of its board. The administration
had not offered any justification for the dismissals.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-funding-npr-pbs.html
Qasim Nauman,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Says He Is Renaming Veterans Day ‘Victory Day for World War I’,"President Trump said Thursday that he would rename Veterans Day, on Nov. 11, as
“Victory Day for World War I” and May 8, widely known as V-E Day, as “Victory
Day for World War II,” so that the United States could celebrate its achievements in
those conflicts.
“We won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or
military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything,” Mr. Trump said in a late-night
post on Truth Social. “We are going to start celebrating our victories again!”
The announcement was not accompanied by an executive order, and Mr. Trump did
not say whether he intended for May 8 to be a federal holiday, like Veterans Day.
The power to create and amend public holidays rests with Congress.
Mr. Trump referenced the celebrations by America’s allies to mark V-E Day, for
“Victory in Europe,” this year. “We did more than any other” country, he said, to
achieve an Allied victory in World War II, a conflict that devastated most of Europe
and huge parts of Asia.
The V-E Day commemorations this year in Britain, France, Canada and other U.S.
allies will mark 80 years since the formal end of the war in Europe after Germany’s
surrender.
Mr. Trump’s claim that the United States did more than any other nation to defeat
Nazi Germany might be contested in Russia, which marks the Soviet victory over
German forces in World War II on May 9 every year. The Russian Victory Day,
which is meant to honor the 27 million Soviets who died in the war, is a national
holiday and one of the most important days on the country’s calendar.
Veterans Day was originally called Armistice Day in the United States to mark the
end of World War I. After World War II and the Korean War, it was renamed, and its
scope was expanded to honor all U.S. military veterans. Memorial Day, which falls
on the last Monday in May, specifically honors those who gave their lives for the
country.
In his post on Thursday night, Mr. Trump did not detail any specific celebrations he
wanted to see on these two days. He has previously expressed his desire to honor
the military with events such as parades in Washington.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-veterans-day-world-war-i.html
Eric Lipton,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Elon Musk’s SpaceX Could Make Billions If Trump’s Budget Proposal Is Approved,"Elon Musk and SpaceX are big winners in Donald J. Trump’s 2026 spending plan.
President Trump is delivering on Mr. Musk’s wish list at both NASA and the
Pentagon to reorient federal spending on space in a way likely to drive billions of
dollars in new business to Mr. Musk’s space technology company, if Congress signs
off on the budget plan.
At the Pentagon, Mr. Trump is calling for a massive jump in spending, an
extraordinary 13 percent increase, almost entirely through allocations in a
Congressional budget reconciliation plan under consideration.
The jump would happen while many other federal agencies would be slashed, in
part to supercharge federal spending in two areas where SpaceX is positioned to
profit: a vast missile defense system and space missions to Mars and the moon.
Trump’s Space Budget Reflects Influence of Elon
Musk and SpaceX
Mr. Trump has proposed a Golden Dome defense system to track and kill missiles
headed toward U.S. targets, possibly sent by China, Russia, North Korea or other
rivals.
Pentagon officials say SpaceX is considered likely to be the top recipient of this
burst of new spending, which could generate billions of dollars in new contracts for
the company.
That is because SpaceX manufactures both rockets that can launch military
payloads into orbit and satellite systems that can deliver the surveillance and
targeting tools needed for the project, which would require the largest military
investments the United States has ever made in space.
Mr. Trump’s budget plan also calls for an undisclosed but large amount of new
money for “U.S. space dominance to strengthen U.S. national security.”
The giant load of expected new business for SpaceX, which already had started to
become clear based on policy shifts Mr. Trump has made since January, has drawn
questions from Democrats in Washington, who have questioned if Mr. Musk is
cashing in on his enormous contributions toward Mr. Trump’s re-election and his
position as a top White House adviser.
SpaceX is already, by far, the largest recipient of Pentagon spending on existing
military low-earth-orbit communications systems, and it gets the largest cut of
Pentagon rocket launch contracts. Congressional approval for the plan to
significantly expand this spending would be a giant win for Mr. Musk and SpaceX.
Mr. Trump’s proposed budget calls for Pentagon spending for 2026 to be $113 billion
greater than for this year. But that increase would come entirely from allocations
Congress is considering via its reconciliation plan for the 2025 fiscal year,
according to Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute
and a former space industry executive, who pointed to a footnote in Mr. Trump’s
plan.
NASA’s budget faces overall cuts in Mr. Trump’s plan, but there are increases that
largely match SpaceX’s own corporation priorities.
The spending plan goes after Mr. Musk’s commercial rivals, calling for NASA to
phase out funding for the Space Launch System, a rocket program being led by
Boeing, and also the Orion astronaut capsule, being built by Lockheed Martin,
which was part of three planned flights to take humans back to the moon.
Instead, Mr. Trump’s budget calls for “more cost effective commercial systems that
would support more ambitious subsequent lunar missions,” an industry that
SpaceX now dominates. Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, which has developed its own new
rocket, also could be a big beneficiary of this shift, industry executives said Friday.
Both Blue Origin and SpaceX have moon landing systems that NASA is contracted
to use and that have not, at least so far, been targeted for cuts.
“Their design is easier to do than SpaceX,” said Doug Loverro, a former NASA
associate administrator for human exploration and operations who has also been
an adviser to the Trump administration, referring to Blue Origin’s moon landing
plan.
The NASA budget also calls for $1 billion in new spending to focus on a mission to
Mars, which has been the primary driving force for Mr. Musk since he first started
SpaceX. He is already building a new rocket, called Starship, to attempt to deliver
on this plan.
“SpaceX’s handprints are all over this,” said Mo Islam, a co-founder of Payload, a
commercial space news site. “I don’t see there is any other way to look at it.
SpaceX is positioned to be the primary beneficiary of the majority of these
budgetary moves.”
There are some items in the NASA budget that could result in declines in spending
at SpaceX, such as less spending on the International Space Station, where SpaceX
delivers both cargo and astronauts.
But SpaceX still will likely emerge the winner. It recently won an $843 million
contract to “de-orbit” the space station when it is retired in 2030. And Mr. Musk has
pushed Mr. Trump to speed up that retirement date.
“The decision is up to the President, but my recommendation is as soon as
possible,” Mr. Musk wrote on his social media platform, X, in February.
In the 2024 fiscal year, SpaceX secured $3.8 billion in federal contracts, most of it
from NASA and the Pentagon. The company has taken a total of $18 billion in
federal contracts overall in the last decade, a New York Times analysis of federal
contracting data shows.
Experts like Mr. Loverro have long argued that NASA is too focused on an over-
budget and behind-schedule moon program called Artemis, particularly the parts
of the effort that rely on Boeing and Lockheed. That said, Mr. Loverro said the new
spending plan “does impact SpaceX in a lot of very positive ways.”
But Mr. Harrison, the former industry executive, said it also opens up SpaceX and
the Trump administration to potential criticism.
“It taints this now all with a suspicion of improper influence,” Mr. Harrison said.
“Even if these are legitimate questions.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/elon-musk-spacex-trump-

Charlie Savage,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Pam Bondi Rolls Back Leak Inquiry Constraint Stemming From Fox News Case,"Attorney General Pam Bondi has rolled back a constraint on leak inquiries that the
Justice Department imposed more than a decade ago, making it easier for
investigators to get around a legal bar on search warrants to seize news gathering
records.
The safeguard was imposed in 2013 after the revelation that the F.B.I. had
portrayed a Fox News reporter as a criminal to bypass restrictions on seizing
reporters’ emails.
The change was part of a revised regulation Ms. Bondi issued this week involving
leak inquiries. Most of the discussion has focused on how investigators can once
again use court orders, subpoenas and search warrants to go after reporters’
information, ending a flat ban on those tactics imposed in 2021 by Attorney General
Merrick B. Garland.
Essentially, Ms. Bondi returned to the standard in place before Mr. Garland’s
intervention. But a close reading shows that in doing so, she also deleted a key
section of the earlier regulation that had emerged from the Fox News incident. The
In Leak Crackdown, Bondi Rolls Back 2013
Protection Stemming From Fox News Case
section had limited the ability of investigators to sidestep a 1980 law that generally
bars search warrants for newsroom records.
The omission was striking because many conservatives and Republicans were
outraged by the events that led the department, under Attorney General Eric H.
Holder Jr., to make the reform. The targeted reporter at Fox News, James Rosen, is
now the chief White House correspondent for another conservative network,
Newsmax.
In a memo last week announcing the end of Mr. Garland’s ban on using compulsory
tools to go after reporters’ communications records, notes or testimony, Ms. Bondi
declared: “This Justice Department will not tolerate unauthorized disclosures that
undermine President Trump’s policies, victimize government agencies, and cause
harm to the American people.”
But her memo did not mention any intent to also eliminate the change inspired by
the Fox News incident, which remained in place under the first Trump
administration. The department press office did not respond to a request for
comment.

had portrayed Mr. Rosen’s reporting for Fox News as criminal in a search warrant
application. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
Gabe Rottman, the vice president of policy for Reporters Committee for Freedom of
the Press, warned that the deletion of the safeguard raised the possibility “that you
could see a repeat of the James Rosen case” and said it “raises significant First
Amendment concerns.” He posted an analysis of the new regulation on the group’s
blog.
“Reducing or eliminating protections from journalists and their sensitive news
gathering records impairs not just the press but the public,” Mr. Rottman added. “It
harms the public’s ability to hold the government accountable.”
The issue centers on the Privacy Protection Act of 1980, which generally bans
warrants to search for and seize news gathering materials. But the law contains an
exception for cases in which reporters themselves are criminal suspects.
In 2009, Mr. Rosen reported on North Korea’s plans for a nuclear test. The Justice
Department opened a leak investigation and eventually prosecuted a State
Department contractor, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim. (In 2014, Mr. Kim pleaded guilty to
making an unauthorized disclosure of restricted information and was sentenced to
13 months in prison.)
It was vanishingly rare in the 20th century for the Justice Department to bring
criminal charges in a leak case. But it started to become common midway through
the George W. Bush administration and under Mr. Holder’s watch, the number
continued to soar.
Then, in May 2013, it came to light that investigators had seized two months of
Associated Press phone records and that they had portrayed Mr. Rosen’s reporting
for Fox News as criminal in a search warrant application, raising the prospect of an
unprecedented prosecution of a reporter for publishing information.
In seeking a warrant to gain access to Mr. Rosen’s emails at Google, an F.B.I. agent
told a judge that “there is probable cause to believe that the reporter has
committed or is committing a violation” of the Espionage Act — which criminalizes
the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive national security information — “as an
aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator” of his source.
Critics across party lines expressed concerns that the Justice Department was
going too far in its crackdown on leaks, and some lawmakers also accused Mr.
Holder of having misled Congress in earlier testimony in which he said he opposed
that idea and had never been involved in or heard discussions about any such
potential prosecution.
Justice Department officials countered that they never actually intended to
prosecute Mr. Rosen, and had only portrayed him as a criminal suspect to invoke
the exemption to the 1980 statute. Critics said the defense essentially amounted to
an admission that the department had gamed the law in bad faith.
“That tactic circumvents the clear intent of the Privacy Protection Act,” Mr.
Rottman said. “The law is meant to ensure that government can’t seek search
warrants for a journalist’s records or unpublished stories unless it has probable
cause to believe the journalist has actually done something really wrong.”
In response to the broader furor, President Obama ordered a review of procedures
for leak investigations, saying he was “troubled” that investigative reporting could
be stifled. Mr. Holder repeatedly met with news media leaders, acknowledging
criticism that the Justice Department had tipped too far toward aggressive law
enforcement.
He developed new guidelines for leak investigations. Those included forbidding
portraying reporters as co-conspirators in criminal leaks simply to circumvent the
legal bar on secret search warrants for their reporting materials. His regulation
said investigators could only invoke the exemption to the 1980 law if a reporter was
officially under investigation.
Those rules stayed in place until early in the Biden administration, when it came to
light that under the Trump administration, the Justice Department had seized the
communications records of reporters at The New York Times, The Washington
Post and CNN.
President Biden ordered prosecutors to stop seizing reporters’ phone and email
data. Mr. Garland established a regulation barring the Justice Department from
using “compulsory legal process for the purpose of obtaining information from or
records of members of the news media acting within the scope of news gathering,
except in limited circumstances.”
Last year, the House unanimously passed a bipartisan bill to strengthen the ability
of reporters to protect confidential sources. But it died in the Senate after Mr.
Trump instructed Republicans to “kill this bill.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/justice-department-leak-inquiry-rules.html
Edward Wong,NYT,1,US,5/1/2025,Marco Rubio Adds a New Title Under Trump: Interim National Security Adviser,"Secretary of state. Acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International
Development. Acting archivist for the National Archives and Records
Administration. And now interim national security adviser to President Trump.
Like a Christmas tree bedecked with shiny ornaments of every shape and size,
Marco Rubio, 53, has accumulated four titles starting with his confirmation as
secretary of state on Jan. 20, the same day that Mr. Trump took his oath of office.
It very well could be a record in the modern history of the U.S. government. And it
adds to the immigrant success story that is core to the narrative of Mr. Rubio, a
former senator from Florida whose father worked as a bartender and mother toiled
as a housekeeper after they left Cuba for the United States.
But the proliferation of titles raises questions about whether Mr. Rubio can play
any substantial role in the administration if he is juggling all these positions,
especially under a president who eschews the traditional workings of government

and who has appointed a businessman friend, Steve Witkoff, as a special envoy
handling the most sensitive diplomacy.
Mr. Trump announced Mr. Rubio’s newest position in a social media post on
Thursday afternoon, a surprise twist in the first big personnel shake-up of this
administration. The president had just ousted Michael Waltz from the White House
national security adviser job as well as Mr. Waltz’s deputy, Alex Wong. In the same
post, Mr. Trump said Mr. Waltz would now be his nominee to be ambassador to the
United Nations.
Mr. Rubio’s appointment to yet another job — as if he were cloned in a B-grade sci-
fi movie — was so sudden that Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokeswoman,
learned about it when a reporter read Mr. Trump’s social media post to her during a
regular televised news conference.
“Yeah, so that is the miracle of modern technology and social media,” Ms. Bruce
said. “So that is an exciting moment here.”
Scrambling to try to explain the events unfolding in real time, Ms. Bruce said:
“We’ve seen him be at the White House several times a week, his close working
relationship day to day with the president. They clearly have been in an
environment where they’ve gotten to know each other very well.”
The fact that Mr. Rubio now leads four bodies is a sign not only of the trust placed
in him by Mr. Trump, but also of the close relationship he has with Susie Wiles, the
veteran political operative who is Mr. Trump’s chief of staff.
Of course, having four jobs also raises more practical issues: Does Mr. Rubio get a
pay bump? Will he have time to hop around the globe to do diplomacy? How will he
delegate his duties?
There are precedents — sort of. From 1973 to 1975, Henry Kissinger held two of Mr.
Rubio’s jobs, secretary of state and national security adviser, in an experiment that
was considered a failure. In the current Trump administration, two officials, Kash
Patel, the F.B.I. director, and Daniel Driscoll, the Army secretary, have both been
interim head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives while also
serving in their more prominent posts.
But it might be more relevant to look outside the United States for examples. Xi
Jinping, China’s leader, is general secretary of the Communist Party, president of
China and chairman of the Central Military Commission — still one job short of Mr.
Rubio’s tally when counting his top titles (Mr. Xi is also the head of several party
groups).
The Senate unanimously confirmed Mr. Rubio to be secretary of state. But he
entered the other jobs under controversial circumstances. Mr. Trump fired the
head archivist, Colleen Shogan, in early February in an apparent act of retribution
against the National Archives and Records Administration. Leaders of the agency
had raised concerns about Mr. Trump’s holding onto boxes of classified documents
at his home in Florida after he left office in 2021, though Ms. Shogan was not
involved in that episode.
Four days before Ms. Shogan’s firing, Mr. Rubio announced he was the acting
administrator for U.S.A.I.D., as Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser to Mr. Trump,
and Pete Marocco, a political appointee in the State Department, were gutting the
agency. Mr. Marocco and members of Mr. Musk’s government-slashing task force
did the daily work of reducing the agency to a husk, cutting contracts and firing
thousands of employees, but Mr. Rubio signed off on the moves.
Mr. Rubio is moving the remnants of the agency into the State Department. Last
week, he issued a chart on his planned department reorganization that shows him
keeping the title of U.S.A.I.D. administrator.
Even before Mr. Trump appointed the top U.S. diplomat/archivist/aid agency
administrator to be interim national security adviser, some analysts were pointing
out the problems with Mr. Rubio holding all these positions.
“Occupying two (or in Rubio’s case, three) roles at once is never ideal — directing
government agencies and programs is a significant task that demands attention
and focus,” said a post on the site of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in
Washington, a government watchdog group, in March. “But Rubio’s current
positions are uniquely concerning.”
The writer, Gabriella Cantor, pointed out the obvious conflict of interest: The
archivist is supposed to ensure that other federal agencies, including the two Mr.
Rubio is also leading, preserve records. Now, with the addition of the White House
National Security Council, that becomes thornier.
As for the question of Mr. Rubio’s salary (or salaries), the State Department did not
reply when asked on Thursday.
That night, Vice President JD Vance threw out an idea on social media for how Mr.
Rubio could go even further as a one-stop shop for assuming new authorities.
“I think he could take on a bit more,” Mr. Vance wrote. “If only there was a job
opening for a devout Catholic…”
Mr. Vance had visited Pope Francis in the Vatican last month just hours before the
pope died.
Mr. Rubio laughed about the suggestion in an interview on Fox News. “We thought
about it,” he said. “Any unmarried Catholic male can be pope, but I got married and
I’m happily married, so I guess I’ll miss out on that one.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/marco-rubio-national-security-secretary-state.html
Aishvarya Kavi,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Army Plans a Big Parade That Could Fall on Trump’s Birthday,"The United States Army said on Friday it is planning a parade in Washington with
thousands of soldiers and military demonstrations celebrating the 250th
anniversary of its founding on June 14, which is also President Trump’s 79th
birthday.
The parade is set to include 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft and participation from 6,600
soldiers, according to a statement from the Army. A fireworks display and a
daylong festival are also planned, including equipment displays, musical
performances and a fitness competition alongside the military demonstrations.
The Army said the celebration was in honor of its 250th birthday but did not
mention that the president’s birthday happened to be the same day.
“Given the significant milestone of 250 years,” the statement said, “the Army is
exploring options to make the celebration even bigger, with more capability
demonstrations, additional displays of equipment, and more engagement with the
community.”
It was not clear from the Army statement on Friday which events would be held on
June 14 and which would happen in the lead-up to the anniversary. The White
House last month denied that a military parade was scheduled for Mr. Trump’s
birthday. But The Associated Press reported on Thursday that it had reviewed
military planning documents that had the parade scheduled for June 14.
When asked for clarification on the schedule, a spokeswoman for the Army
responded that planning was underway and suggested the festival with the display
of military equipment would be held on the 14th.
Mr. Trump has expressed a fondness for military parades since his first term, when
he backed off his bid for a spectacle after some in his administration balked at the
cost. The lack of enthusiasm in Washington and the comparisons to authoritarian
showcases of military might have failed to douse his interest.
“We’re going to show the people as we build up our military, we’re going to display
our military,” he told a reporter ahead of his first inauguration. “That military may
come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue.”
Mr. Trump again became enthralled with the idea after witnessing the grandeur of
Bastille Day in Paris in 2017, which featured an elaborate display of tanks, soldiers
on horseback and military jets flying overhead.
His own military advisers pushed back against the idea when estimates of the
price soared close to $100 million. But Mr. Trump did not let go of the idea.
“Maybe we will do something next year in D.C. when the cost comes WAY DOWN,”
he wrote on Twitter in August of 2018. He blamed local government officials in
Washington for inflating the price “so ridiculously high” that he had to cancel the
parade.
Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, asked last month if the city had been
contacted about plans for a military parade, repeated concerns about the cost and
the potential damage to the city’s streets from heavy combat vehicles.
“If military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of
dollars to repair the roads,” Ms. Bowser said.
While many countries, from France to North Korea, use such parades to mark
milestones, displays of military might are rare in Washington.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-birthday-military-parade.html
Kenneth Chang,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump’s 2026 Budget Proposes Cutting NASA Funding by $6 Billion,"Under President Trump’s proposed budget, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration would largely become the National Moon and Mars Administration,
with an almost singular focus on getting astronauts to those two destinations.
The Trump administration proposes a budget of $18.8 billion for NASA, down 24
percent from $24.8 billion in the current budget year. The plan would introduce $1
billion in new investments for Mars, which would aim to fulfill Mr. Trump’s pledge
during his address to Congress in March to “plant a flag” on Mars.
That budgetary change also aligns with the priorities of Elon Musk, who founded
his SpaceX rocket company two decades ago with dreams of one day sending
colonists to Mars.
The budget proposal does not offer any details of how the $1 billion would be spent,
or a timeline for getting astronauts to Mars. Mr. Musk has said he will launch to
Mars the new giant Starship vehicle that SpaceX is currently developing — without
NASA Proposal Would Shift Agency’s Focus
Away From Space Science
anyone aboard — in late 2026, and presumably would look to NASA’s Mars money
to help pay for that.
“This proposal includes investments to simultaneously pursue exploration of the
Moon and Mars while still prioritizing critical science and technology research,”
Janet Petro, the acting NASA administrator, said in a statement.
Deep cuts would slash spending elsewhere at NASA, especially the agency’s
robotic space science missions. Proposed cancellations include a mission to bring
back rock samples from Mars, and climate monitoring satellites. The Space Launch
System and Orion crew capsule that will take astronauts back to the moon would
be canceled after Artemis III, the first crewed mission that would land near the
moon’s south pole. Gateway, a small space station in orbit around the moon, would
also be canceled.
If enacted, “this is the largest single-year cut to NASA in American history,” said
Casey Dreier, the chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, a nonprofit
organization that advocates for space exploration. “This is a budget that says
America is done leading the world in space, that we are a nation turning inward.”
The budget plan also calls for scaling back operations at the International Space
Station, with fewer astronauts aboard and a slimmed-down research program. It
also proposes the elimination of NASA’s education efforts, portraying them as
“woke.” President Trump had tried to cancel NASA’s education efforts during his
first term — as had President Obama before him — but in both cases, Congress
restored the money.
For aviation, the budget would eliminate research to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions from airplanes.
The budget also proposes a cut of more than $1 billion in “mission support,” saying
there are savings to be made by reducing employee head counts, maintenance,
construction and “environmental compliance activities.”
A report by the National Academies last September, however, called for NASA to
greatly boost its spending on upgrading its infrastructure, much of which dates to
the 1960s.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-budget-nasa-

Mike Baker,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,"Before the Fire, L.A. Tried to Restore Second Reservoir in Palisades","Seven months before fire swept through the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los
Angeles, the city’s water managers were formulating a plan to revive an old
reservoir to temporarily boost the area’s limited water capacity.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was exploring the option
because the neighborhood’s main reservoir — the Santa Ynez Reservoir — had
been taken offline as a result of a torn cover, which officials had begun preparations
to repair early in 2024. The repair project was still months away from completion
this January when the fire broke out, and with the reservoir empty, firefighters ran
short of water in fighting the blaze.
Emails released to The New York Times under public records law show that the
city had searched for solutions to rectify the monthslong supply shortage but,
despite lengthy discussions and preliminary preparations, failed to correct the
problem in time.
In early June 2024, crews spent several days cleaning the Pacific Palisades
Reservoir, a facility that was about three miles away from the larger Santa Ynez
site, and that was retired in 2013. The work, officials wrote, was “in preparation for
temporarily placing the Pacific Palisades Reservoir back into service while the
Santa Ynez Reservoir is out of service.”
After the cleaning was completed, the crews planned more work, including
disinfection of the area and installation of new pipes.
But the plan to bring the old reservoir back online was never completed. Ellen
Cheng, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said
in an email on Friday that the city ultimately determined that bringing the
reservoir back online could have posed a risk to workers and residents of nearby
homes because of structural and other safety issues.
By the time the fire started in early January, the Pacific Palisades Reservoir
remained out of service and the Santa Ynez Reservoir was still two months away
from being operable.
The inability to bring either reservoir back online seriously undermined the
potential water supply in the area. The Santa Ynez Reservoir could hold tens of
millions of gallons of water. The Pacific Palisades Reservoir could hold more than
six million gallons.
Instead, when forecasts showed high fire danger before the inferno broke out, city
officials said they relied on a much smaller storage supply — three tanks in the
area that had a capacity of about one million gallons each. Hours after the fire’s
eruption on the morning of Jan. 7, by 4:45 p.m., one of those tanks was depleted.
Another was emptied that night. The third was drained by 3 a.m. the next day,
while the fire was still burning. Firefighters reported hydrants running dry in some
areas.
It is not certain how much of a difference the extra supply could have made. But it
appears clear that the second reservoir, if activated, could have helped maintain
total water capacity, in part by helping to sustain water pressure in the area.
Matthew Stumpf, a lawyer who is part of a legal team representing more than 750
wildfire victims, said they had been trying to get records and answers from the city
about how both reservoirs were managed. He said water supply issues were
central to some of the legal claims surrounding the fire.
“We believe it played a role in the destruction,” he said, adding that fire victims had
not been informed that the city had considered restarting the Pacific Palisades
Reservoir site.
That site had long been considered a firefighting supplement. Before the city
worked to add a floating cover on the Santa Ynez reservoir to improve water
quality and security, city officials added a cistern at the Pacific Palisades Reservoir
where firefighters could land a helicopter to refill their supply.
Ms. Cheng said the reservoir, built in 1929, had been retired because its low
elevation meant water sat there longer than was ideal, creating quality issues. She
said cracks were also causing leaks and the reservoir’s roof was compromised.
In recent weeks, crews completed the repair project at the Santa Ynez Reservoir,
and the city started refilling the reservoir, hoping to restore it to service this week.
But in the process, city officials said, more leaks were discovered, and it had to be
drained again.
City officials say they now hope to have the Santa Ynez Reservoir back in service
by the end of June.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/palisades-fire-reservoir-water-los-

Tony Romm,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Proposes $163 Billion in Cuts Across Government in New Budget,"President Trump on Friday proposed slashing $163 billion in federal spending next
fiscal year, a drastic retrenchment in the role and reach of government that, if
enacted, would eliminate a vast set of climate, education, health and housing
programs, including some that benefit the poor.
Issuing his first budget proposal since returning to office, Mr. Trump sketched out a
dim view of Washington. His blueprint depicted many core government functions
as woke, weaponized, wasteful or radical, as the president looked to justify his
request that Congress chop domestic spending to its lowest level in the modern
era.
Record-Low Funding for Domestic Programs
President Trump’s budget proposes shrinking nondefense funding to its lowest level since
the 1960s, when these records began.

Mr. Trump proposed cutting funding for some federal law enforcement, including
the F.B.I. He called on lawmakers to slash money meant to police tax evasion at the
Internal Revenue Service. He recommended striking billions in funds that help
finance clean water projects. And the president reserved some of his deepest cuts
for education, health and science, including the National Institutes of Health and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which would see their budgets cut
by around half.
Democrats immediately rebuked Mr. Trump for his proposal. Senator Chuck
Schumer of New York, the Senate minority leader, called it “heartless” and an “all-
out assault on hardworking Americans.” Even some Republicans took issue with
Mr. Trump’s budget, although others, like Speaker Mike Johnson, endorsed the
blueprint.
Mr. Trump also asked Congress to reduce, if not eliminate, billions of dollars in
federal aid to help the poorest Americans. For one, the White House called for
reconfiguring federal programs that provide rental assistance to low-income
families, cutting aid by more than $26 billion next fiscal year. And the
administration proposed the termination of a federal initiative, backed by some
Republicans, that aids needy families in paying their monthly heating bills.
In one of the few spending increases included in the budget, Mr. Trump asked
lawmakers to bolster spending at the Department of Homeland Security by more
than $43 billion, furthering his work to crack down on immigration, conduct

deportations and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. The president also
requested more than $1 trillion for the military next fiscal year.
But he asked lawmakers to approve that increase essentially on a one-time basis,
as part of a broader legislative package — due later this year — meant to advance
the president’s tax agenda. The approach angered some Republicans, who signaled
they would pursue a larger increase to military spending as part of the yearly
process to fund government agencies and programs.
“It is peculiar how much time the president’s advisers spend talking about
restoring peace through strength, given how apparently unwilling they’ve been to
invest accordingly in the national defense or in other critical instruments of
national power,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republicans’
former Senate leader, in a statement that denounced the administration’s
“accounting gimmicks.”
For Mr. Trump, the budget served to formalize his conservative vision and his
disruptive reorganization of the government, a campaign that has already
shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of federal workers without the
explicit approval of Congress.
Some of Mr. Trump’s proposed military increases could benefit Elon Musk, the tech
billionaire who has advised Mr. Trump on cost-cutting as part of the Department of
Government Efficiency
Mr. Trump’s budget supported the creation of a new missile defense shield and a
renewed campaign for “U.S. space dominance.” Both are areas in which Mr. Musk
and his rocket company, SpaceX, could stand to win major contracts funded by any
increase in spending.
Proposed Budget Change by Agency

In a letter Friday accompanying the spending blueprint, Russell T. Vought, the
leader of the White House budget office, said the administration had produced its
submission after a “rigorous, line-by-line review of spending.”
Mr. Vought added that the president sought to root out money “contrary to the
needs of ordinary working Americans and tilted toward funding niche,
nongovernmental organizations and institutions of higher education committed to
radical gender and climate ideologies antithetical to the American way of life.”
Sharon Parrott, the president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, said many of the budget changes contemplated by Mr. Trump still
seemed most likely to fall hardest on low-income Americans, particularly those
who rely on government services.
“This is the latest repudiation of some of what he promised on the campaign trail,
in terms of being a president who was going to seek to serve people struggling at
the margins of the economy,” she said.

Mr. Trump’s proposal is not law. Totaling about $1.7 trillion, after accounting for the
full set of spending changes the president seeks, the budget serves only as a formal
guide to Congress, where it immediately generated opposition.
“President Trump has made his priorities clear as day: He wants to outright
defund programs that help working Americans while he shovels massive tax
breaks at billionaires like himself and raises taxes on middle-class Americans with
his reckless tariffs,” Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the leading Democrat on
the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.
The criticism was not limited to Democrats, as Republicans also raised alarm about
cuts to some programs that serve the neediest Americans. Outlining her “serious
objections,” Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who leads the
Appropriations Committee, added in a statement: “Ultimately, it is Congress that
holds the power of the purse.”
By releasing the budget, Mr. Trump set the stage for what is bound to be a
complicated, monthslong process to fund the government and avert a shutdown
before an existing spending deal expires on Sept. 30. Entering that fight, many
Republicans have echoed Mr. Trump’s desire to slash federal spending, though
warring G.O.P. factions have disagreed at times over the exact scope.
Party lawmakers have also raced to identify potentially trillions of dollars in cuts
that they can include to finance a related package that would expand a set of
expiring tax cuts for families and businesses, one of the president’s signature —
and costliest — economic policy priorities.
But Mr. Trump’s proposal carries additional significance. He and his top budget
adviser, Mr. Vought, subscribe to the idea that the commander in chief wields
expansive authority to halt or cancel spending, even if Congress instructs
otherwise. Their view has paved the way for the administration to slow, freeze or
cancel billions of dollars in funds, sparking a vast array of lawsuits and prompting
more than three dozen ongoing federal investigations into their activities.
On Friday, Mr. Trump’s proposal left unanswered some of the most important
questions facing Washington and its finances. It was silent on the nation’s fiscal
trajectory, even as the president seeks to cut taxes in a sprawling and costly
legislative package that carries substantial implications for the nation’s $36 trillion
debt.
“It remains to be seen what the rest of the president’s proposals will hold, and
there is still the multitrillion-dollar question of whether the reconciliation bill will
blow up the debt,” said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a
Responsible Federal Budget, a group that advocates deficit reduction.
Nor did the president’s new budget address the future of the federal benefit
programs, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, that comprise the
largest share of federal spending annually. Some Republicans are particularly
interested in rethinking Medicaid, which provides health insurance to poor
families, as a source of savings to pay for their tax cuts.
The administration is expected to send those details in a fuller budget to Congress
as soon as this month.

Michael Levenson,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,‘No Appointments Here’: A Mad Dash to Get a Real ID Ahead of the Deadline,"Some have logged on late at night. Others have driven for hours. And some have
just given up. All in the hunt for a coveted appointment for a Real ID.
Starting on Wednesday, travelers in the United States will need a Real ID, passport
or other federally recognized document to board domestic flights, a requirement
that has sent many Americans scrambling for the security-enhanced, star-
emblazoned identification cards.
Perhaps nowhere is the search for appointments as intense as it is in New Jersey,
where just 17 percent of state-issued IDs are Real IDs, according to a recent CBS
News analysis of data from state motor vehicle agencies across the country. No
other state had a lower compliance rate.
Melissa Sussko, 26, of Nutley, N.J., said the only reason she had managed to find an
appointment for a Real ID at the Motor Vehicle Commision office in Wayne, N.J.,
was because a friend had recommended looking for openings on the agency’s
website at midnight. So she logged on at midnight and snagged one.
Another friend, she said, was planning to drive to Cape May, on the southern tip of
New Jersey, to get her Real ID at the only Motor Vehicle Commission office where
she could find an appointment.
“Everyone I know is fighting to get one,” Ms. Sussko said. “You can’t find any, at
all.”
Al Sohi, 54, a driving instructor in North Caldwell, N.J., said he had given up
looking for an appointment and planned to use his passport if he needed to travel.
“I wanted to get a Real ID; I can’t find the appointment,” he said. “It’s terrible.
They should do something to accommodate all the people who want a Real ID.”
Some people have traveled far for an appointment, and others have simply given up.

Some other states say they are also struggling to handle a surge of interest in Real
IDs, as news spreads that the Department of Homeland Security will require the
identification cards at airport checkpoints and federal facilities starting on
Wednesday, after repeatedly extending the deadline for years.
Long lines have been reported at motor vehicle offices in New York State, where 43
percent of state-issued IDs are Real IDs, and Maine, which has 27 percent
compliance, according to the CBS data. Pennsylvania, which reported 26 percent
compliance, has also faced a flood of applications.
“We have tens of thousands of folks weekly that are showing up at our driver’s
license centers to get the Real ID,” Michael B. Carroll, Pennsylvania’s secretary of
transportation, said at a recent news conference. “It’s a real challenge for us right
now because folks have waited until the last minute.”
CBS News found that 30 states were less than 70 percent compliant with the Real
ID requirement. Officials in many of those states, including New Jersey, say they
are working to accommodate everyone who needs a Real ID and emphasize that,
for many, there is no reason to panic.
“Demand is very high right now, and our challenges are not unique to New Jersey
— every state in the nation is facing similar pressures as enforcement approaches,”
said William Connolly, a spokesman for the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission.
New Jersey has been issuing about 23,000 Real IDs per week and posting
thousands of new appointments on its online scheduling tool each morning, Mr.
Connolly said. New Jersey also has a Real ID “emergency issuance program” for
residents who have to fly within 14 days for “life-or-death reasons” or have other
“urgent travel plans.”
Officials expect demand for Real IDs to ease in the coming weeks and months. And
many travelers may not need Real IDs to fly. Passengers will still be able to pass
through airport security with other forms of acceptable identification such as a U.S.
passport, a Global Entry card, a Department of Defense ID or a permanent
resident card, according to the Transportation Security Administration.
Travelers who only have standard state-issued driver’s licenses should “expect to
face delays, additional screening and the possibility of not being permitted into the
security checkpoint,” the T.S.A. said in a statement last month. The agency
recommends that these passengers allow themselves an extra hour to pass
through airport security and says, if possible, to bring another form of
identification such as a birth certificate or a Social Security card.
Travelers without a Real ID will still be able to board a flight with their passports.
Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images
“We have other ways to verify your identity if you don’t have a Real ID or
acceptable form of ID but know that this process may take longer, so you’ll need to
arrive at the airport early, and you should be good to go,” the T.S.A. said in a recent
“Ask Me Anything” session on Reddit aimed at easing anxiety around the
Wednesday deadline.
New Jersey officials say there are several reasons relatively few residents have
gotten Real IDs, even though the state has been issuing them since 2019.
For one, New Jersey is the state with the highest percentage of citizens with
passports, 80 percent, according to data compiled by the Center for American
Progress. Those people will not need a Real ID to board a plane if they show their
passport.
New Jersey also allows undocumented immigrants to get driver’s licenses, but
they cannot obtain a Real ID because the federal standards require proof of legal
status.
Residents in New Jersey can upgrade to a Real ID when renewing their licenses,
but they are not required to. Some other states like Maryland, which has 99 percent
Real ID compliance, require residents who are renewing to get Real IDs.
To apply for a Real ID, people generally need to provide a Social Security number
or proof of ineligibility, verify their address with utility bills, bank statements or
other documents, and prove their identity and legal status with additional
documents, including a birth certificate or a passport.
Gathering those documents is one thing. Finding an appointment is another. “I
went online and no appointments here, no appointments in Wyckoff,” said Lou
Petricone, 75, of Wayne, N.J., who has his Real ID but was hoping to get one for his
wife. “And my son-in-law is a principal in Nutley, and he had to go to Piscataway
and he was there for three hours.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/real-id-passport-domestic-

Chris Cameron;Maggie Haberman,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Considers Executive Order on College Athlete Payments,"President Trump is considering an executive order to examine payments made to
college athletes and whether they have created an unfair system, two people
briefed on the matter said Friday.
Mr. Trump’s focus on the issue — which he’s talked about in the past, one of the
people briefed on the matter noted — was renewed after he spoke with Nick Saban,
the famed former University of Alabama football coach, backstage at an event
Thursday night in Tuscaloosa, where Mr. Trump delivered an address to graduates.
The Wall Street Journal first reported on Mr. Trump’s consideration. The two
people who were briefed on it were not authorized to speak publicly.
The executive order would address newly expanded opportunities for student-
athletes to monetize their athletic careers. Last year, the N.C.A.A., the organization
that governs much of college sports, agreed to settle a class-action antitrust lawsuit
that had accused it and its member schools of exploiting student-athletes while
hoarding the profits of the lucrative college sports industry.
The $2.8 billion settlement, which is nearing approval, created a revenue-sharing
plan for college athletics in which schools would start directly paying their athletes,
a major shake-up of the college sports landscape. The N.C.A.A. has already
removed restrictions on athletes monetizing their athletic careers through
endorsements and sponsorships — known as “name, image and likeness”
payments.
The changes initiated an arms race in college athletics, as wealthy teams offered
larger and larger compensation packages to lure top talent into their programs.
Star players have since signed deals worth millions of dollars.
Mr. Saban, while coaching the Alabama Crimson Tide football team, criticized the
payments, saying that the system favored wealthy college sports programs that
could afford to offer better compensation to the best players. He argued that the
system was not “sustainable.”
Mr. Saban could not be immediately reached for comment. Other critics have said
the payments are distorting the competitiveness of college sports, beyond football.
This year’s men’s national basketball tournament, beloved by fans for its
unpredictability, featured the fewest upsets in recent memory.
Mr. Trump, who in the 1980s owned a team in the short-lived United States Football
League, has many allies among celebrity athletes and wealthy team owners. He
has been quick to weigh in on sports issues as a candidate and as president.
Mr. Trump is particularly vocal on cultural shifts in sports. In 2017, he urged N.F.L.
owners to fire players who did not stand for the national anthem as a way to
protest racial injustice and police brutality. He has defended the names of sports
teams with Native American names and images, criticizing the ultimately
successful movement to change them as political correctness.
The president has continued to fixate on that particular issue. As recently as last
week, Mr. Trump again criticized the name changes for those teams and
announced his opposition to the changing of a sports mascot of a public high school
on Long Island.
“I think the Indian population is a great part of this country,” Mr. Trump said,
adding, “I think it’s degrading to the Indian population.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-college-athlete-payments.html
Eileen Sullivan;Glenn Thrush;Maggie Haberman,NYT,1,US,5/1/2025,"Chris Krebs, Ex-Leader of Cybersecurity Agency, Is Under Investigation, Trump Officials Say","Trump administration officials said on Thursday that Chris Krebs, who debunked
President Trump’s lies about the 2020 election as head of the federal cybersecurity
agency, lost his membership in an expedited customs program for travelers
because he is facing a federal investigation.
The officials declined to specify why Mr. Krebs was under investigation, nor did
they indicate which agencies were conducting the inquiry. The disclosure came
three weeks after Mr. Trump, in an act of score settling and intimidation, directed
the Justice Department to investigate Mr. Krebs.
“Chris Krebs is under active investigation by law enforcement agencies,” a
spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. “That is
a fact disqualifying him for global entry.”
The department offered no further explanation about the inquiry into Mr. Krebs,
who was appointed to lead the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
by Mr. Trump in 2018. Asked about the suspension of Mr. Krebs’s Global Entry

Agency Is Under Investigation
travel program status, a White House official supplied a similar statement, offering
no other details. The official did not respond to a follow-up question.
It is unusual for a government law enforcement agency to confirm or deny an open
investigation. Mr. Trump has cited comparable breaches of protocol in accusing law
enforcement of trying to smear him during various investigations into his conduct.
The Global Entry program, administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a
division of the Homeland Security Department, allows low-risk travelers who have
passed a clearance process to avoid time-consuming screening procedures at
airports.
Mr. Krebs was fired after the 2020 election when he pushed back on
unsubstantiated claims by Trump allies that government super computers had
secretly switched votes from Mr. Trump to Mr. Biden. He later created a website to
fact-check allegations by Trump allies.
“The Nov. 3 election was the most secure in American history,” wrote Mr. Krebs,
along with state election officials, in a statement posted to the cybersecurity
agency’s website shortly before he was fired.
“There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes,
or was in any way compromised.”
The targeting of Mr. Krebs is the latest in a barrage of administration actions
intended to punish, embarrass, threaten and inconvenience Mr. Trump’s perceived
adversaries — in the case of Mr. Krebs, a respected public servant who offered a
factual corrective to his fabrications.
Mr. Krebs received an email on Wednesday alerting him that his status in the
Global Entry program had changed, prompting him to log into his account.
Even if Mr. Krebs is never charged, much less convicted, of any crime, the
allegations require him to devote time and resources to defending himself. A week
after Mr. Trump’s directive, Mr. Krebs resigned from the cybersecurity firm he had
joined, to focus on fighting the investigation.
A Justice Department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Mr.
Krebs had no comment.
In a memo Mr. Trump signed on April 9, he accused Mr. Krebs, a widely respected
cybersecurity executive, of being “a significant bad-faith actor who weaponized
and abused” his authority as a government official.
Among his purported misdeeds listed on the memo were “the censorship of
disfavored speech implicating the 2020 election” and the suppression of
“conservative viewpoints under the guise of combating supposed disinformation.”
Mr. Krebs was also stripped of his security clearance.
Since taking the presidency for a second time, Mr. Trump has been systematically
working through targets for retribution, most notably law firms that he has issued
or threatened to issue executive orders against.
The directive related to Mr. Krebs was the first time since taking office again that
Mr. Trump had publicly ordered investigations into individuals. Miles Taylor, a
Homeland Security Department official in the first Trump administration who has
been deeply critical of Mr. Trump, was also singled out.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/trump-chris-krebs.html
Madeleine Ngo,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Companies Are Raising Prices as Tariffs Hit,"More companies are starting to warn that they will have to pass on higher costs to
American consumers, raising prices for products like strollers, mattresses, power
tools and cast-iron cookware as President Trump’s tariffs take hold.
Some company officials said they had been left with no choice but to raise prices as
they pay more to import goods and materials into the United States. Other firms
have said they will soon run out of inventory for certain products because they
have paused orders from China.
Mr. Trump has upended the global trading system, hitting foreign countries with
punishing levies in an attempt to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United
States and take aim at what he calls “unfair” trade practices. But economic studies
have found that the burden of higher tariffs typically falls on domestic consumers
and companies.
Although Mr. Trump has scaled back some tariffs and paused others as he pursues
trade deals with foreign nations, the impacts of his policies are already starting to
eat into household budgets and frustrate Americans who have noticed higher

Prices Because of Tariffs

prices for their goods.
Some major companies have recently warned about impending price increases.
Stanley Black & Decker said on Wednesday that it raised prices on its tools and
outdoor products last month and will raise them again later this year. The German
sportswear company Adidas said this week that steeper tariffs would eventually
lead to higher prices for U.S. customers.
Executives at Procter & Gamble, which makes products like Bounty paper towels
and Tide detergent, said last week that the company would most likely increase
prices for some products to mitigate the effects of higher tariffs. And officials at
Hasbro recently said the toymaker would “have to raise prices,” although it would
try to “minimize the burden” on customers.
Some of the most immediate price increases have come in response to the
elimination of a loophole that allowed items worth $800 or less from China to enter
the United States without import fees. Shein and Temu, popular Chinese e-
commerce platforms, began adjusting prices for U.S. customers last week ahead of
the end of the tariff exemption on Friday.
Michelle Hall, a 48-year-old secretary in Snohomish, Wash., said she started buying
products from Temu late last year and has since spent about $2,300 on furniture,
car mats, sweaters, Christmas gifts and other inexpensive goods from the platform.
“It’s addicting and fun when you get your packages,” Ms. Hall said.
But over the weekend, she discovered extra “import charges” tacked onto her total.
A cart of six items from Temu that would have usually cost her $83.80 would cost
an extra $92.08 because of import fees, Ms. Hall said. On Wednesday, she noticed
that the platform appeared to take down many products that would have incurred
import fees, leaving only products that were shipped from local warehouses.
Ms. Hall said she planned to abandon Temu because she did not want to pay higher
prices, and its offerings seemed more limited now.
She said she still hoped that Mr. Trump’s tariffs would have some long-term
benefits. She voted for Mr. Trump in November, initially thinking his trade policies
could help reduce the deficit, create manufacturing jobs and make the nation less
dependent on foreign countries.
But Ms. Hall said she was not sure if those benefits would materialize. “In the
meantime, I feel like citizens are suffering,” she said.
Ms. Hall said she never thought her own costs would increase, and she originally
hoped that Mr. Trump would quickly bring prices down.
“I wanted to have faith,” she said. “I don’t have that faith anymore.”
Some companies have said they will begin raising prices in the coming weeks
because of higher tariffs. Joanna Rosenberg, the chief sales and marketing officer
at Zwilling J.A. Henckels, a German company that specializes in cutlery and other
kitchen products, said the firm would have to raise prices for some products in
early June. Premium knives from Zwilling and cast-iron cookware from Staub, one
of the company’s brands known for its Dutch ovens made in France, will see
“single-digit” price increases, Ms. Rosenberg said.
She said the company would have to raise prices more substantially for certain
knives from its value brand, Henckels. Some of those knives are produced in China,
which Mr. Trump has hit with a minimum 145 percent tariff. The president has
signaled that the rate could drop, though the White House has insisted it will not do
so unless China agrees to pare back its levies too.
“We don’t want to increase prices,” Ms. Rosenberg said. “There’s just no way that
we can absorb some of these price increases.”
As the cost of importing goods and materials into the United States rises, some major companies have

Some industries are being hit particularly hard because the bulk of their products
are made in China. About 90 percent of durable baby and children’s products sold in
the United States are manufactured overseas, with the vast majority produced in
China, according to the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association.
Several companies that sell strollers and car seats said they would have to increase
prices to offset higher costs from tariffs. UPPAbaby said last month that it would
adjust prices across most products. Evenflo increased prices between 10 to 40
percent for most of its products on Thursday. Cybex also increased prices for some
products on Thursday, which company officials said was “unavoidable.”
Steven Dunn, the chief executive of Munchkin, which sells products like high
chairs, strollers and diaper pails, said the company will likely have to increase
prices at a minimum of 20 percent for many products soon. And Mr. Dunn said the
company might have to discontinue 30 to 40 percent of its products after its current
inventory dwindles within an estimated 10 weeks.
“There are a lot of products that we just will not order anymore at the current
rates,” Mr. Dunn said. “You can’t pass on a 145 percent tariff to the consumer and
expect them to buy the same product.”
Mr. Dunn said that Munchkin paused its orders from China last month, and officials
have tried to move as much manufacturing out of the country as possible. Although
Mr. Trump has urged companies to make more products in the United States,
producing more baby products domestically is complex. “The tooling, the skills and
the automation just doesn’t exist here,” Mr. Dunn said.
Companies that make products in America are not immune to the impacts of higher
import fees, either.
Vy Nguyen, the chief executive officer at Avocado Green Mattress, said all of its
organic mattresses were made in the Los Angeles area. But many of the “core
natural components” that are used to make its mattresses, such as wool and latex,
are sourced from countries including India, Thailand and Guatemala. Those
materials have risen in price because Mr. Trump has instituted a 10 percent blanket
tariff on nearly all trading partners.
Avocado plans to increase mattress prices by about 6 percent and other products
by an average of 7.5 percent starting on Tuesday, company officials said.
Some brands have been more vocal about price increases because they are worried
about their ability to pass on cost increases to consumers, said Simeon Siegel, a
retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets. The companies want to ensure that
consumers “don’t feel like they’re having the rug pulled out from under them,” he
said.
Réalisation Par, which sells an array of silk dresses, said in an email to customers
last month that officials would have to raise prices for U.S. orders starting May 2
because its “silk pieces have always been crafted with care and expertise in the
home of silk — China.” In the meantime, customers could take 20 percent off their
order until late April, according to the email.
Fatima Ocampo, a 24-year-old data analyst in Sacramento, Calif., said she was
already eyeing several dresses from Réalisation Par when she saw the email. Ms.
Ocampo said she was planning to wait to make a purchase, closer to when she will
leave for her honeymoon in the south of France this fall. But she wanted to take
advantage of the lower prices while she could, so she bought three dresses from the
brand for about $400 later that day.
“I feel like it’s a clear example of how these tariffs are going to be a burden put onto
the consumer,” Ms. Ocampo said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/companies-tariffs-price-increases.html
Eric Schmitt,NYT,1,US,5/1/2025,U.S. Creating Second Military Zone Along Southern Border,"The Pentagon is creating a second expanded military zone at the southwestern
border, to be patrolled by U.S. soldiers, in the Trump administration’s latest step to
militarize the boundary with Mexico to help stem the flow of migrants.
The military’s Northern Command said in a statement on Thursday evening that it
was establishing a narrow strip of land along the southern border of Texas that will
become part of Fort Bliss, near El Paso. The strip will be about 63 miles long.
Last month, the Pentagon created a 60-foot-wide strip of land along 200 miles of
the border between New Mexico and Mexico, effectively turning it into part of a
U.S. military base there.
Migrants entering the newly designated military installations, or national defense
areas, will be considered to be trespassing and can be temporarily detained by U.S.
troops until Border Patrol agents arrive, military officials said.
A small group of migrants was charged on Monday with crossing into the military
zone in New Mexico after an Army helicopter spotted them approaching the border
and alerted the Border Patrol.
“The establishment of a second national defense area increases our operational
reach and effectiveness in denying illegal activity along the southern border,” Gen.
Gregory M. Guillot, the head of Northern Command, said in a statement.
General Guillot said that “service members who are already detecting and
monitoring through stationary positions and mobile patrols nearby can now
temporarily detain trespassers until they are transferred to an appropriate law
enforcement entity.”
The new Pentagon directives expand a military presence that has increased
steadily along the southern border in recent months, even as crossings have
already dropped precipitously during the Trump administration.
The Pentagon has sent nearly 8,000 active-duty troops to the border, as well as spy
planes in the skies and Navy warships offshore, to comply with President Trump’s
order in January to increase the military’s role in stemming the flow of migrants
into the United States.
Armed infantry and support troops from the Fourth Infantry Division at Fort
Carson in Colorado — one of the Army’s most seasoned combat units — make up a
major portion of the ground force in what the Pentagon calls Joint Task Force-

Mattathias Schwartz,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,"In Texas Borderland, Trump’s Immigration Push Suffers Its Worst Legal Defeat Yet","Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr., a bespectacled, soft-spoken 56-year-old nominated
by President Trump, turned his high-backed leather chair toward a government
lawyer at the federal courthouse in Brownsville, Texas, and asked a question. Can
the president define what counts as an invasion, then declare that an invasion is
happening, and then use a 1798 war powers law to expel the so-called invaders?
“Yes,” answered Michael Velchik, a Justice Department lawyer.
Judge Rodriguez followed up: Wouldn’t that make Mr. Trump’s powers under the
wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, “effectively limitless?”
The question hinted at a groundbreaking ruling that Judge Rodriguez issued on
Thursday when he found that Mr. Trump was wrong to claim that the activities of
Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang in the United States, amounted to an “invasion”
that justified invoking the wartime law.
The decision was the most sweeping ruling issued so far by a federal judge
blocking the most aggressive prong of Mr. Trump’s effort, one that was already
used to deport nearly 140 Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador on March 15. It
comes after a Supreme Court decision in early April that Venezuelan detainees
facing potential deportation under the Alien Enemies Act could file lawsuits in the
district courts where they were being held.
Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. during
his Senate confirmation hearing in
2017.
C-SPAN
The result of the court’s order has been that challenges to a key piece of Mr.
Trump’s immigration agenda, which began in Washington, are spreading around
the country, filling the dockets of federal judges and drawing tough and skeptical
questioning — even from jurists with impeccable conservative credentials.
Judge Rodriguez’s order came after five other judges hearing challenges of
detainees related to the Alien Enemies Act issued temporary orders that blocked
deportations for some or all of those held in their districts. In Colorado, a judge
found that there cannot be an “invasion” without “military and wartime action” and
that the administration had “improperly” relied on the words as a legal basis for
deportations.
Texas, with its extensive network of Immigration and Customs Enforcement
detention facilities, is beginning to play an outsize role in the litigation. Judge
Rodriguez is one of three Texas judges who have so far heard challenges from
groups of Venezuelans. When one of his colleagues, Judge James Wesley Hendrix
in the Northern District of Texas, declined to stop the imminent deportation of
another group of Venezuelans held at the Bluebonnet Detention Facility in Anson,
the Supreme Court stepped in and issued an emergency order blocking it.
In another case, Judge David Briones of the Western District of Texas ordered the
immediate release of a Venezuelan couple, rejecting the government’s claims that
they were members of Tren de Aragua.
The cases in Texas are also notable because federal courts there are reviewed by
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the most aggressively conservative
appellate court, which has issued a number of rulings supporting hard-line
immigration policies.
The possibility of an appeal to the Fifth Circuit has driven the perception that Texas
courtrooms might offer Mr. Trump the best chance to win rulings that would allow
his administration’s plan to scale up mass deportations to move forward.
That makes the skepticism he is facing there especially notable, said Stephen
Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “The administration
might have been overconfident in fighting so hard to have these cases heard in
Texas,” he said. “There are some legal questions on which reasonable judges from
across the ideological spectrum will disagree. But whether we are under invasion
from — or otherwise at war with — Tren de Aragua just isn’t one of them.”
A spokesman for the White House did not respond to a request for comment.
The origins of the case before Judge Rodriguez date to March 14 at the El Valle
Detention Center, 50 miles north of Brownsville. From there, two buses carrying
more than 200 men set off for the airport at Harlingen, and from there to El
Salvador, despite an order from another judge in Washington, James E. Boasberg,
requiring them to return.
Mr. Trump has trained his ire on Judge Boasberg, painting him as a radical liberal.
The president might have hoped for a friendlier reception in front of Judge
Rodriguez, where three of the men tried suing after the Supreme Court’s ruling.
Judge Rodriguez sits less than a mile from the Mexican border. Each weekday, one
floor down from his courtroom, U.S. marshals bring forward a parade of border-
crossers, some in orange prison smocks, some still in the street clothes they were
arrested in hours before. On Thursday, they stood five and six at a time before a
magistrate judge who took sips from a Whataburger cup as some men stood for
their arraignments and others waived their right to a jury trial and pleaded guilty.
Still, Judge Rodriguez has not immediately embraced the drastic measures the
administration is taking to reboot the immigration system, a sign that Mr. Trump’s
claims about the extent of his own power may be too bold for some of his judicial
nominees.
Two weeks before the hearing, Judge Rodriguez had issued a temporary
restraining order that barred the government from using the Alien Enemies Act to
deport the three plaintiffs, or any other El Valle detainee.
The break with Mr. Trump was surprising, said Jodi Goodwin, an immigration
lawyer in Brownsville who often appears before the judge. Of Brownsville’s two
federal judges, Ms. Goodwin said Judge Rodriguez was known as “the more
conservative, more strict judge.”
Judge Rodriguez, who declined to comment for this article, was the first Latino
chosen by Mr. Trump for the federal bench. During his confirmation hearing in
2017, the judge talked about being raised by a single mother and living near the
poverty line. He went to Yale, the first in his family to attend a four-year college,
then the University of Texas Law School, and went on to make partner at Baker
Botts, a powerful Houston firm. For eight years, he worked overseas for the
International Justice Mission, an evangelical Christian group that fights human
trafficking. “All these experiences,” he told the Senate, “enable me to empathize
with the vulnerable, the poor and the disadvantaged.”
At the immigration hearing, Judge Rodriguez took a careful, inquisitive approach
as he scrutinized the claims about the word “invasion,” a crucial term from both the
statute and Mr. Trump’s proclamation on March 14 invoking the war powers law.
The judge said he was searching for “the plain, ordinary meaning” of the word as it
was understood in 1798.
Mr. Velchik said “invasion” and “predatory incursion” could be applied to nonstate
actors like “Indian tribes” and “Barbary pirates.” But when Judge Rodriguez asked
him to back it up with “sources from that time,” Mr. Velchik came up empty. The
attempt to discern the law’s original meaning, a staple of conservative
jurisprudence that has been used to protect the rights of gun owners and restrict
access to abortion, now seemed to be working against the administration’s agenda.
Abby’s Bakery in Los Fresnos, Texas, was temporarily shut down after an Immigration and Customs
Enforcement raid in February. Valerie Gonzalez/Associated Press
Elsewhere in Brownsville, there were broader questions about whether Mr.
Trump’s approach to immigration was consistent with local tradition. In February,
Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided Abby’s Bakery, a pastry shop 16
miles from Brownsville. They discovered workers who were living on the owners’
property. Two were undocumented, according to a complaint filed in court; six had
visas to visit the United States but not to work. The two owners were charged with
harboring aliens, a crime with a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. They have
pleaded not guilty, and their trial, also before Judge Rodriguez, is scheduled for
July.
Jaime M. Diez, the lawyer representing the bakery owners, said the case had made
ranchers reluctant to board seasonal migrants who work as ranch hands, a practice
in the region for generations. “Everyone is scared,” he said. “They’ve been
arresting people left and right.”
Toward the end of the hearing, Judge Rodriguez examined whether a government
plan to give detainees as little as 12 hours to challenge their detentions complied
with an order from the Supreme Court that they be allowed “reasonable time” to
sue. He asked how detainees could challenge it. If they were somehow able to file
quickly, they would not have suffered any injury, he said. But if they were not able
to file, then the government could fly them off to El Salvador, beyond the reach of
U.S. courts.
“From my perspective, there’s a Catch-22,” the judge said.
Ms. Goodwin, the immigration lawyer, said 12 hours was insufficient, given the
demands on lawyers’ time since Mr. Trump took office. “My clients are petrified,”
she said. “‘Are they going to come to my house? Are they going to come to the
schools? Can I go to the doctor? You’re the lawyer. Can’t you do something?’ I
spend so much time just trying to calm fears.”
Muneer Ahmad, a professor at Yale Law School who represents immigrants as part
of the school’s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, called Judge
Rodriguez’s ruling “well-reasoned” and “significant.”
“For a Trump-appointed judge to so unambiguously rule that the invocation of the
statute was unlawful,” he said, “I hope will hasten the end of this legal charade.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-deportees-texas.html
Theodore Schleifer,NYT,1,US,5/1/2025,Charles Koch Says Many in the Country Are ‘Abandoning’ Its Principles,"Charles Koch, the billionaire industrialist and conservative megadonor, made a
rare public appearance Thursday evening and called for libertarians to embrace
their principles, in comments that seemed obliquely directed at a Republican Party
taken over by President Trump.
Mr. Koch was at one time among the most powerful forces in Republican politics. In
the 2016 election cycle alone, he and his allies spent $750 million to promote the
party’s candidates and causes. But his political power has waned significantly since
Mr. Trump’s election that year, and he is now seldom seen in Washington. And
neither do Republicans worry much about his plans in a party that is much more in
Mr. Trump’s image than in Mr. Koch’s.
But Mr. Koch, who will turn 90 this November, showed up in Washington to accept
an award from the Cato Institute. Almost 50 years ago, Mr. Koch helped found Cato,
one of the nation’s prominent libertarian think tanks. By 2012, Mr. Koch and his
brother David had given about $30 million to the institute, but the relationship
soured and the Kochs ended up suing the nonprofit before settling that June.
Accepting a prize named after Milton Friedman, the free-market economist, on
Thursday, Mr. Koch made his first public remarks since Mr. Trump was
inaugurated in January and enacted a number of policies that are anathema to Mr.
Friedman’s and Mr. Koch’s politics, most notably the sweeping tariffs.
Mr. Koch dispensed with the cheery rhetoric of most conservatives these days.
Speaking about the subsidies and protectionism of the past, he said that “you can
see why we’re in the mess we’re in today.” The billionaire often speaks about his
core “principles"" in business and philanthropy.
“With so much change, chaos and conflict, too many people and organizations are
abandoning these principles,” Mr. Koch later said, not uttering Mr. Trump’s name.
He added, “But we know from history, this just makes the problems worse. And
people have forgotten that when principles are lost, so are freedoms.”
Mr. Koch’s political group announced a $20 million campaign this year to try to
encourage the renewal of Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. But Mr. Koch has made no
secret of his profound disagreements with the president. In 2024, the Koch network
took a more muscular approach, but to no avail, endorsing Nikki Haley in her bid
for the Republican nomination. “CHARLES KOCH AND HIS GROUP GOT
PLAYED FOR SUCKERS RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING!” Mr. Trump posted as
Ms. Haley’s campaign sputtered.
Mr. Koch still has financial capital, even if not always political: A super PAC tied to
Mr. Koch spent almost $180 million on the 2024 cycle, a sum that does not include
spending by affiliated nonprofit groups. Mr. Koch has a net worth of $66 billion,
according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making him the 22nd wealthiest
person in the world, just behind the family of Julia Flescher Koch, the widow of
David Koch, who died in 2019. Mr. Koch’s firm, Koch Inc., is the second-largest
privately owned company in the country (Cargill is No. 1).
Mr. Koch’s speech in a Washington ballroom made for his most prominent
engagement since at least the pandemic. He has done a few podcasts and
interviews as late as early 2022 to promote his 2020 book, but he has largely ceded
the spotlight to his son, Chase Koch.
Approaching his tenth decade, Mr. Koch still speaks volubly and moves well. When
his speech was interrupted by protesters, Mr. Koch was not fazed.
“When you have those kind of enemies, you know you’re doing the right thing,” he
said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/charles-koch-trump-republicans-tariffs.html
Andrew Duehren;Maggie Haberman;Alan Blinder,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Says He’s ‘Taking Away’ Harvard’s Tax Exempt Status,"Harvard University signaled Friday that it would resist President Trump’s renewed
threat to revoke the school’s tax-exempt status, a move for which it said there was
“no legal basis” as the president escalated his bitter dispute with the nation’s oldest
university.
Harvard stopped short of explicitly pledging a legal challenge to a revocation of its
tax status, a change that would upend the university’s finances. But a
spokesperson for the university said in a statement that there was “no legal basis
to rescind Harvard’s tax-exempt status.”
“Such an unprecedented action would endanger our ability to carry out our
educational mission,” the statement said. “It would result in diminished financial
aid for students, abandonment of critical medical research programs and lost
opportunities for innovation. The unlawful use of this instrument more broadly
would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America.”
Harvard Signals It Will Resist Trump’s Efforts to
Revoke Tax-Exempt Status
Mr. Trump declared Friday morning on social media that the government would be
“taking away Harvard’s Tax Exempt Status.” Mr. Trump added, “It’s what they
deserve.”
Despite Mr. Trump’s assertion online and Harvard’s sharp response, it was not
immediately clear Friday whether the I.R.S. was in fact moving forward with
revoking Harvard’s tax-exempt status, a change that could typically occur only
after a lengthy process. Federal law prohibits the president from directing the
I.R.S. to conduct tax investigations, and I.R.S. employees who receive such a
command are required to report it to an internal government watchdog.
After Mr. Trump first publicly called for Harvard to lose its tax exemption last
month, White House officials said that the I.R.S. would make its own conclusion
about whether to do so.
Representatives for the I.R.S. and Treasury Department, which oversees the tax
collector, did not respond to a request for comment.
With its tax-exempt status, Harvard not only does not have to pay most taxes, but
donors can write off gifts to the school on their own tax returns. Losing the status
would not only force Harvard to start paying tax to the federal government on its
income but could cause donations to dry up. Philanthropy accounts for about 45
percent of Harvard’s annual operating revenues; most of that sum comes from a
payout from the university’s $53 billion endowment.
The intensifying standoff between the Trump administration and Harvard is part of
a broad pressure campaign against some of the nation’s most elite universities,
which the administration has painted as hotbeds of antisemitism and
discrimination that require federal intervention.
In recent weeks, Harvard has taken a decidedly confrontational posture toward the
Trump administration. The university rejected a roster of demands from the
government, including that it submit reports to Washington, alter its admissions
and hiring policies and bring in an outsider to examine “those programs and
departments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.”
The university sued after the administration froze more than $2 billion in federal
funds in retaliation for Harvard’s defiance.
Even before Mr. Trump first called for Harvard to lose its tax exemption, the Trump
administration has sought to transform the typically technocratic I.R.S. into a
political tool.
Trump officials pressured the I.R.S. to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement
find people it is seeking to deport, a decision that agency officials warned
undermined legal protections for taxpayer information. (I.R.S. officials can face
prison time if they improperly share taxpayer information, including details about
whether an individual or entity is facing an audit.)
The agency has had five different leaders so far this year, with the current acting
commissioner, Michael Faulkender, taking over after Treasury Secretary Scott
Bessent complained to Mr. Trump that Elon Musk had installed the previous acting
leader behind his back. Mr. Faulkender is also the deputy Treasury secretary.
Republicans have long accused the I.R.S. of improperly scrutinizing conservatives,
leading a series of investigations under the Obama administration into the
agency’s treatment of Tea Party groups. An inspector general later concluded that
the agency had improperly targeted both conservative and liberal organizations.
“I think Republicans should be quite cautious about using the I.R.S. against any
particular sector or narrow group of organizations,” said Scott Hodge, the former
president of the Tax Foundation, a think tank that favors lower taxes.
“Weaponizing the I.R.S. in any form is wrong. Policies should always be uniform
and neutral and based on tax principles.”
A group of Democratic senators — led by Chuck Schumer of New York, the
minority leader — wrote to the Treasury inspector general for tax administration,
the I.R.S. watchdog, to request that it investigate Mr. Trump’s targeting of Harvard.
They wrote that “it is both illegal and unconstitutional for the I.R.S. to take
direction from the president” on assessing tax-exempt groups.
Typically, the I.R.S. will challenge a group’s tax-exempt status after conducting a
lengthy audit to determine whether, for example, the entity is engaging in too much
political or commercial activity. If the I.R.S. decides to revoke a tax exemption, the
group can appeal the decision in court. Given Harvard’s vast research and
educational operations, tax experts expect a court would ultimately side with the
school.
“Been there, done that,” said Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on
Education and an under secretary of education during the Obama administration.
“The president has been saying this for weeks. Nothing has changed to make it
possible for him to take unilateral action on an institution’s nonprofit status.”
Even if the I.R.S. does not ultimately change Harvard’s tax status, Republicans are
preparing to substantially increase a tax on university endowments that the party
created in 2017.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-exempt-status.html
Karoun Demirjian;John Ismay,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Veterans’ Groups Object to Trump’s Proposal to Rename Veterans Day,"President Trump’s announcement that he planned to change the name of Veterans
Day, on Nov. 11, to “Victory Day for World War I” prompted a backlash from some
veterans’ groups, which complained that the move would champion conquest over
sacrifice and ignore the sacrifices of most living veterans.
In a social media post late Thursday, Mr. Trump also said he would declare May 8,
the date that Nazi Germany surrendered in 1945, “Victory Day for World War II”
instead of Victory in Europe Day, or V-E Day, as it is commonly known in the
United States.
But some veterans’ advocacy groups said the focus of the new names on winning
overlooked veterans who served in more recent wars that had more mixed results.
“It is not the veterans’ fault if we don’t win wars,” said Allison Jaslow, the chief
executive of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, who also served in Iraq.
She added that “Veterans Day should be an acknowledgment of the ways that
fellow Americans have served and sacrificed to protect and defend what we have in
America.”
In 2023, the census counted 15.8 million veterans living in America. This year, the
Department of Veterans Affairs estimated that about 66,000 American World War
II veterans were alive. There are no surviving veterans of World War I.
That means that with Mr. Trump’s proposed name changes, more than 99 percent
of living veterans — a group that includes Vice President JD Vance, who served
with the Marines in Iraq — would be left without a holiday commemorating their
service.
Congress recognized the need for a holiday that would encompass the service of all
veterans in 1954, when it passed legislation to formalize Nov. 11 as Veterans Day.
Since 1919, the date had been recognized as Armistice Day, in honor of the
agreement that the Allied powers and Germany signed to end World War I in 1918.
Congress had made Armistice Day an official federal holiday in 1938.
Though presidents enjoy fairly wide latitude to recognize certain occasions or
individuals by executive order, only Congress can create binding federal holidays,
meaning Mr. Trump cannot unilaterally force an official name change for Veterans
Day, which is one of 12 federal holidays that were established by law.
Some veterans’ groups pointed to the history of how Veterans Day was expanded
to include all veterans to argue that Mr. Trump’s proposal was undermining the
spirit of the holiday.
“Veterans Day began as Armistice Day, honoring the end of World War I — then it
was changed to honor ALL who served,” the group VoteVets, a left-leaning political
action committee, wrote in a social media post, adding: “Veterans don’t need
rewritten history. They need respect — and the benefits they earned.”
Democrats have argued that the Trump administration’s cuts to the V.A., which are
expected to include a reduction of 80,000 workers, will undermine veterans’
benefits.
A spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, a nonpartisan advocacy
organization created in the 19th century, said the group had reached out to the
White House to clarify Mr. Trump’s plans and inform the president that it continued
to endorse having the holiday honor the service of all veterans.
“Since the original legislation was introduced to change the name of Armistice Day
to Veterans Day — a day that is dedicated to all veterans who fought for peace —
the V.F.W. has endorsed that change,” said Rob Couture, a spokesman for the
organization’s Washington, D.C., office.
In February, Al Lipphardt, the group’s national commander, issued a statement
criticizing the Trump administration’s plan to cut tens of thousands of jobs from the
V.A., and spoke against it in congressional testimony.
Another major veterans group, the Disabled American Veterans, offered the most
succinct response to Mr. Trump’s proposal.
Their statement posted online said, “No.”
But one of the largest veterans’ service organizations has been notably silent on
the president’s Veterans Day announcement.
A spokeswoman for the American Legion, which was created through
congressional charter after World War I and calls itself “the nation’s most
influential, effective and dependable advocate of veteran affairs,” declined to
comment on Mr. Trump’s idea. The group also declined multiple requests for
comment in February when Mr. Trump allowed Elon Musk to fire tens of thousands
of federal employees, of which roughly 30 percent are military veterans.
Vietnam Veterans of America, which was started in 1978 and given a congressional
charter in 1986, did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Trump’s proposed renaming would effectively return Nov. 11 to its original
status as a holiday exclusively marking World War I. But while May 8 is recognized
as the end of World War II’s fighting in Europe, it is not the date that the United
States declared victory in the overall war.
The battles in the Pacific theater dragged on for several more months and were
punctuated by America’s use of nuclear weapons against Japan in Hiroshima on
Aug. 6, 1945, and Nagasaki on Aug. 9. Just days later, Emperor Hirohito of Japan
announced that his country would surrender unconditionally. Victory Over Japan
Day, or V-J Day, is celebrated in the United States on Aug. 14 because of the time
difference when that announcement was made.
But Japan did not sign a formal surrender agreement until Sept. 2.
Mr. Trump argued in his social media post that “many of our allies and friends”
already recognized May 8 as Victory Day, and that the United States should follow
suit because in World War II, “we did more than any other Country, by far.”
“We won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or
military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything,” he wrote. “That’s because we
don’t have leaders anymore, that know how to do so! We are going to start
celebrating our victories again!”
Poland and France celebrate Victory Day on May 8, while Russia celebrates it on
May 9.
Since the start of his second term, Mr. Trump has announced a series of name
changes. He ordered that the Gulf of Mexico be renamed the Gulf of America. Mr.
Trump also renamed the tallest mountain in North America as Mount McKinley,
undoing a 2015 decision that had restored the peak’s Alaska Native name, Denali.
This week, he announced via social media that he was “reinstating Columbus Day,”
though it has been a congressionally established federal holiday since 1934.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-veterans-day.html
Alan Rappeport,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,"U.S. and China Dig In on Trade War, With No Plans for Formal Talks","As trade tensions flared between the world’s largest economies, communication
between the United States and China has been so shaky that the two superpowers
cannot even agree on whether they are talking at all.
At a White House economic briefing this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent
demurred multiple times when pressed about President Trump’s recent claim that
President Xi Jinping of China had called him. Although top economic officials might
usually be aware of such high-level talks, Mr. Bessent insisted that he was not
logging the president’s calls.
“I have a lot of jobs around the White House; running the switchboard isn’t one of
them,” Mr. Bessent joked.
But the apparent silence between the United States and China is a serious matter
for the global economy.

Markets are fixated on the mystery of whether back-channel discussions are
taking place. Although the two countries have not severed all ties, it does seem that
they have gone dark when it comes to conversations about tariffs.
“China and the U.S. have not held consultations or negotiations on the issue of
tariffs,” Guo Jiakun, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, said at a news
conference last Friday. “The United States should not confuse the public.”
However, China’s Commerce Ministry said this Friday that it was now considering
holding talks with the Trump administration after repeated attempts by senior U.S.
officials to start negotiations. White House and Treasury Department officials did
not respond to requests for comment about whether such outreach had occurred.

other economic barriers. Those levies, which sent global financial markets
plunging, were paused for 90 days to give countries time to reach agreements with
the United States.
China, which reached a largely unfulfilled trade pact with Mr. Trump during his
first term, has indicated that it has little interest in talking about a new agreement
until the United States rolls back what it views as a barrage of aggressive and
unfair trade measures.
Mr. Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports to a minimum of 145 percent last
month, in a bid to force China into trade negotiations. Chinese officials responded
by issuing their own tariffs on American products and clamping down on exports to
the United States of minerals and magnets that are necessary for many industries.
The economic toll of the tit for tat is starting to become clear. The International
Monetary Fund last month lowered its growth outlook for both countries and the
world, warning that the tariffs had made a downturn more likely. Government data
released this week showed Chinese factory activity slowing in April and first-
quarter growth in the United States weakening.
During a cabinet meeting on Wednesday at the White House, Mr. Trump
acknowledged that children in the United States may wind up with fewer dolls that
cost more. But he insisted that he would continue to push for a “fair deal” with
China, which he described as the “leading candidate for the chief ripper-offer.”
The Trump administration is focused on trade deals with about 18 of America’s
most important trading partners that are subject to the reciprocal tariffs. Mr.
Bessent indicated that talks with China would operate on a separate track from the
other negotiations.
The Treasury secretary is expected to take the lead on the China negotiations while
Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, oversees most of the other talks.
However, Mr. Trump has not formally appointed or authorized a U.S. official to
negotiate on his behalf with China, leaving Chinese officials to believe that the
Trump administration is not ready or serious about trade talks.

country’s confrontation with Mr. Trump over tariffs. Doug Mills/The New York Times
Mr. Bessent, who had an introductory call with his Chinese counterpart in
February, said that he held informal talks with Chinese officials over issues such as
financial stability during the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank last week. He said that they spoke about more “traditional
things” but did not say that trade was discussed. The Treasury Department did not
issue a summary of any meetings with Chinese officials.
In an interview with Fox News this week, Jamieson Greer, the United States trade
representative, said that he met virtually for over an hour with his Chinese
counterpart before April 2 but that there had been no talks since Mr. Trump
announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs.
Our economics reporters — based in New York, London, Brussels, Berlin, Hong
Kong and Seoul — are digging into every aspect of the tariffs causing global turmoil.
They are joined by dozens of reporters writing about the effects on everyday people.’
Here’s our latest reporting on tariffs and economic policy.
Mr. Trump has suggested that Mr. Xi should call him to begin the talks personally,
noting their strong personal relationship. But that is not how China typically
handles important economic matters. The United States and China traditionally
work out their economic differences through a structured dialogue with formal
meetings and working groups led by a top economic official from each country.
“This very personalistic approach by President Trump, who wants to negotiate
directly with President Xi, doesn’t match with the Chinese system at all,” said Craig
Allen, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis. “In
the Chinese system, these things are carefully negotiated in advance, they go up
multiple channels and it is highly controlled and scripted, and when it gets to the
leader stage it is highly choreographed.”
Mr. Allen, who until recently was the president of the U.S.-China Business Council,
suggested that China was most likely mindful of the acrimonious meeting that Mr.
Trump had with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in February and that
Mr. Xi would be wary of a situation that could lead to a public confrontation with
Mr. Trump.
During the Biden administration, Treasury Department officials worked with China
to create economic and financial working groups of midlevel staff members that
were intended to prevent tensions over tariffs and export controls from spiraling
out of control. Those lines of communication do not appear to be in use in the
Trump administration, which tends to view them as a waste of time.
“That is exactly the kind of thing that these groups can help do — help make sure
that the policy you deploy is well tailored to achieve the objective and
communicates to the other side what you’re trying to achieve before it’s too late
and you instead have to react to potentially unintended consequences or a
message that was not intended to be transmitted,” said Brent Neiman, a University
of Chicago professor who was the Treasury’s deputy under secretary for
international finance during the Biden administration.
During Mr. Trump’s first term, the president initially assigned the Treasury
secretary at the time, Steven T. Mnuchin, to lead trade delegations to China. He
later appointed Robert E. Lighthizer, his trade representative, who was viewed as
more hawkish, to oversee the talks.
Veterans of that trade war believe the current deadlock could be more protracted
because the tariffs are higher and both sides believe they are winning. If U.S.
growth continues to slow while prices start to rise, it could add to the urgency for
Mr. Trump to get real talks with China going.
“I think at some point we have to give them a graceful off ramp,” said Wilbur Ross,
who served as Mr. Trump’s commerce secretary during his first term. “Whether
that is somebody from our side calling them first or whether it’s simply appointing
who will be our main representative — it may be at some point we need to make a
symbolic gesture.
Michael Pillsbury, a top China adviser to Mr. Trump during his first term, said
Beijing was most likely waiting to see what the deals that the Trump
administration reaches with other nations such as India and Japan look like before
engaging directly.
“They don’t want to start the formal talks because they want to know the bottom
line from others first,” said Mr. Pillsbury, who speaks to U.S. and Chinese officials.
He noted that the trade fight has become a major point of national pride for China
and that it believes that Mr. Trump’s demands — which Beijing does not fully grasp
— will soften as American markets gyrate and midterm elections in the United
States draw closer.
“Delay is very much in their interest, and a speedy deal is very much in Trump’s
interest,” Mr. Pillsbury said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/us-china-trade-tariffs-talks.html
Jason DeParle,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Seeks to End Permanent Supportive Housing for the Chronically Homeless,"While President Trump’s budget proposal seeks significant cuts in spending on
homelessness programs, its larger impact would come from changes in how the
money is spent.
With homelessness at record levels, the plan would increase money for emergency
shelters but end aid for permanent supportive housing, the focus of a decades-long
movement to serve society’s most vulnerable.
More than 300,000 people live in such housing, all chronically homeless and
disabled. Many are veterans. Critics warn that the change would not only forestall
the expansion of the permanent housing stock but force evictions of those it
currently helps, who rely on the deep subsidies that the budget eliminates.
“This is counter to the stated goal of reducing street homelessness, because it’s
putting people back on the streets,” said Barbara Poppe, a consultant to local
governments who worked on homelessness issues in the Obama administration.
The Trump proposal would abolish two programs that finance long-term housing —
the Continuum of Care Program and Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS
— and move them into the Emergency Solutions Grant Program. That program
finances short-term shelters and housing limited to two years.
The proposed cut of $532 million amounts to a reduction of about 12 percent in
combined spending. But none of the remaining money can be spent on long-term
housing, which supporters see as the most important safety net.
Permanent supportive housing emerged three decades ago as a solution to chronic
homelessness, initially with bipartisan support. Under a philosophy called Housing
First, it provides deeply subsidized housing and offers — but does not require
clients to accept — services for addiction or mental illness.
Proponents say it saves lives by getting chronically homeless people off the streets,
where they die at high rates. But in recent years, some conservatives have called
the approach permissive and said it fails to address the underlying problems many
homeless people face. Some blame it for recent surges in the unhoused population.
Many people come to permanent supportive housing after a decade or more on the
streets. In limiting their housing aid to two years, the Trump plan does not address
the question of what should happen after that.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-homelessness-

Lisa Friedman;Hiroko Tabuchi,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Administration Unveils EPA Overhaul With Shift to Approving New Chemicals,"The Environmental Protection Agency said on Friday that it would disperse
scientists from its independent research office to other divisions where they among
other things will be tasked with approving the use of new chemicals.
Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the changes to the E.P.A. in a video, saying
the agency was “shifting its scientific expertise” to focus on issues he described as
“mission essential.”
Most of the immediate changes will affect the Office of Research and Development,
the E.P.A.’s main research arm that conducts studies on things like the health and
environmental risks of “forever chemicals” in drinking water and the best way to
reduce fine particle pollution in the atmosphere.
An internal document previously reviewed by The New York Times outlined the
Trump administration’s recommendation to eliminate that office, with plans to fire
as many as 1,155 chemists, biologists, toxicologists and other scientists working on
health and environmental research.
Out at the E.P.A.: Independent Scientists. In:
Approving New Chemicals.
That didn’t happen on Friday, but the agency’s new priorities were made clear:
One hundred and thirty jobs will be moved to an office at the agency tasked with
approving new chemicals for use, Mr. Zeldin said. Chemical industry groups have
long complained of a backlog in approvals, which they say is stifling innovation.
At an all-hands staff meeting late Friday, Nancy Beck, a former lobbyist at the
American Chemistry Council who now heads the E.P.A.’s chemicals office, told
stunned scientists that it was “a very exciting time.”
“I encourage everyone throughout the agency to apply for these positions,” she
said.
Trump administration officials indicated that more changes were in store for the
research office. Scientists who were on the call said they were left with the
impression that if they did not move into one of the new areas, their current jobs
might be eliminated.
Also on Friday, the E.P.A. extended a deadline for accepting a deferred resignation
offer to May 9.
“This feels like the Hunger Games,” said one employee of the research office who
spoke on condition of anonymity, for fear of retaliation.
Other scientists will move into the administrator’s office as part of a new Office of
Applied Science and Environmental Solutions, which Mr. Zeldin said would “put
science at the forefront of the agency’s rule making.”
Democrats and environmental activists warned the move would politicize scientific
research.
“This so-called ‘reorganization’ is a thinly veiled attempt to extinguish the agency’s
world-renowned scientific expertise by shuffling scientists to process chemical
reviews for industry,” Representative Chellie Pingree, Democrat of Maine, said in a
statement.
The research office “is intentionally separate from E.P.A.’s policy offices, ensuring
it produces unbiased studies,” said Chitra Kumar, the managing director of the
climate program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group. Moving
the scientists into policy offices “could subject those experts to political influence,
particularly in this administration,” she said.
The changes come amid a major deregulatory drive at the agency. The E.P.A. under
Mr. Zeldin is revising or repealing more than 30 regulations aimed at protecting the
air, water and climate. The administrator also is overseeing an effort to dismantle
the legal underpinning for most climate regulations, known as the endangerment
finding.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-epa-cuts.html
Andrew Duehren,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Republicans Wrestle With Trump’s Demands for Tax Cuts,"It was easy to miss, but last weekend President Trump floated a fundamental
rewrite of the American tax code. In a social media post, and again in remarks to
reporters, Mr. Trump suggested the United States could stop taxing income under
$200,000 and instead rely on revenue from his extensive tariffs.
“It’ll take a little while before we do that, but we’re going to be cutting taxes, and
it’s possible we’ll do a complete tax cut,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Sunday.
“Because I think the tariffs will be enough to cut all of the income tax.”
The idea was news to Republicans on Capitol Hill already in the throes of
translating Mr. Trump’s impulses for cutting taxes into law.
Senator Mike Crapo, a Republican from Idaho who leads the Finance Committee,
said he had not heard from Mr. Trump or his staff about the proposal. “So I just
don’t know what that’s referencing,” he said.
Likewise in the House, where Republicans are preparing to release their first stab
at the tax bill in the coming days. “We aren’t having that discussion at all — it’s
never come up,” Representative Lloyd Smucker, a Republican from Pennsylvania
and a member of the Ways and Means committee, said of not collecting income
taxes on earnings under $200,000.
Even if they take a pass on Mr. Trump’s most recent notion, congressional
Republicans are straining to incorporate several of his previous tax proposals into
the legislation. Those include not taxing tips, overtime pay or Social Security
benefits, three of Mr. Trump’s campaign pledges that the White House has
continued to push in his second term.
House Republicans are planning to include those ideas in their version of the bill,
though their proposals are expected to be narrower than the blanket tax
exemptions Mr. Trump has advertised, according to lawmakers, staff and lobbyists
after the talks. Mr. Trump’s other ideas from the campaign trail, like allowing
Americans to deduct the cost of buying a generator, seem very likely to fall by the
way side.
While Republicans acknowledge they’ll now probably have to pass at least a couple
of Mr. Trump’s tax proposals, some still grouse about them.
“My beef with what’s being proposed right now, there’s no guiding principle other
than, ‘well, this is what President Trump promised on the campaign,’” said Senator
Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin. “I understand the political message
there, but let’s keep our tax code simple. I’d much rather lower the rates and keep
it simple, rather than do another little special carve-out deal.”
As with all of the tax cuts Republicans are considering, a chief concern about Mr.
Trump’s ideas is their cost. Without steps to curb their reach, the cost of the
campaign promises could balloon into the trillions, according to estimates from the
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Republicans are trying to limit how much they add to the deficit with the
legislation, forcing a parallel and politically treacherous negotiation over cuts to
spending on Medicaid and other programs that help low-income Americans. How
far Republicans can cut taxes, and what Mr. Trump’s ideas look like in practice, will
depend on how much in spending Republicans can ultimately agree to cut.
“I want to make sure that we get tax relief for hardworking Americans, which
seems to be the focus of those, but there is a finite amount of money as well,”
Senator Roger Marshall, a Republican from Kansas, said of Mr. Trump’s campaign
promises. “So I think the big debate is: How much money does the House want to
save?”
The leading proposal for not taxing tips — a bill crafted by Senator Ted Cruz,
Republican of Texas, and Representative Vern Buchanan, Republican of Florida —
would take a number of steps to limit the scope of the tax break.
Under their bill, Americans making more than a threshold that rises annually, set
at $160,000 this year, would still have to pay taxes on their tipped income. People
making under that limit would avoid income taxes only on the first $25,000 in tips
they receive, though they would still owe payroll taxes. To prevent all types of
workers from trying to claim the tax break, the bill tasks the Treasury Department
with limiting it to people in industries that traditionally receive tips.
It also excludes gig workers from the tax break. Some companies, including the
food-delivery service DoorDash, are lobbying for lawmakers to expand the tax
break to independent contractors. The company has invited its drivers, who work
as independent contractors rather than traditional employees, to write to members
of Congress about the issue, with nearly 40,000 of them doing so already.
“This is a matter of basic fairness — tips are tips,” Max Rettig, global head of public
policy at DoorDash, said in a statement.
While the details for not taxing tips are up in the air, Republicans expect their bill to
ultimately include limitations similar to what Mr. Cruz and Mr. Buchanan had in
their bill. Lawmakers said they were also trying to make sure the tax exemption
for overtime pay was targeted toward middle-and-low income Americans — and
would not create a gold rush in tax dodging for rich Americans. To hold down costs,
Republicans may approve the tax breaks only for the duration of Mr. Trump’s term.
Mr. Trump’s wish to not tax Social Security benefits is more complicated.
Republicans are using a special procedure called reconciliation to pass the tax
legislation without Democratic support. Reconciliation requires lawmakers to
follow a series of rules, one of which is that bills considered under the process
cannot affect Social Security’s finances.
To work around that prohibition, House Republicans, rather than directly changing
how Social Security benefits are taxed, are preparing to offer a more general tax
break to older Americans. Americans over 65 are already eligible for slightly larger
standard deduction, and Republicans have considered a further expansion.
“If we can do a deduction that erases the tax burden that our seniors pay on their
Social Security income, for people within a certain income threshold, it equates to
the same thing,” said Representative Nicole Malliotakis, a New York Republican
and member of the Ways and Means Committee. “It’s eliminating their tax burden.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/republicans-trump-tax-cuts.html
Zach Montague,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,"Trump’s Order Targeting Law Firm Perkins Coie Is Unconstitutional, Judge Rules","A federal judge ruled on Friday that an executive order President Trump signed in
March targeting the law firm Perkins Coie was unconstitutional and directed the
government not to enforce its terms, which had threatened to upend the firm’s
business.
The ruling was the first time a court had stepped in to permanently bar Mr. Trump
from trying to punish a law firm he opposes politically.
Skipping a trial and moving directly to a final ruling, Judge Beryl A. Howell of the
Federal District Court for the District of Columbia wrote that attempts to bring the
firm to heel under the threat of retaliation amounted to unlawful coercion, and
imperiled its lawyers’ ability to freely practice law.
“No American president has ever before issued executive orders like the one at
issue,” she wrote, adding, “In purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook
as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: ‘The first thing we do, let’s kill all
the lawyers.’”
The lawsuit was the first of four similar cases to reach a resolution. Lawyers
representing the firm had argued that the nature of the president’s order was so
obviously coercive that minimal time was needed to assess its illegality.
They argued, and Judge Howell agreed, that the order clearly violated the First
and Fifth Amendments, denying Perkins Coie and other similarly situated firms
freedom “to think and speak as they wish” and equal protection under the law.
Starting in March, Mr. Trump issued a series of executive orders labeling as
national security risks at least six major firms that had represented political
opponents or whose lawyers were involved in investigations into the president
during his first term.
The orders openly detailed Mr. Trump’s political grievances.
The one targeting Perkins Coie cited its past work with the liberal donor George
Soros, whom conservatives have vilified. A similar order targeting WilmerHale
complained that it had hired Robert S. Mueller III after he retired from his role as
special counsel in the investigation, during Mr. Trump’s first term, into Russia’s
election interference.
As a consequence of that past work, which the orders painted as a threat to the
“national interest,” Mr. Trump directed the government to bar those firms’ lawyers
from federal buildings, suspend active security clearances held by their staff
members and cancel any government contracts that could steer taxpayer funds
their way.
Faced with the prospect of sudden exile, firms began scrambling to broker deals
with the president, agreeing to take on hundreds of millions of dollars of pro bono
legal work in order to duck the punishing terms. Mr. Trump celebrated the
concessions, boasting that he had extracted close to $1 billion in free legal work for
causes he favors, all as penance “for damages that they’ve done.”
But the president’s public browbeating of elite law firms, with the express intent of
winning concessions, came as a boon for the handful of firms that instead opted to
fight back in court.
Lawyers for Perkins Coie and WilmerHale told the judges presiding over their
cases last week to look no further than the case of the Paul Weiss firm for proof of
the White House’s true intentions with the orders.
They noted how the grave concerns about national security and the need for urgent
reviews of security clearances stated in the orders appeared to evaporate the
moment Paul Weiss agreed to cut a deal.
Paul Clement, a lawyer for WilmerHale, told Judge Richard J. Leon in a parallel
hearing that the sudden retraction of the orders against Paul Weiss and others
betrayed Mr. Trump’s real goal, and that the unstated message from the White
House was so blatant it hardly merited discussion.
“The signal this sends to the whole bar is: Watch out. We’re watching. If you’re
litigating against the government or you’re not litigating against the government,
your behavior can be punished,” he said. “And there’s just no way to practice law
under those circumstances.”
Other firms that had been targeted, including Jenner & Block and Susman Godfrey,
have also asked judges in their cases to fast-forward to a decision.
Mr. Clement warned that the deals the White House was cutting undermined the
profession as a whole.
“If I have to stand up here and argue in front of the court today with one eye on
how this is going to be perceived by the executive branch and how that’s going to
influence the interest of my other clients, well, I might as well go sit down,” he said.
“That’s not how you can practice law.”
At the hearing in Perkins’s case, Judge Howell repeatedly asked Richard Lawson, a
lawyer for the government, to speak to an expert opinion filed by J. William
Leonard, a former Defense Department official who worked for decades
overseeing security clearances, and who compared Mr. Trump’s orders with tactics
Senator Joseph R. McCarthy had employed during the Red Scare.
In the opinion on Friday, Judge Howell wrote that the order ultimately “stigmatizes
and penalizes a particular law firm and its employees — from its partners to its
associate attorneys, secretaries and mailroom attendants — due to the firm’s
representation, both in the past and currently, of clients pursuing claims and taking
positions with which the current president disagrees.”
“In a cringe-worthy twist on the theatrical phrase ‘Let’s kill all the lawyers,’” she
added, the order was more specifically, “‘Let’s kill the lawyers I don’t like,’ sending
the clear message: Lawyers must stick to the party line, or else.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-law-firms.html

Mitch Smith;Hamed Aleaziz,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers Is Not Afraid of Trump Administration Immigration Warning,"A dispute over a memo about how Wisconsin state workers should interact with
federal immigration agents escalated this week into sharply worded warnings from
the president’s border czar, Thomas Homan, and the state’s Democratic governor,
Tony Evers.
Mr. Evers and others interpreted comments by Mr. Homan to suggest that he and
other elected officials could face arrest over local immigration policies, leading the
Wisconsin governor to say he was “not afraid” of what he described as “chilling
threats.”
The Wisconsin dispute was the latest chapter in a long-running fight between
President Trump’s administration and Democratic-led cities and states over
whether local officials must cooperate with federal Immigration and Customs
Enforcement agents.
In Wisconsin, Republicans had for days pushed for Mr. Evers to rescind a message
to state employees, issued on April 18 by the state’s Department of Administration.
The single-page memo instructed workers to call a state lawyer if an ICE agent or
other federal official visited their workplace. The memo told state workers to stay

calm and notify their supervisors, to not immediately answer an agent’s questions
and to not give them access to nonpublic areas. Chicago officials issued similar
guidance to city workers earlier this year.
The disagreement over the memo intensified outside the White House on Thursday
when a person who identified himself as being from The Gateway Pundit, a right-
wing website, asked Mr. Homan why the government was not simply arresting
“the leaders who are harboring and shielding” people who should be deported.
Mr. Homan responded, “Wait till you see what’s coming.”
When the reporter followed up by asking specifically about Mr. Evers and the
Wisconsin memo, Mr. Homan expanded on his first response.
“Wait to see what’s coming,” he said, according to video of the exchange posted by
C-SPAN. “I meant what I said: You can not support what we’re doing. And you can
support sanctuary cities if that’s what you want to do. But if you cross that line of
impede-ment, or knowingly harboring and concealing an illegal alien, that is a
felony and we’re treating it as such.”
Thomas Homan, the president’s border czar, spoke last year at the Republican

Mr. Evers responded on Friday with a video message in which he said “a Trump
administration official, in not so many words, apparently threatened to arrest me.”
“I haven’t broken the law,” Mr. Evers said in the video. “I haven’t committed a
crime. And I’ve never encouraged or directed anyone to break any laws or commit
any crimes.”
He added that “these threats represent a concerning trajectory in this country.”
“We now have a federal government that will threaten or arrest an elected official
— or even everyday American citizens — who have broken no laws, committed no
crimes and done nothing wrong,” said Mr. Evers, a former teacher and state
schools superintendent who is serving his second term as governor.
In the video, Mr. Evers also defended the memo and accused his political
opponents of distorting its content and intent.
“The goal of this guidance was simple: to provide clear, consistent instructions to
state employees and ensure they have a lawyer to help them comply with all
federal and state laws,” Mr. Evers said.
When asked by The New York Times on Friday to explain what he meant by his
previous comment about the Wisconsin governor, Mr. Homan said that the Trump
administration would not allow entities to impede immigration enforcement.
“I’m just saying: watch what happens. I mean, D.O.J. is taking a strong stance,” Mr.
Homan said, referring to the Justice Department. “They’re suing sanctuary cities.
We’re going to arrest people who cross that line of harboring and concealing. So if
they cross that line, just see what happens.”
Asked about whether Wisconsin’s new guidance violated the law, Mr. Homan said
he would defer to the Justice Department.
“I can’t answer that question,” he said. “We’ve got to leave that up to the
Department of Justice. They’re the ones to decide if it met that metric. They’re the
ones who decide at what point did it cross the line. I have my personal opinion, but
I’m not going to give you that because I don’t want to get ahead of D.O.J.”
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Evers had faced pressure over the memo from Republican state legislators,
who asked in a letter this week that he “rescind this guidance to avoid future
conflicts between state and federal authorities, to assist our brave men and women
in law enforcement, and to ensure the Trump administration’s goal of deporting
violent illegal immigrants is given the full assistance of the state of Wisconsin.”
Cracking down on jurisdictions that do not proactively cooperate with ICE has
been a priority of Mr. Trump and his appointees since the president returned to
office in January.
The Justice Department sued officials in Illinois and Chicago, arguing that their
laws limiting cooperation with immigration agents are illegal. The top federal
prosecutor in New Jersey said her office was investigating that state’s governor
and attorney general over their immigration policies. And the president has sought
to block funding for cities and counties that do not cooperate with immigration
officials.
Wisconsin, a swing state that Mr. Trump carried last year, has become a focus of
federal immigration policy in recent days. Last week, federal agents arrested a
state judge in Milwaukee who they said steered an undocumented immigrant
through a side door in her courtroom while agents waited to arrest him in a public
hallway.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/wisconsin-governor-tony-evers-homan.html
Minho Kim,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,"Appeals Court Allows Trump to Block Money for Federally Funded Newsrooms, for Now","A federal appeals court in Washington ruled on Thursday night that, for now, the
Trump administration could continue to withhold money from Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks,
federally funded organizations that provide news coverage to countries with
limited press freedoms.
In doing so, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
temporarily reversed parts of two lower-court rulings from last month that stopped
the administration from cutting off funds to the news outlets.
The appeals court kept in effect parts of one lower court ruling, which required that
Trump officials bring back journalists at Voice of America, another federally funded
newsroom, from paid leave and resume its news programming.
Unlike Voice of America, which is a government entity, the other three news outlets
are private nonprofits that have independent hiring authorities but receive nearly
all of their funding from Congress.
The order was an administrative stay, which temporarily blocks a lower-court
ruling until appeals court judges decide on whether to overrule the lower court
order while they reach a final verdict. It is a partial victory for President Trump,
who has accused the newsrooms of spreading anti-American and partisan
propaganda, and sought to dismantle the outlets’ parent agency in charge of
disbursing funds and overseeing their operations.
The ruling will deprive those news organizations of the funding they need for news
programming that around 140 million listeners tune into every week across the
world.
The news outlets have had to scale back their operations since March, when the
Trump administration moved to cut their funding.
They have terminated contracts with freelance journalists, missed payments on
office leases and furloughed employees. Lawyers for Radio Free Europe said it
would cease operations by June without more funds. Radio Free Asia has put most
of its staff on unpaid leave since March.
The funding that the appeals court effectively stopped on Thursday could have
allowed these newsrooms to continue reporting while fighting for their funding in
court.
Before the ruling came down, the Trump administration was scheduled to send
about $15 million to those news organizations by Friday, according to court filings.
That money included $12 million for Radio Free Europe’s April funding, which
Trump officials had withheld for weeks.
In March, the Trump administration terminated the grants for the three news
outlets after Mr. Trump signed an executive order seeking to gut its parent
organization, the U.S. Agency for Global Media.
Kari Lake, a close ally of Mr. Trump whom he hired as special adviser to the media
agency, declared her own workplace “unsalvageable.” She also claimed that the
media agency and its newsrooms were rampant with “waste, fraud and abuse,”
without providing evidence.
But the lower court judge, Royce C. Lamberth, ordered Trump officials to resume
funding, saying Mr. Trump could not unilaterally shut down an organization funded
by Congress.
“In this case,” the judge wrote in his ruling on Tuesday, “it was Congress who
ordained that the monies at issue” should go to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty
in a budget bill that was passed in March. The judge noted that President Trump
signed that bill himself.
“In short: The current Congress and President Trump enacted a law allocating
funds to the plaintiffs,” he concluded.
The appeals court decision to pause Judge Lamberth’s orders “should not be
construed” to mean that its judges had found that the Trump administration had a
better chance at winning the case, the three judges wrote in their ruling.
Two of the three appeals court judges overseeing the case, Gregory G. Katsas and
Neomi Rao, are appointees of Mr. Trump. The third, Cornelia T.L. Pillard, was
appointed by President Barack Obama.
A correction was made on May 2, 2025: An earlier version of this article incorrectly
stated which court ruled that the Trump administration could continue to withhold
money from federally funded newsrooms. It is the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit, not the United States Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-blocks-federal-news-funding.html
Annie Karni,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Former Fetterman Aide Expressed Concern to Doctor About Senator’s Mental Health,"The former chief of staff to Senator John Fetterman, Democrat of Pennsylvania,
was so alarmed with his ex-boss’s erratic behavior last year that he wrote a lengthy
letter to his doctor warning that the senator was spiraling out of control and that
his mental health issues could cost him his life.
“I’m worried that if John stays on his current trajectory he won’t be with us for
much longer,” Adam Jentleson, the former chief of staff, wrote on May 20 to a
doctor who had treated Mr. Fetterman at Walter Reed National Military Medical
Center.
Mr. Fetterman’s behavior, according to former aides who are still connected to his
diminishing circle, is still at times a cause of concern. Other former members of his
staff, speaking on the condition of anonymity, report that their colleagues
sometimes were frightened to be in the senator’s presence, if he was in an amped-
up mood.
They have also long been warned never to get in a car if Mr. Fetterman is behind
the wheel because of his dangerous driving habits. His volatile and concerning
behavior, which aides noticed last year was taking a turn for the worse, has only
increased since the election, people who have spent time with him said. That has
coincided with a period when his politics have become more conservative, as he
has watched his home state of Pennsylvania swing for Mr. Trump.
“He does not see his doctors,” Mr. Jentleson wrote last year to the medical director
who oversaw his 2023 hospitalization for mental health issues. “I am not sure when
he last saw a cardiologist, but I don’t think he’s seen one since he was released. He
long ago ordered us to stop putting regular drop-bys with Dr. Monahan on his
schedule, despite the fact that he had agreed to those as part of the plan.” Dr. Brian
P. Monahan is the Navy doctor who has served for nearly 15 years as the on-site
physician in the Capitol.
Mr. Jentleson’s letter, which was obtained by The New York Times, was first
reported by New York magazine.
What you should know. The Times makes a careful decision any time it uses an
anonymous source. The information the source supplies must be newsworthy and
give readers genuine insight.
Learn more about our process.
Mr. Fetterman said in a statement that “my ACTUAL doctors and my family
affirmed that I’m very well.” He called the New York magazine article a “hit piece”
and suggested that Mr. Jentleson and the author of the article, Ben Terris, were
“best friends” with a joint ax to grind, and that they “sourced anonymous,
disgruntled staffers with lies or distorted half-truths.”
(Mr. Terris revealed in his article that Mr. Jentleson is a personal friend.)
A spokesperson for Mr. Fetterman also raised questions on Friday about Mr.
Jentleson’s motivations for making public a deeply personal letter, given the
stigmas that already exist around mental health issues among men.
Mr. Jentleson declined to respond.
Mr. Fetterman, the first-term senator from Pennsylvania who had a near-fatal
stroke during his campaign, spent six weeks at Walter Reed in 2023 being treated
for clinical depression. When he was released, Mr. Fetterman seemed to have
turned a corner. He began adjusting to his life in the Senate, mixing it up with
reporters and colleagues in the hallways, and looked at it as a unique responsibility
to speak out on mental health issues.

“It’s a burden, but a privilege, too, to talk about it,” he told The New York Times in
an interview in 2023. “It’s also an opportunity to be very bipartisan. Red or blue, if
you have depression, get help, please. Don’t ever, ever, ever harm yourself. Do not
leave behind a blueprint of that.”
The auditory processing issues associated with his stroke also seemed to diminish,
and Mr. Fetterman began to casually converse with people without having to rely
on audio transcription.
As he has adjusted to life as a senator, Mr. Fetterman also grew more conservative,
mostly on Israel, but also on a range of other issues. The senator was the first
Democrat to meet with Mr. Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate after the election and
appeared to think that finding common ground was politically savvy at a moment
when his state was swinging further to the right.
An avid Fox News watcher, Mr. Fetterman even seriously considered voting to
confirm Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a former weekend host on “Fox &
Friends,” according to a former aide. The vote would have signaled a green light to
a cabinet appointee who faced accusations of excessive drinking and abusing
women that made it difficult even for Republican senators to get behind him.
It’s not clear to everyone who has worked closely with him that Mr. Fetterman's
political transformation, or his current challenges, is directly related to the mental
health crisis that first sent him to the hospital two years ago. But in his letter, Mr.
Jentleson describes unstable behavior he says could be a result of the senator’s
failure to follow the medical plan, including taking prescription medications,
outlined then by his doctors.
“John has pushed out everyone who was supposed to help keep him on his
recovery plan,” Mr. Jentleson wrote in the letter to Dr. David Williamson, the
medical director of the neuropsychiatry/traumatic brain injury unit at Walter Reed.
“We do not know if he is taking his meds, and his behavior frequently suggests he
is not.”

He said in the letter that people around Mr. Fetterman often witnessed the
“warning signs” his doctor had warned of, including “conspiratorial thinking,
megalomania (for example, he claims to be the most knowledgeable source on
Israel and Gaza around but his sources are just what he reads in the news — he
declines most briefings and never reads memos); high highs and low lows; long,
rambling, repetitive and self-centered monologues lying in ways that are painfully,
awkwardly obvious to everyone in the room.”
He said Mr. Fetterman spent most of his time scrolling on his phone and
formulating tweets, and that things with his wife, Gisele, were “tense.”
“He engages in risky behavior. He drives recklessly. He also recently bought a
gun,” Mr. Jentleson wrote, noting that purchasing a firearm was a warning sign
that he had been directed to report back to a medical professional.
Gisele Fetterman, in a statement to New York magazine, disputed the claims in Mr.
Jentleson’s letter, accusing him of lying about her husband’s condition.
In recent months, Ms. Fetterman has presented a united front with her husband.
She accompanied him on his visit to Mar-a-Lago after the election, and to a
meeting in Israel last month with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Still, many on his staff remain anxious about working for Mr. Fetterman, whose
mood can change dramatically from one day to the next. His driving remains an
area of particular concern.
The senator has long been known as a reckless driver, sometimes going more than
70 miles per hour in a 30-miles-per-hour zone. Last year, he and his wife, as well as
a 62-year-old woman, were hospitalized after he rear-ended the woman’s car on the
Eisenhower Memorial Highway in western Maryland.
Mr. Fetterman was driving well over the posted speed limit of 70 miles per hour,
according to the police report. Pennsylvania records indicated that Mr. Fetterman
had at least two prior driving infractions in the state in which he was going more
than 20 miles per hour above the speed limit.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/john-fetterman-mental-health.html
Jazmine Ulloa,NYT,1,US,5/1/2025,Family of 8-Year-Old Migrant Girl Who Died in U.S. Custody Seeks $15 Million,"The death of an 8-year-old migrant girl in 2023 while she was in the custody of U.S.
Customs and Border Protection prompted investigations and the removal of the
agency’s chief medical officer. Now, two immigrant rights groups are seeking $15
million in damages on behalf of the girl’s family.
In a wrongful death claim filed with the federal government on Thursday, lawyers
for the family offer the most detailed public account yet of the life and death of the
child, Anadith Danay Reyes Álvarez, and her family’s efforts to obtain answers
about her care in federal custody.
Her death came during a record increase in migration, as the Biden administration
struggled to curb illegal crossings and faced criticism about overcrowded detention
facilities and the treatment of minors. Illegal crossings plunged in the final months
of the Biden administration after a change in asylum policy, and have remained
very low under President Trump. But the Trump administration has made families
with children targets for detention and removal as President Trump seeks to fulfill
a campaign pledge to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.
Family Seeks $15 Million in Death of Migrant
Girl in U.S. Custody
Rochelle Garza, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, one of the groups that
filed the claim, said Anadith’s family wanted to ensure there was accountability and
transparency in Customs and Border Protection facilities, which she described as
“one of the most obscure and opaque types of detention in our American
immigration system.”
“They do not want their daughter to have died in vain,” Ms. Garza said.
Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the
Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment on the
wrongful death claim. After Anadith’s death, Troy Miller, then acting head of the
border agency, requested a review of CBP facilities and made recommendations to
address the medical care issues.
Anadith, a Panamanian national, was diagnosed with sickle cell disease and a heart
condition at a young age. When she was 5, she traveled with her father to Spain for
open-heart surgery and returned to Panama. The family made their way up
through Mexico and sought to cross into the United States in May 2023 in hopes of
providing safety and a better life for their daughter, according to the complaint.
Her parents, who are Honduran, are members of a long-persecuted Afro-
Indigenous population known as Garifuna, and had fled their own country before
their daughter was born. The other immigrant rights group that filed the family’s
legal claim was the Haitian Bridge Alliance, which focuses on serving Black
immigrants.

On May 9, 2023, she, her parents and two siblings were detained alongside other
migrants at the border near Brownsville, Texas. The family was then taken to a
processing center in Donna, a nearby city, where security camera footage showed
her parents handed over their daughter’s medical records to border officials in a
medical screening area, the claim states. But medical personnel there did not
properly assess her medical history or communicate the details of her medical
conditions to the staff at the facility in Harlingen where the family ended up,
investigators have found.
Anadith and her family were held in custody for nine days, more than twice as long
as newly arrived migrants, particularly children, should be detained, according to
the border agency’s own standards. In that time, Anadith exhibited a high fever
and complained of pain in her chest and abdomen, among other symptoms,
lawyers said.
The claim contends immigration officials failed to provide the girl with proper
medical care and to adhere to a 22-year-old consent decree that lays out the
minimum standards for care of the nation’s youngest new arrivals. Between the
evening of May 14 and her death on May 17, an internal investigation found,
medical professionals at the holding facility in Harlingen saw Anadith at least nine
times. A nurse practitioner who saw the child told internal investigators that she
dismissed three or four requests from Anadith’s mother to call an ambulance or
take the child to the hospital.
The previous year, a report from the detention ombudsman at Homeland Security
had warned that critical shortages in medical services at border facilities could put
migrants’ lives at risk. A report from the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this
year found the circumstances of Anadith’s death were “not an aberration, but
indicative of systemic problems” within border facilities and medical care.
Anadith’s family is now in the process of seeking asylum, and her parents have
secured work permits, lawyers said.
In an interview on Thursday, the girl’s mother, Mabel Álvarez, said her family had
filed the claim in hopes of preserving Anadith’s memory and preventing another
tragedy. She recalled that her daughter was healthy when she first arrived at the
South Texas border. But she said the small room where her family was detained
was filthy with trash and dust. She also recalled it was frigid, the reason such
facilities are often referred to as “hieleras,” or coolers.
Ms. Álvarez wept as she described staff members who she said ignored her pleas
for medical attention as her daughter’s condition worsened. After the family’s
release from immigration detention, Ms. Álvarez said, she took on a job at a factory
in New York, but she had to leave it as she struggled with depression and anxiety.
“It was a difficult thing, that my daughter died in my arms, looking for help,” she
said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/migrant-girl-death-cbp-damages.html
Isabella Kwai;Julian E. Barnes;David E. Sanger,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Waltz’s Use of Messaging Platform Raises New Security Questions,"Michael Waltz got himself in trouble with the White House when, as national
security adviser, he inadvertently added a journalist to a sensitive chat on Signal, a
commercial messaging app.
Now, as he leaves that job, he has raised a new set of questions about White House
use of the encrypted app. A photograph of him looking at his phone on Wednesday
during a cabinet meeting makes it clear that he is communicating with his
colleagues — including the secretary of state and the director of national
intelligence — using a platform originally designed by an Israeli company that
collects and stores Signal messages.
This discovery of the new system came when a Reuters photographer, standing
just over Mr. Waltz’s left shoulder, snapped a photo of him checking his phone.
He was not using a privacy screen, and when zoomed in, the photo shows a list of
messages and calls from several senior officials, including Vice President JD Vance
and Steve Witkoff, the special envoy who is negotiating on three fronts: the Israel-
Hamas talks, the increasingly tense dance with Vladimir V. Putin about Ukraine
and the Iran nuclear talks. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Tulsi Gabbard, the
director of national intelligence, are also on his chat list.
While the app that Mr. Waltz was seen using on Wednesday looks similar to Signal,
it is actually a different platform from a company that advertises it as a way to
archive messages for record-keeping purposes. That is critical, because one
concern that came up when senior officials were using the app was whether it
complied with federal record-keeping rules.
One of Signal’s benefits is that it is both encrypted and can be set to automatically
delete messages. But while that is a feature for users seeking secure
communications, it is a problem for the National Archives, as it seeks to retain
records.
It is not clear if Mr. Waltz began using the alternative app when he became national
security adviser or after a nonprofit watchdog group, American Oversight, sued the
government for failing to comply with records laws by using Signal.
While the real version of Signal gets constant security updates and messages are
kept encrypted until they reach a user’s phone, security experts question how
secure the alternative app is.
“This is incredibly dumb,” said Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who is a
longtime member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “The government has no
reason to use a counterfeit Signal knockoff that raises obvious counterintelligence
concerns.”
Cybersecurity experts said the platform that Mr. Waltz was using is known as
TeleMessage, which retains copies of messages, a way of complying with the
government rules. The screen in the photograph shows a request for him to verify
his “TM SGNL PIN.” Time stamps indicate that the communications were as recent
as the morning of the cabinet meeting.
TeleMessage, founded in Israel, was purchased last year by Smarsh, a company
based in Portland, Ore.
The TeleMessage platform accepts messages sent through Signal, and captures
and archives them.
Security experts said the use of the TeleMessage raised a number of questions.
Some said it appeared that the company had in the past routed information
through Israel, which is renowned for its electronic spying skills.
But a Smarsh representative said data from American clients did not leave the
United States. Tom Padgett, the president of Smarsh’s enterprise business, said the
collected information was not routed through any mechanism that “could
potentially violate our data residency commitments to our customers.”
Mr. Padgett also said the information was not decrypted while being collected for
record-keeping purposes or moved to its final archive. Security experts said that
whenever information is de-encrypted, security vulnerabilities could be
introduced. “We do not de-encrypt,” Mr. Padgett said.
Smarsh representatives took issue with the idea that their platform was a modified
version of the Signal app. They said their platform simply allowed financial
institutions and governments to capture communications on various channels to
comply with record-keeping regulations.
But cybersecurity officials said questions remained about how the TeleMessage
platform worked, and what vulnerabilities it could introduce into Signal
communications.
Signal is built on open-source code, which allows other organizations to make their
own version that uses the same encryption. But Signal Messenger, the company
that makes and controls the app, does not support alternative versions and actively
tries to discourage their use.
The screen of Mr. Waltz’s phone indicated that he had been in conversation with
several top Trump administration officials. Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters
Mr. Waltz’s use of TeleMessage was reported earlier by the publication 404 Media.
According to the publication, the U.S. government contracted with TeleMessage in
December 2024 to archive Signal and WhatsApp messages. Smarsh
representatives said they have worked with the federal government for a decade
but declined to discuss specific contracts.
It is not clear if the U.S. government audited TeleMessage to determine how it
handles the messages and whether it might break or damage the end-to-end
security of Signal. Representatives of the National Security Council staff did not
immediately respond to requests for comment. Smarsh representative said they
allowed security audits.
Mr. Wyden said the U.S. government and the Navy had developed secure
communications tools that comply with record-keeping rules. Using the modified
version of Signal is far less secure, he said.
“Trump and his national security team might as well post American battle plans on
X at this rate,” Mr. Wyden said.
In response to reports of the photo, Steven Cheung, the White House
communications director, said in a social media post that “Signal is an approved
app that is loaded onto our government phones.”
As part of the lawsuit filed by American Oversight, government officials have
submitted statements saying that the Signal messages from the chat Mr. Waltz
created to discuss strikes on the Houthi militia in Yemen are no longer retrievable.
Chioma Chukwu, the interim executive director of American Oversight, said she
had concerns about the use of the modified app.
“The use of a modified Signal app may suggest an attempt to appear compliant
with federal record-keeping laws, but it actually underscores a dangerous reliance
on unofficial tools that threaten national security and put our service members at
risk,” she said. “Americans have a right to transparency and to know their leaders
are following the law, not hiding behind unauthorized workarounds.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/mike-waltz-signal-photo.html
Stephanie Saul;Alan Blinder,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Harvard Hires Conservative Lawyers to Fight Trump Administration,"A former Texas solicitor general who argued in favor of abortion restrictions. Two
former clerks to Justice Clarence Thomas, one of the Supreme Court’s most
conservative members. And a one-time adviser to the Trump Organization.
These are a few of the conservative legal heavyweights Harvard University has
hired to win a lawsuit against the Trump administration.
The A-list squadron of Republican-aligned lawyers is a departure from the last time
Harvard faced a headline-seizing legal fight. Back then, in 2022, Harvard was
defending affirmative action and turned to a firm long associated with the
university, WilmerHale.
But the Trump administration has scrambled the legal landscape.
Now WilmerHale is under attack by the administration itself and is fighting its own
battle. And Harvard is facing down a fundamental threat after refusing a list of
administration demands that included eliminating professors “more committed to
Harvard’s Trick for Fighting Trump? A Deep
Bench of Conservative Lawyers.
activism than scholarship” and banning international students who oppose
“American values.”
Unlike last time, it has billions of dollars in federal funds on the line if it loses.
Legal observers have said that Harvard stands a good chance of winning on the
legal merits. Although the case could face headwinds if it reaches the Supreme
Court, the roster of conservative-aligned lawyers was designed to give the
university a boost in front of a court with a supermajority of Republican-appointed
justices.
“This fits with a long tradition of clients trying to signal to the Supreme Court
through the counsel that they hire that this is not Harvard liberal versus
conservative administration,” said Aaron Tang, a law professor at the University of
California, Davis. “This is academic freedom. It ought to appeal to someone across
the political spectrum.”
Lee C. Bollinger spoke during a graduation ceremony at Columbia University in 2017.
Seth Wenig/Associated Press
Lee C. Bollinger, a former president of the University of Michigan, said he had used
the same strategy when choosing a lawyer to argue an affirmative action case
before the Supreme Court in 2003.
“I understand exactly what Harvard is thinking in employing these lawyers,” he
said.
The Supreme Court’s swing vote at the time was Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, a
Reagan appointee. Michigan chose as its lawyer Maureen E. Mahoney, who had
served as a clerk for William H. Rehnquist, a Republican appointee who was chief
justice when the Supreme Court heard the case.
“I knew that Sandra Day O’Connor was likely to be the critical vote, and I wanted
somebody who would really understand how she thought and how she might think
about this case,” Mr. Bollinger, who subsequently became Columbia University’s
president, said in a telephone interview.
The strategy worked. The Supreme Court ruled in Michigan’s favor.
Harvard did not comment for this article. Its case against the government argues
that the Trump administration orders violate the First Amendment in several ways.
The university’s arguments also rely on a more arcane law, the Administrative
Procedure Act, which drives the process for federal agencies to develop rules and
impose penalties. The university said the government had ignored its own
requirements in order to cut federal funds.
In a social media post on Friday, President Trump said the government would be
“taking away” Harvard’s tax-exempt status. Such a move, if the administration
ultimately carries it out, could lead to another legal challenge.
For now, Justin Driver, a professor at Yale Law School who clerked for Justice
O’Connor, said Harvard’s roster of lawyers “underscores how deeply fractured the
right is during this fraught moment in our nation’s history.”
And for the lawyers involved, taking on Harvard as a client carries some risks. One
of the lawyers, William A. Burck, advised the Trump Organization until recently,
when Mr. Trump moved to fire him because he had agreed to represent Harvard.
Seventeen lawyers have officially registered for Harvard’s team, and there are
most likely others working behind the scenes.
Not all of them are known for being aligned with conservative causes. Joshua S.
Levy, for example, was the U.S. attorney in Boston for part of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s
presidency. He is now a partner in the firm Ropes & Gray. (Harvard still works with
WilmerHale on other matters.)
But Mr. Burck, a partner in the firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, is a Yale
Law graduate who clerked for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a Reagan appointee
who retired in 2018. Mr. Burck had also served as a deputy to Justice Brett M.
Kavanaugh in the George W. Bush White House and was once castigated by
Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, as a Republican partisan warrior.
At least seven other lawyers in the group have clerked for Republican-appointed
Supreme Court justices, including four sitting justices, before or during their
tenures in Washington.
In addition to Mr. Burck’s firm, at least three other firms are working on Harvard’s
case, including Lehotsky Keller Cohn. Steven P. Lehotsky, a Harvard Law graduate
who clerked for former Justice Antonin Scalia, worked in the Justice’s
Department’s Office of Legal Counsel during Mr. Bush’s administration and had a
central role in building Harvard’s legal team, according to a person familiar with
the strategy who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private
conversations.
Mr. Lehotsky, who was among the lawyers who appeared on Harvard’s behalf in
court on Monday for a conference in the case, did not respond to emails.

Madeleine Ngo,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Temu Stops Shipping Products From China to U.S. Customers as Trump Closes Tariff Loophole,"Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has stopped shipping products from
China directly to customers in the United States, a spokesperson for the company
said on Friday. Instead, all of its U.S. orders will be shipped from local warehouses
in America.
The change comes as the Trump administration closed a loophole that allowed
products made in China and worth no more than $800 to enter the United States
without import fees. The exemption, which President Trump has called a “big
scam” that hurt American small businesses, ended Friday.
Temu said last month that it would adjust its prices after Mr. Trump announced his
intention to close the loophole, known as the de minimis exemption. Last week, the
company started tacking on import charges for U.S. customers who wanted to buy

items from China. In some cases, that more than doubled the price of their
purchases.
In the past few days, some shoppers noticed that many products from China were
removed from Temu’s site, leaving only items that were shipped from local
warehouses.
The company said on Friday that pricing for U.S. consumers “remains unchanged
as the platform transitions to a local fulfillment model.”
“Temu has been actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform,” the
spokesperson said in a statement. “The move is designed to help local merchants
reach more customers and grow their businesses.”
More companies have used the loophole in recent years to ship inexpensive
products directly to U.S. customers without having to pay import fees. Some say
ending the loophole will hurt U.S. consumers by raising prices as well as
companies that had built their businesses around the exemption.
Others, including trade groups representing American textile makers, opposed the
loophole. Kim Glas, the president of the National Council of Textile Organizations,
said the exemption had allowed “unsafe and illegal Chinese goods” to flood the U.S.
market duty-free for years.
“Today’s action by the administration is an important step forward to help
rebalance the playing field for American manufacturers,” Ms. Glas said in a
statement.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/temu-shipping-china-tariffs.html
Julian E. Barnes,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,C.I.A. Fires Top Doctor Targeted by Far-Right Activist,"The C.I.A. fired its top doctor after she was targeted by far-right activists who have
worked to oust government officials they see as disloyal, according to a lawsuit
filed Friday evening.
Late last year, the C.I.A. recruited the doctor, Terry Adirim, to take a top medical
job as the director of the agency’s Center for Global Health Services. Within days,
Ivan Raiklin, a far-right provocateur, accused her of being the “architect” of the
Pentagon’s Covid-19 vaccine mandate.
Dr. Adirim, 61, had served in a top medical role in the Defense Department in 2021
when Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III mandated that all service members
receive a Covid vaccination.
Mr. Raiklin, who has called himself President Trump’s “secretary of retribution,” is
a former Green Beret who became an intense critic of the Covid vaccine. He
published a “Deep State Target List” of 350 individuals he accused of treason.
According to the suit, Mr. Raiklin also singled out Dr. Adirim for criticism.
Appearing on Rosanne Barr’s podcast, Mr. Raiklin accused Dr. Adirim of “genocide
and mass mutilation” for her support of the vaccine.
In a since-deleted post on social media directed at John Ratcliffe, who had been
chosen by Mr. Trump to lead the agency, Mr. Raiklin suggested that Dr. Adirim was
“burrowing in” at the agency, a term for political appointees taking civil service
jobs.
Mr. Raiklin is a close associate of Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national
security adviser, and serves on the board of directors of Mr. Flynn’s organization
America’s Future.
Dr. Adirim was told on April 4 that she was going to be fired. She twice asked why,
but her supervisor said “I have no information.” Breitbart News reported her
termination on April 8 in a social media message, which Mr. Raiklin reposted.
According to the lawsuit, Dr. Adirim was fired two days after Lara Loomer, a far-
right conspiracy theorist, visited the White House and demanded that several
national security officials be dismissed. Ms. Loomer later took credit for the firing
of Gen. Timothy Haugh, the director of the National Security Agency.
In the suit, Kevin Carroll, a lawyer for Dr. Adirim, said he would seek to prove
through discovery that Mr. Raiklin asked Ms. Loomer to request that Dr. Adirim be
fired.
The suit has no direct evidence Mr. Raiklin spoke to Ms. Loomer, but says he had
posted his support for her after the Oval Office meeting. “For the record, I respect
Laura Loomer,” he wrote.
Mr. Raiklin and Ms. Loomer did not respond to requests for comment on Friday
afternoon.
Dr. Adirim’s firing is expected to be finalized Saturday, a month short of when she
would have qualified for full federal retirement benefits, according to the lawsuit.
“Plaintiff and her family suffered terrible injustice only because her good service to
our country made her a target for a political extremist who defamed her and called
for the termination of her employment and even her death,” Mr. Carroll wrote in his
complaint.
The lawsuit says while serving at the Pentagon, Dr. Adirim recommended to Mr.
Austin that service members be given mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations, and notes
it was in the tradition set by George Washington, who ordered the Continental
Army vaccinated for smallpox in 1777.
“Plaintiff’s good advice saved the lives of American service members,” Mr. Carroll
wrote in the complaint. “While several troops sadly died of Covid-19 in the early
days of the pandemic in 2020-1, none died of Covid-19 after Secretary Austin
adopted her recommendation and ordered our armed forces vaccinated.”
On Dec. 11, Dr. Adirim signed a renewable five-year contract with the C.I.A.
When the agency told her on April 4 that she was being let go, an official also said a
clause in her contract allows termination with 30 days’ notice for “any reason.”
A spokeswoman for the C.I.A. declined to comment.
C.I.A. regulations give the director broad authority to fire employees. But a federal
court has issued a temporary stay on Mr. Ratcliffe’s attempts to fire C.I.A. officers

Michael Crowley,NYT,1,US,5/1/2025,How Zelensky Maneuvered Himself Out of the Doghouse With Trump,"Feb. 28 was one of the darkest days for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion three years
earlier. An Oval Office visit by President Volodymyr Zelensky meant to win favor
with President Trump turned into a televised shouting match, prompting Mr.
Trump to banish his guest from the White House without even serving him a
planned lunch.
Mr. Trump was already a deep skeptic of U.S. support for Ukraine. But after the
disastrous meeting with Mr. Zelensky, he accelerated his diplomacy with President
Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, drafting a peace plan to end the war in Ukraine that
offered major concessions to Moscow. Ukraine’s supporters were in panic.
But there is new hope in Kyiv.
A day after the Trump administration announced an economic deal with Ukraine
that gives the United States a stake in its future mineral revenues, analysts say the
country’s prospects look brighter than they have in months.

“These are very good signs that something might be shifting,” said Alina
Polyakova, the president and chief executive of the Center for European Policy
Analysis.
“It does seem like there’s change from the previous approach” by the Trump
administration, she said, calling the minerals deal “a win-win for both sides” that
Ukraine negotiated “very savvily.”
Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky also appeared to have a friendly meeting on Saturday
at the Vatican, as Mr. Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Mr. Putin’s
demands in the separate talks to settle the war.
Analysts cautioned against drawing firm conclusions about Mr. Trump’s intentions
toward Ukraine, however. The president’s zigzagging approach has confounded
observers as he veers between tactics and shifts blame from one side to another
and back again.
Adding to the confusion are sharp differences among Mr. Trump’s aides and
advisers about the right approach. Mr. Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who
has met with Mr. Putin four times, speaks in terms sympathetic to — and
sometimes in close harmony with — Kremlin talking points. Secretary of State
Marco Rubio, by contrast, was a vociferous critic of Mr. Putin during his Senate
tenure and has struck a more skeptical tone.
The chaotic approach underscores the folly of Mr. Trump’s claim as a candidate last
year that he could somehow settle the conflict in just 24 hours. This week he
reached 100 days in office without even a temporary cease-fire to show for his
persistent efforts — a subject of obvious irritation for Mr. Trump.
“The president tends to want to get results quickly, and this has been a very
frustrating process,” Ms. Polyakova said.
At the moment, Mr. Trump’s frustration appears to have shifted from Mr. Zelensky
to Mr. Putin.
The Russian leader has welcomed Mr. Trump’s diplomacy and talk of a
transformed U.S.-Russia relationship. But on the matter of ending the war he
began, Mr. Putin has dragged his feet. Many analysts say Mr. Putin believes he has
the upper hand in the conflict and has little motivation to end the fighting without
even more concessions than Mr. Trump has offered him.
Mr. Putin may also have banked on Mr. Trump’s long — and in many ways
continuing — record of giving him what he wants.
But Mr. Putin may be testing the limits of that strategy. In recent weeks Mr. Trump
has leveled sharp criticism at a Russian leader he has sometimes contorted himself
to avoid offending. “Vladimir, STOP!” Mr. Trump wrote on social media last week
after a particularly deadly Russian missile attack on Kyiv. “Let’s get the Peace Deal
DONE!”
Mr. Trump has increasingly criticized President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, including

Now Mr. Trump faces critical decision points that could help decide Ukraine’s fate.
His choices are especially hard, analysts say, because Mr. Trump’s desire for a
quick peace is in tension with his innate mistrust of Mr. Zelensky and his
admiration for Mr. Putin.
The first big choice Mr. Trump faces is whether to challenge Mr. Putin. The Russian
leader’s demands for a peace agreement include things that Mr. Zelensky could
never sell to his people, such as recognition of Russian control over five occupied
Ukrainian regions and an end to Western military support for Ukraine. While Mr.
Trump has shown a willingness to make big concessions to Mr. Putin, including by
recognizing Russian control over the Crimean Peninsula that Moscow forcibly
annexed in 2014, he has indicated that Mr. Putin is asking too much.
After another recent Russian missile barrage into civilian areas, Mr. Trump wrote
on social media on Saturday of Mr. Putin that “maybe he doesn’t want to stop the
war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently.”
Mr. Trump even threatened to escalate U.S. economic pressure on Russia, including
by introducing “secondary” sanctions that would penalize countries that trade with
Moscow. (Targets could include China and India, which have increased their
purchases of Russian oil in recent years.)
Mr. Trump’s “irritation and impatience and even frustration with Putin is way up,”
said William B. Taylor Jr., who served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to
2009.
Mr. Trump may now be less “star-struck” by the Russian leader than he was in his
first term, Mr. Taylor said, and therefore more willing to challenge him.
“I think Trump is in a stronger position now vis-à-vis Putin than he was in his first
term. Putin is diminished,” Mr. Taylor said. He added: “He’s now the junior partner
to the Chinese. His economy is in very bad shape.” (Mr. Taylor also served as the
senior U.S. diplomat in Kyiv during Mr. Trump’s first term.)
Mr. Trump has sought Mr. Putin’s favor for years, publicly excusing his military
aggression. Doug Mills/The New York Times
A close Trump ally in Congress, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, says
he will soon have a veto-proof majority for a bill to impose new sanctions on Russia
and tariffs on consumers of its energy resources.
As Mr. Putin loses favor, Mr. Zelensky appears to have maneuvered himself out of
the doghouse.
One Ukraine expert added that European leaders, notably including Prime
Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France,
served as “marriage counselors” between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky.
The progress was visible in the impromptu private meeting the men held on the
sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral at the Vatican last weekend, during which they
sat almost knee to knee in a marble rotunda, looking intent but not hostile.
While neither made public the details of their chat, both sides depicted the 15-
minute session as positive, and Ukrainians were buoyed to see Mr. Trump
condemn Russia’s latest attacks on Ukraine shortly afterward.
Analysts also said that Mr. Zelensky successfully negotiated a much better
minerals deal than the one originally presented to his government in February,
which critics called tantamount to extortion.
Mr. Zelensky’s government hopes that, by playing to Mr. Trump’s powerful profit
motive, the minerals deal will give him a new interest in Ukraine’s survival.
Ukraine’s gains on that agreement may portend well for peace talks, said Nataliia
Shapoval, the head of the KSE Institute, a prominent Kyiv think tank. “In the rules
of the game of the Trump team, Ukraine proved itself worthy of negotiations,” she
said.
Still, many Ukraine supporters are tempering their hopes. Mr. Trump has sought
Mr. Putin’s favor for years, publicly excusing his military aggression and even
rejecting widespread charges that Mr. Putin is complicit in corruption, murder and
war crimes.
Should he shy from confronting the Russian leader, Mr. Trump will have another
big decision to make. Vice President JD Vance recently warned that the United
States might “walk away” if the peace negotiations do not progress soon, and Mr.
Trump said in mid-April that he might say, “we’re going to just take a pass.”
It is unclear what that would mean. In a worst-case scenario for Ukraine, Mr.
Trump would declare an end to U.S. aid for Kyiv and give Mr. Putin a green light to
escalate his offensive.
But that presents Mr. Trump with the risk of “losing” Ukraine in what would be a
bloody and chaotic military disaster, one that could dwarf the chaos of the 2021 U.S.
exit from Afghanistan that Mr. Trump calls a national humiliation.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia-zelensky.html
Michael C. Bender,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Funds for K-12 Students Are on the Chopping Block in Trump’s Budget,"President Trump’s budget proposal would shrink the Education Department, which
he has called on Congress to eliminate, by slashing its funding by 15 percent, or $12
billion.
The most significant chunk of that reduction, about $4.5 billion, would come from
K-12 schools. The administration said this reduction would come from a plan to
provide “streamlined, flexible funding to the states” and relieve the federal
government of the responsibility of administering the money and enforcing
compliance. These cuts would not impact Title I funding for low-income schools, an
Education Department spokeswoman said.
Mr. Trump would save $1.6 billion by cutting programs aimed at supporting low-
income students and preparing them for college. The administration said these
programs, known at TRIO and GEAR UP, were “a relic of the past” because access
to college was not “the obstacle it was for students of limited means.”
Other significant cuts come from slashing nearly $1 billion from federal work-study
programs; $910 million from a program for college students with exceptional
financial need; $890 million from services to help immigrant students become
proficient English speakers; $729 million from adult education services; and $315
million from preschool development grants.
The budget proposal also would cut $64 million in funding for Howard University,
the nation’s only federally chartered historically Black college and university.
One corner of the education budget that the Trump administration would like to
boost is charter schools. His budget proposal would increase federal support for
new charter schools by $60 million, or about 8.3 percent.
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the
proposal “cuts much of what helps poor, working-class and middle-class Americans
get ahead.”
“Our concern when the president started dismantling the Department of Education
was not the bureaucracy, but the funding,” Ms. Weingarten said. “And now we
know, he’s actually shortchanging kids. He would gut K-12 programs by $5.4 billion.
Support for student aid is slashed.”
Linda McMahon, the education secretary, said the budget proposal reflected her
mandate to “serve as the final secretary of education.” Closing the Education
Department would require approval from Congress, which has been opposed to
such a move.
“President Trump’s proposed budget puts students and parents above the
bureaucracy,” Ms. McMahon said in a statement. “The federal government has
invested trillions of taxpayer dollars into an education system that is not driving
improved student outcomes. We must change course and reorient taxpayer dollars
toward proven programs that generate results for American students.”
A correction was made on May 2, 2025: An earlier version of this article misstated
where some of the cuts outlined in the government’s budget came from. The most
significant reductions would come from K-12 schools, but not schools designated as
Title I.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-budget-education-cuts.html
Juliet Macur;Jazmine Ulloa;Annie Correal;Kirsten Noyes;Alan Feuer;Dan Barry,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Kilmar Abrego Garcia: The Story of the ‘Mistakenly Deported Maryland Man’,"Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, all of 16, called his older brother in distant
Maryland with startling news. He had made it to the Texas border. He had escaped.
In his family’s telling, this is how his American journey began. They say that for
years in El Salvador, a gang called Barrio 18 had terrorized them, extorting money
from the mother’s small tortilla and pupusa business, threatening to leave them all
dead in a ditch — and targeting young Kilmar, in and out of school, with increasing
menace.
“‘They will appear in black bags,’” his mother said through tears, recalling phone
messages from the gang. “Those were the words they would say.”
Seeing a dim future, the teenager had slipped away to follow the worn, treacherous
path known to so many other migrants before him, including his older brother.
North, across desert and river, into Mexico, and then into the United States.
Over the next dozen years, Mr. Abrego Garcia would call Maryland his home. He
would work in construction. Marry. Help to raise three children, all with special
needs. He would also be repeatedly accused by his wife of verbal and physical
abuse — and be labeled as a gang member by the president of the United States.
The Story of the ‘Mistakenly
Deported Maryland Man’
On March 15, the tumultuous American journey of Mr. Abrego Garcia returned him
to South Texas, in restraints. There, on the tarmac of Harlingen Airport, loomed
three large airplanes bound for El Salvador.
Two were reserved for undocumented immigrants being deported without the
constitutional right to due process, on the allegation that they belonged to a well-
known Venezuelan gang. The third plane was for dozens of other immigrants who,
according to the government, had at least been given the chance to argue their
case in a hearing.
Whatever their past, all the detainees — more than 260 — were being sent by the
Trump administration to a Salvadoran maximum-security prison notorious for its
inhumane conditions.
While captors and captives waited for takeoff, some names fell from the third
plane’s manifest for various reasons, and Mr. Abrego Garcia’s name was added.
This was a mistake — a perverse upgrade.
Six years earlier, a federal immigration judge had expressly prohibited the
government from returning Mr. Abrego Garcia to his native El Salvador, where
gang activity might still pose a threat to his life. Yet here he was, in a Kafkaesque
twist, being sent back in chains to that very country.
The reason: the Trump administration’s assertion that he was part of a Salvadoran-
American criminal gang called MS-13 — an assertion based partly on his clothes
and tattoos.
The New York Times conducted nearly two dozen interviews in Maryland and El
Salvador, and reviewed court documents and recordings in several jurisdictions, to
construct a fuller portrait of Mr. Abrego Garcia. A sheet metal worker with no
criminal record but brushes with law enforcement, he has become an avatar for
both sides of a roiling American debate: those who support the lengths taken by
President Trump to crack down on illegal immigration; and those who believe his
efforts amount to cruel and Constitution-defying overreach.
Whether Mr. Abrego is an MS-13 gang member — as, with equal vehemence, the
Trump administration insists and his family denies — remains unclear.
“Perhaps, but perhaps not,” wrote Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a conservative
jurist on a federal appeals court in Virginia, pondering whether Mr. Abrego Garcia
was a gang member.
“Regardless, he is still entitled to due process.”
On the tarmac in Harlingen, an Airbus A320 began to hum and whine. Just three
days earlier, Mr. Abrego Garcia was driving in suburban Maryland, his 5-year-old
disabled son secure in a car seat in the back, when an officer pulled him over for
what seemed like a routine traffic stop.
Now he was the one restrained in a seat, on an airplane separating from American
soil as the sun began to set in the clear Texas sky.
El Salvador to Home Depot
Mr. Abrego Garcia spent most of his childhood in Los Nogales, a working-class neighborhood on the edge

The working-class neighborhood of Los Nogales, on the hilly edge of San Salvador,
is modest but inviting, the vibrant colors of its cinder-block homes heightened by
bougainvillea and lush gardens of potted plants. It was here that Mr. Abrego Garcia
lost the puckishness of boyhood to the constant threat of gang violence.
He was born in 1995 to Armando Abrego, a former soldier and police officer who
drove a taxi, and Cecilia Garcia de Abrego, who sold homemade tortillas and
pupusas — thick, stuffed flatbreads — from the garage of their narrow, two-
bedroom home. Neighbors remember Kilmar, the youngest of the couple’s four
children, as a soccer-loving scamp who enjoyed stirring things up: ringing
doorbells and running away, talking fresh to elders, getting into scraps.
“Honestly, yes, he was very mischievous,” recalled a close childhood friend named
Carlos, who asked that his full name not be used for fears about his safety. “But it
was never like — I mean, whether he did things with good or bad intentions, I
couldn’t really say. But I do know he liked to play pranks and that he liked to stir up
trouble.”
The friend’s mother, who also asked that her name be withheld for safety reasons,
said that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s antics sometimes went too far, prompting the parents
of other children to march up to his mother’s tortillería to demand that the child be
reined in.
“He was a restless child,” said Blanca Galdamez, a next-door neighbor. “I consider
him to have been a normal child.”
Mr. Abrego Garcia’s mother agreed. During a recent interview, she smiled when
recalling how he and his siblings helped the family business by buying supplies and
making deliveries. “We sold pupusas four days out of the week and tortillas seven
days a week,” Ms. de Abrego recalled. “He collaborated in that.”
But the rise of criminal gangs had begun to color everyday Salvadoran life, with
the grisly aftermath of their violence vividly portrayed on the nightly news.
Residents of Los Nogales say they were mostly spared, with no graffiti to mark
their neighborhood as the territory of MS-13 or Barrio 18. But schools around the
city, including Kilmar’s, were becoming hotbeds of gang violence.
Cesar Abrego Garcia, Kilmar’s older brother, said he could feel the violence closing
in. He headed north into Mexico and, eventually, the United States.
“It was tough to leave my siblings, my family, to be here alone,” said Cesar, who is
now an American citizen and a licensed electrician in Maryland. “But I believe it
was worth it because I could say that maybe I would even be dead if I had stayed.”
In his phone calls back home, Cesar said, he would hear that Barrio 18 was
extorting money from the family’s pupusa business and targeting his younger
brother.
“They had to disconnect the phone,” he said.
One day in 2011 or 2012, Kilmar began his daunting journey to the United States,
probably with the help of paid smugglers. Before long he made his way to Prince
George’s County in Maryland, joining the ranks of undocumented laborers who, out
of necessity, become jacks-of-all-trades, working in construction, remodeling
homes and repairing air-conditioning systems.
They find these jobs through relatives, or word of mouth, or by mustering at
designated gathering spots — the parking lot, say, of a Home Depot.
Special status granted
From left, Cecilia Garcia de Abrego, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s mother; Cesar Abrego Garcia, his brother; and

By 2016, life had given Jennifer Vasquez a lot to handle. Born and raised in Fairfax,
Va., she was 20 years old, working at a chiropractor’s office, emerging from an
abusive relationship and raising two young children who required a lot of attention
and care. Her 2-year-old daughter had epilepsy, and her 1-year-old son had autism.
Then a friend at work introduced her to a young laborer named Kilmar Abrego
Garcia. It took a couple of years, but finally, in 2018, they had their first date during
their work breaks. They ate lunch in his car, at the construction site where he was
toiling. He opened a bag and pulled out two juice boxes for them — and two
lollipops for her children.
“An instant spark,” she said.
After a few months, they were living together. Recalling how Mr. Abrego Garcia ran
errands, did school pickups and attended to her seizure-prone daughter, Ms.
Vasquez said, “I’ve always said that blood doesn’t define family.”
But this new, cobbled-together family faced challenges. In August 2018, Ms.
Vasquez’s former partner, a construction worker named Edwin Trejo Ramos, filed a
court motion seeking immediate custody of their two children, claiming in part that
they were in danger because she was “dating a gang member.”
A judge deemed the matter not an emergency, and the case was later dismissed, in
early 2019. In November of that year, Mr. Ramos was charged with raping a 13-
year-old girl. He was eventually convicted and sentenced to prison.
Ms. Vasquez learned that she and Mr. Abrego Garcia would be having a child, and
her pregnancy carried high medical risk. With constant appointments and weekly
injections, she said, her partner urged her to rest as much as possible while “he
would do whatever he could to pay our bills.”
That is what Mr. Abrego Garcia was trying to do on March 28, 2019. After driving
his pregnant girlfriend to her job, he stood with three other men in a spot
designated for day laborers outside a Home Depot in the Washington suburb of
Hyattsville, Md., where the sides of trucks in the parking lot say, “Rent Me Starting
at $19.” He was hoping to be hired for the day, motivated in part by the image on his
phone: a sonogram image of his yet-to-be-born child, who he had just learned was
a boy.
A man approached the laborers as they chatted, but he was not a contractor
looking to hire; instead, he was a Hyattsville police officer who thought they were
loitering. Two of the men, neither of them Mr. Abrego Garcia, tossed plastic bottles
containing marijuana under a parked vehicle.
On March 28, 2019, Mr. Abrego Garcia was detained outside a Home Depot in the Washington suburb of

All four men were handcuffed and taken to the Hyattsville station of the Prince
George’s County Police Department for interviews. An officer with experience
investigating gangs identified one man as “Bimbo,” a member of the MS-13 Sailors
clique with an extensive criminal history, and a second man as another gang
member called “Maniaco.” As for the third man, the officers “were unable to
determine his gang affiliation” and “he was sent on his way,” according to a police
report labeled “Gang Field Interview Sheet.”
That left Mr. Abrego Garcia, who was described as 5-foot-7, about 200 pounds, with
short hair and a beard. He wore a Chicago Bulls hat and a hooded sweatshirt with a
depiction of “rolls of money covering the eyes, ears and mouth of the presidents on
the separate denominations.”
The report asserted that the outfit was “indicative of the Hispanic gang culture,”
and that the Bulls hat represented “a member in good standing with the MS-13.” In
addition, it said, a reliable, unnamed source had identified Mr. Abrego Garcia as a
member of MS-13’s Westerns clique who was known as “Chele.”
Mr. Abrego Garcia admitted to being in the United States without proper
documentation, but fiercely denied gang membership; indeed, he had no record
beyond several traffic infractions. What’s more, MS-13’s Westerns clique operates
from the Long Island town of Brentwood, but his lawyers would later say he had
never lived in New York State. As for the sweatshirt, which depicted rolls of money
and the face of Benjamin Franklin — not presidents, as the police report said — Ms.
Vasquez would later say she bought it for her boyfriend after seeing the design on
Fashion Nova, a clothing website.
The report and one of its authors would have other problems. For one, the report
indicated that Mr. Abrego Garcia was being detained in connection with a murder
investigation — a reference made nowhere else and never again. For another, a
gang unit officer involved in the encounter, Ivan Mendez, would be suspended days
later and eventually fired; he would later plead guilty to misconduct after
admitting to providing confidential information to a woman whom he paid for sex.
Ms. Vasquez spent that night panicking, not knowing why Mr. Abrego Garcia
hadn’t collected her from work, not knowing where he was or why his phone was
turned off. But the next morning, he called with an explanation: He was now in the
custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The couple found themselves in the hell of uncertainty. She was dealing with her
risky pregnancy, caring for two children with special needs, trying to keep things
together on one income, working as an advocate for her husband and fearing that
their child would not know his father. And he was behind the curling razor wire of a
detention center about 20 miles from home, struggling to prove that he was not a
gang member.
In late June, three months after Mr. Abrego Garcia’s arrest, a wedding ceremony
was held at a venue not featured in bridal brochures: the Howard County
Detention Center in Jessup, Md. There, separated by a glass partition, Ms. Vasquez
and Mr. Abrego Garcia exchanged vows in the presence of a pastor. Unable to touch
each other, they exchanged rings with the help of a corrections officer.

In August, Ms. Vasquez underwent a C-section. Their boy was born with a
congenital ear deformity and, it would later be determined, was autistic and unable
to speak.
The birth came between immigration court proceedings in which Mr. Abrego
Garcia sought to fight his deportation by requesting a humanitarian exception that
would allow him to remain in the United States, citing the gang harassment of his
family in El Salvador. The government argued he should be denied that bid because
of his suspected gang membership.
Lucia Curiel, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyer at the time, recalled that the government
presented a particularly aggressive case against her client. His hearing lasted two
days over several months, when similar proceedings usually take only a few hours.
Nevertheless, he prevailed, with the immigration judge granting him a special
status, “withholding from removal,” that indefinitely prohibited the government
from deporting him to El Salvador.
“The judge would not have found him credible or granted any relief if he had
believed Kilmar was a gang member,” Ms. Curiel said.
For now, at least, Mr. Abrego Garcia was free to go.
Seeking protective orders
In a storybook world, Mr. Abrego Garcia would simply return to Prince George’s
County, never again to draw the attention of law enforcement. He would blend into
the multiracial fabric of the county, where more than half the residents are African
American and a quarter are Hispanic or Latino. In some neighborhoods, street
vendors set up stands to sell rolled tortilla chips, papas fritas or flavored ices.
But life for Mr. Abrego Garcia continued to be fraught.
Released from detention after seven months, he held his infant son for the first
time, became emotional when he reunited with the two older children and,
gradually, returned to the daily challenges of work and family. But his wife said his
incarceration had changed him.
“Once he came out, maybe like a month after he was out, he changed a lot with me
and my kids, and my other two kids,” Ms. Vasquez told a Maryland judge in 2020.
“Like, he would yell at them and me for anything. Any little thing, it would bother
him.”
He also became short-tempered and violent, according to court documents from
two protective orders sought by his wife, as well as audio recordings of her court
appearances obtained by The Times. One month after Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release,
according to those documents and recordings, he began to physically abuse Ms.
Vasquez, prompting her to fill out paperwork to secure a protective order against
him that December. But, as she told a judge in 2020, she never showed up for court
in that case, testifying that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s family had persuaded her not to
follow through with it.
But the abuse continued into 2020, she said in testimony and in court records. Mr.
Abrego Garcia was kicking her, shoving her, grabbing her hair, slapping her and
making everyone in the house afraid, she said.
Jennifer Vasquez sought a protective order in 2020.
“Also, he breaks, like, everything in the house,” Ms. Vasquez told a district court
judge in August 2020, according to the audio recordings, when the judge asked for
more evidence of the abuse. “That’s the first thing that my son told the officer: ‘Can
you please tell him not to break anything?’”
Ms. Vasquez noted that her husband “does use drugs,” but that he had no access to
firearms.
The judge granted a temporary protective order, ruling that Mr. Abrego Garcia
have no contact with Ms. Vasquez and the children, not abuse or harass them, and
move out of their home until the hearing for the final protective order. The judge
also gave Ms. Vasquez custody of the couple’s 11-month-old son.
Eight days later, Ms. Vasquez filed to rescind the order, saying that Mr. Abrego
Garcia’s family wanted him to be part of their son’s first birthday celebration and
that he had agreed to continue counseling. She did not appear for a subsequent
hearing, held in late September, and her petition for a protective order was
dismissed.
Less than a year later, Ms. Vasquez filled out another request for a protective order
against her husband. In that document, she described an incident in May 2021 in
which Mr. Abrego Garcia punched her and scratched her left eye and, later that
day, tore her clothes off and grabbed her arm so hard he left marks. But a month
later she again failed to appear for a hearing, and the matter was dropped.
When asked last week about her reports of domestic violence several years ago,
Ms. Vasquez said that she and her husband had gone through “a rough patch”
driven by the trauma of his protracted detention, but had overcome that difficult
time through counseling.
“We closed that chapter,” Ms. Vasquez said. “We were mature enough to look for
help.”
Mr. Abrego Garcia’s American life went on. The trepidation known to
undocumented immigrants remained ever-present, the occasional encounters with
law enforcement not at an end.
Ms. Vasquez filled out another request for a protective order against her husband in 2021.
According to records released last month by the Department of Homeland Security,
Mr. Abrego Garcia notified immigration officials in late October 2022 that he
wanted to move to Houston to be closer to his parents. Just five weeks later, he was
driving back to Maryland — with eight passengers — when a highway patrol
officer in Tennessee pulled him over for speeding.
In Homeland Security’s version of the trooper’s account, Mr. Abrego Garcia
explained that he had left Houston three days earlier and was transporting people
in his boss’s car to work in construction in Maryland. But there was no luggage,
and the passengers all gave Mr. Abrego Garcia’s home address as their own —
leading one officer to suspect the possibility of human trafficking.
In the end, Mr. Abrego Garcia was let off with a warning citation for driving with an
expired license.
Back in Maryland, the couple rose most weekdays at 4:30 in the morning. A union
member, he would join his sheet metal crew by 5:30 a.m., all the while hoping that
the five-year apprenticeship program he was in would lead to advancement and
better pay. She would drop the children at school before working the front desk at a
dentistry office. He would pick the children up in the afternoon and help with
homework and activities while she prepared dinner. There were soccer games,
dance practices, weekend takeout dinners and the occasional outing on Cesar
Abrego Garcia’s boat.
Particular care was given to the youngest, nonverbal, child. Because loud noise
would unsettle the boy, Mr. Abrego Garcia did his best to secure doors and
soundproof rooms, his wife said, and he watched YouTube tutorials for tips on how
to keep his family safe.
The drive home
The afternoon of Wednesday, March 12, carried the promise of spring, with few
clouds and a temperature in the mid-60s. Mr. Abrego Garcia was headed home, his
work shift ended, his 5-year-old son in the back seat of his vehicle, secured in a car
seat designed for children with disabilities.
But while he drove along Baltimore Avenue in the Maryland suburb of College
Park, Mr. Abrego Garcia was told to pull over by a law enforcement officer. He
turned into the parking lot of an Ikea and stopped outside a Buffalo Wild Wings
restaurant.
As this was happening, Mr. Abrego Garcia called his wife, who told him to put her
on speaker phone. She heard someone tell him to turn the engine off and step out of
the car. She heard her husband say that he had a son with special needs in the back
seat. She heard the officer hang up her husband’s phone.
Minutes later, someone saying they were with the Department of Homeland
Security called Ms. Vasquez to inform her that she had 10 minutes to collect her
son, or child protective services would be contacted.
She arrived a few minutes later to find her crying 5-year-old still strapped in his
car seat and her husband sitting on a curb, his hands cuffed behind him. He was in
a fluorescent yellow safety shirt that workers wear on construction sites.
The only explanation the distraught Ms. Vasquez received was that her husband’s
“immigration status had changed.”
In the moment, it was unclear why a sheet metal worker with a child in the back
seat of his car had been pulled over and handcuffed. But it came at a time when
federal immigration agents were scrambling under pressure from the White House
to meet one of President Trump’s more audacious political promises: to deport as
many as one million immigrants from the United States in his first year in office.
Mr. Abrego Garcia called his wife that night from a detention center in Baltimore,
and the questions he said he had been asked suggested that immigration agents
had had him in their sights. They asked about his family’s visits to Don Ramon, a
restaurant in Silver Spring that specializes in Mexican and Salvadoran food. They
asked about a photo they had of him playing basketball with others at a local court.
Who were those people?
And they accused him of being in MS-13 — a false, inflammatory allegation, his
wife said, that she and her husband had thought was well behind them.
Due process
Protesters at the U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Md., for a hearing on the deportation of Mr. Abrego

In the days ahead, as outrage grew over the deportation of hundreds to a
Salvadoran prison system notorious for human rights violations, Mr. Abrego Garcia
would be widely referred to in headlines around the world as the “mistakenly
deported Maryland man.” Although much about him remains unknown, he came to
personify the Trump administration’s determination to rid the United States of
illegal immigrants — in part by defying the protection enshrined in the U.S.
Constitution, that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without the
due process of law.
“The judicial process is for Americans,” Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s homeland
security adviser, would say in a social media post. “Immediate deportation is for
illegal aliens.”
The federal government would admit its mistake in deporting Mr. Abrego Garcia,
whose whereabouts in the Salvadoran prison system have become unclear, yet
resist doing much to correct that mistake. Instead, the government would double
down on its assertion that he was a gang member.
Mr. Trump would display a digitally altered photo of Mr. Abrego Garcia’s tattooed
hands as proof. Vice President JD Vance would erroneously call him a convicted
gang member. A top homeland security official would falsely say in a social media
post that he had been “found with rolls of cash and drugs.” Homeland Security
would release what it would call a “bombshell” report on the “Kilmar Abrego
Garcia suspected human trafficking incident” — in reference to the Tennessee
traffic stop.
Ms. Vasquez, meanwhile, would share the devastating effect on their family — how
their youngest child sought comfort in the scent of his absent father’s work shirts
— as their lawyers fought for Mr. Abrego Garcia’s return in various courts.
Ultimately, the Supreme Court would rule that the White House must take steps to
“facilitate” his release from Salvadoran custody.
The White House would stonewall, prompting Paula Xinis, a federal judge in
Maryland, to begin an inquiry into whether the administration had willfully
violated her orders. But she would pause the proceedings at the government’s
request after a cryptic Justice Department filing that referred to “diplomatic
discussions” between the State Department and El Salvador.
Throughout, no one in the Trump administration would seem willing or able to
answer the basic question posed by Judge Wilkinson: “The government has
conceded that Abrego Garcia was wrongly or ‘mistakenly’ deported. Why then
should it not make what was wrong, right?”
All this would transform Mr. Abrego Garcia into a complicated symbol, an
international figure representing the unease and uncertainty in the United States
in 2025.
For now, though, he was just a man sitting on a curb, the afternoon sun on his face.
Handcuffed and crying, he was a mile from his American home, and three days
from being sent in shackles to the home country he thought he had left for good.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/abrego-garcia-mistakenly-deported.html
Jenna Russell,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Here’s What Happened in Karen Read’s Murder Trial This Week,"A cellphone data analyst and a close friend of the victim testified this week in the
high-profile retrial of Karen Read, the Massachusetts woman charged with killing
her boyfriend, a Boston police officer, in January 2022.
The judge in the case declared a mistrial last July when jurors could not agree on a
verdict. The retrial is unfolding in the same courthouse in Dedham, south of
Boston.
Prosecutors say that Ms. Read, 45, intentionally backed her car into Officer John
O’Keefe and killed him after a night out drinking with friends. Defense lawyers
argued in the first trial that after Ms. Read dropped Officer O’Keefe off at a party
late that night in suburban Canton, Mass., at the home of another Boston police
officer, he was beaten and left for dead in the front yard during a raging blizzard.
Ms. Read has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder,
manslaughter while operating under the influence of alcohol, and leaving the scene
of an accident causing death.
The defense contends that she is the victim of a corrupt and incompetent
investigation by law enforcement officials who conspired to frame her for the
murder.
Cellphone data is disputed
A digital forensics expert, Ian Whiffin, testified this week about his analysis of data
from the Officer O’Keefe’s cellphone, which was found beneath his body. Based on
the data, Mr. Whiffin said, he believes that the phone was in the yard of the home
where the party was held from 12:30 a.m. on Jan. 29, when Ms. Read dropped off
Officer O’Keefe there, until 6 a.m. that morning, when his body was discovered in
the snow.
That testimony suggests that the officer did not go inside the house that night,
supporting the prosecution’s argument that Ms. Read hit and killed him with her
car.
But lawyers for Ms. Read challenged Mr. Whiffin’s analysis of the phone data,
questioning whether it was really possible to determine with certainty whether the
phone was on the lawn or a short distance away, inside the house.
Mr. Whiffin also addressed the timing of a hotly contested Google search in the
early hours of Jan. 29, by a friend of Officer O’Keefe and Ms. Read who attended
the party, asking “ho[w] long to die in cold.” He said the online search was not
conducted at 2:27 a.m., as a time stamp indicates, but later that morning, around
when Officer O’Keefe’s body was discovered.
Defense lawyers have maintained that the Google search happened at 2:27 a.m.,
when the friend opened the search window, and that it showed that the people at
the party had conspired to abandon the injured police officer. Officer O’Keefe’s
cause of death was head trauma and hypothermia.
Who is Jennifer McCabe?
Jurors this week heard several days of testimony from Jennifer McCabe, a friend of
Officer O’Keefe and Ms. Read’s who was at the bar with them that night. Ms.
McCabe also attended the house party that followed and was present at 6 a.m. on
Jan. 29, when Ms. Read returned to the home and discovered the body on the lawn.
In her testimony, Ms. McCabe described receiving a hysterical phone call from Ms.
Read around 5 a.m. saying that Officer O’Keefe had never come home the previous
night. She recounted Ms. Read asking, “Did I hit him?”
She drove Ms. Read back to the home in Canton where the party had been held, she
said, and Ms. Read continued to question whether she could have hit Officer
O’Keefe after dropping him off. Ms. Read also showed Ms. McCabe and another
friend a crack in the taillight of her black Lexus S.U.V., Ms. McCabe testified.
Defense lawyers pressed Ms. McCabe on precisely what Ms. Read said that
morning, and whether she had asked, “Did I hit him?” or said, “I hit him.”
Ms. McCabe said in court this week that her memory of Ms. Read saying “I hit him,
I hit him” that morning remains “as fresh today” as it was three years ago.
The couple’s relationship was fraying
In testimony last week, a state police trooper read text messages exchanged by
Ms. Read and Officer O’Keefe the day before he died that revealed growing tension
in their relationship.
“Things haven’t been great between us for a while,” Officer O’Keefe wrote to Ms.
Read. She replied, “So you’re not into it anymore. That’s fine, but I don’t want to
keep trying and have you keep treating me like this.”
A local paramedic who responded to the scene after Officer O’Keefe’s body was
discovered testified that a distraught Ms. Read had expressed despair about
arguing with her boyfriend in their last interaction.
Ms. Read did not testify in her first trial, but her own descriptions of the night her
boyfriend died may be a factor in the retrial. Prosecutors have said they plan to
introduce statements she made in magazine articles and documentaries after the
mistrial last summer.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/karen-read-murder-trial-

Catie Edmondson,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump’s Budget Proposal Falls Flat With Some Key Republicans in Congress,"President Trump’s budget drew harsh criticism on Friday from a trio of powerful
Republican senators, who rejected what they said were woefully inadequate
resources for the military, and suggested they would ignore his plan and ensure
that Congress provided far more money for their priorities.
In separate statements, the senior Republicans — Senators Roger Wicker of
Mississippi, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee; Susan Collins of
Maine, the chairwoman of the appropriations committee; and Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky, the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on defense —
expressed their disdain for Mr. Trump’s proposal.
Their collective pushback amounted to a rare moment of defiance at a time when
Republicans on Capitol Hill have done little to fend off the White House’s efforts to
slash federal programs.
Mr. Wicker said the administration’s proposed military spending levels would
“shred to the bone our military capabilities and our support to service members.”
“President Trump successfully campaigned on a Peace Through Strength agenda,
but his advisers at the Office of Management and Budget were apparently not
listening,” Mr. Wicker said. He said that Mr. Trump’s budget would effectively
flatline military funding for the fifth straight year, “which is a cut in real terms.”
Congressional Republicans are planning on approving roughly $150 billion in new
defense spending through their sprawling tax cuts legislation. It is meant for
specific new projects — not as a general-use boost to the Pentagon’s budget. In
their budget request, administration officials factored in that money, and made the
case that they planned to increase military spending by 13 percent.
Hawkish Republicans on Capitol Hill view that gambit as an accounting gimmick,
and want to see military spending levels raised through the regular appropriations
process.
“Make no mistake: A one-time influx reconciliation spending is not a substitute for
full-year appropriations,” Mr. McConnell said. “It’s a supplement.”
Ms. Collins, who called the budget proposal “late” and lacking in important details,
nonetheless made it clear she did not approve.
After a preliminary review, she said, she had “serious objections” to the defense
portion. And she criticized Mr. Trump’s plan to gut or eliminate domestic programs
including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps to offset
high utility bills for low-income people across the country; another that provides
federal educational services to students from disadvantaged backgrounds; and
others that support biomedical research.
“Ultimately,” she noted in her statement, “it is Congress that holds the power of the
purse.”
Mr. McConnell also noted in his statement that only Congress could set and
approve federal spending levels, and that lawmakers often disregard the numbers
laid out in the president’s budget request.
“America cannot expect our allies to heed calls for greater annual defense spending
if we are unwilling to lead by example,” Mr. McConnell, the former Republican
leader, said. “Fortunately, presidential budget requests are just that: requests.
Congress will soon have an opportunity to ensure that American power — and the
credibility of our commitments — are appropriately resourced. I hope and expect
that my colleagues will join me in placing America’s national security first.”
Many Republicans cheered Mr. Trump’s budget, which Speaker Mike Johnson
called a “bold blueprint that reflects the values of hardworking Americans and the
commitment to American strength and prosperity.”
But the dissent from some Republican lawmakers in both chambers was notable at
a time when few of them have spoken out about any of the president’s moves.
Representative Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, called the cut to the Low
Income Home Energy Assistance Program “reckless,” and said it would leave his
constituents “out in the cold.”
Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the
Armed Services Committee, said he was “very concerned the requested base
budget for defense does not reflect a realistic path to building the military
capability we need to achieve President Trump’s Peace Through Strength agenda.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-budget-congress-republicans.html
Robert D. McFadden,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,"George Ryan, Illinois Governor Who Halted Prison Executions, Dies at 91","George H. Ryan, the Illinois governor who reopened a national debate over capital
punishment in 2000 by imposing a moratorium on death-row executions in his
state, and who later went to prison for taking bribes in an earlier role as the Illinois
secretary of state, died on Friday at his home in Kankakee, Ill. He was 91.
His death was confirmed by his son, George H. Ryan Jr.
Citing “a shameless record of convicting innocent people and putting them on
death row,” Governor Ryan, a moderate Republican who, like most Americans, had
long favored capital punishment, defended his decision to suspend the death
penalty in Illinois on Jan. 31 as an act of conscience.
Barely a year into his single four-year term, Mr. Ryan said that since 1977, when
the Illinois death penalty was reinstated after a federal pause, the state’s capital
punishment system had been rife with grievous error. Of 25 inmates who had been
placed on death row in that time, he said, 12 had been executed but 13 had been
sent there for crimes they did not commit and were later exonerated and released.
“I cannot support a system which in its administration has proved so fraught with
error, and has come so close to the ultimate nightmare, the state’s taking of
innocent life,” he said.
He added, “Until I can be sure that everyone sentenced to death in Illinois is truly
guilty, until I can be sure with moral certainty that no innocent man or woman is
facing a lethal injection, no one will meet that fate.”
The moratorium was hailed by opponents of capital punishment, who said that
wrongful death-penalty cases were common in America, often corrupted by issues
of race, poverty, bad lawyering and police or prosecutorial misconduct.
Contemporary research has suggested that 70 percent of fully reviewed capital
cases contain reversible errors.
But Mr. Ryan’s blanket commutation was questioned by conservative law-and-
order groups and by families and friends of victims slain by people who ultimately
landed on death row. Many said the moratorium amounted to a killers’ reprieve
granted by a governor capriciously overturning settled court decisions.
Mr. Ryan, however, insisted that his moratorium was an act of conscience based on
statistical evidence that people on death row in Illinois — guilty or not — were
likely to be executed. He found himself in a media spotlight, being compared to his
fellow Republican Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who had presided over 135
executions in five years in office and who was running for president at the time.
An editorial in The New York Times, titled “Governor Ryan’s Brave Example,”
said: “Mr. Ryan has made it politically acceptable for conservative Republicans
and Democrats alike to rethink capital punishment and how it is carried out. Many
politicians have avoided the issue for fear of being called soft on crime.”

was re-elected governor and Mr. Ryan was elected lieutenant governor. He would
serve until 1991. Bettmann, via Getty Images
Mr. Ryan was not the first governor to commute death-row sentences. After losing
a 1970 re-election bid, Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller of Arkansas, a Republican,
commuted the sentences of 15 condemned inmates; Gov. Toney Anaya of New
Mexico, a Democrat, commuted five death sentences before leaving office in 1986;
and Gov. Richard F. Celeste of Ohio, also a Democrat, commuted eight death
sentences before departing in 1991. All opposed the death penalty, but none of their
actions compared in scale with Mr. Ryan’s sweep.

Mr. Ryan named a blue-ribbon commission to re-examine cases that had led to
wrongful convictions. It found that some defense lawyers had been less than
competent, that judges had overlooked trial mistakes, and that death penalty
statutes were a hodgepodge of contradictions needing an overhaul. The panel
proposed reforms, including bans on death sentences for the mentally handicapped
as well as in cases based on the testimony of a jailhouse informant or a single
eyewitness.
Mr. Ryan did not seek re-election in 2002. Some political observers linked his
demurral to a series of recent criminal convictions of former subordinates from his
days as the Illinois secretary of state, and to reports that prosecutors were
examining his conduct while in that position.
Months later, as his term ended, Mr. Ryan pardoned four death-row inmates whose
innocence had been proved by new evidence. He then exercised the ultimate
authority in his arsenal by commuting, to life terms, the death sentences of all 167
inmates still facing execution in Illinois. It was the largest commutation of death-
row sentences in the nation’s history, and it stripped the Illinois death row bare of
inmates.
He announced his decision in a speech before a large audience in a hall at the
Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago.
“I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death,” the governor said, quoting
Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun of the United States Supreme Court. He
added:
“The legislature couldn’t reform it. Lawmakers won’t repeal it. But I will not stand
for it. I must act. Our capital system is haunted by the demon of error, error in
determining guilt, and error in determining who among the guilty deserves to die.”
Mr. Ryan’s attack on capital punishment drew praise from world leaders, including
Pope John Paul II and, in South Africa, former President Nelson Mandela and
Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Mr. Ryan was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.
But history was closing in on him.
The origins of his downfall lay in a decade-old federal corruption investigation
called “Operation Safe Road.” It had uncovered the illegal sale of government
contracts, leases and even driver’s licenses to incompetent truckers, some of whom
were involved in fatal highway crashes. At least 79 people — former subordinates
of Mr. Ryan, lobbyists and others — were implicated and charged with felonies.
Nearly all were convicted and served prison terms.
In 2003, Mr. Ryan spoke to a large gathering at Northwestern University College of Law in Chicago.
During the speech, he announced he was commuting the sentences of all 160 inmates on death row in
Illinois. Jeff Haynes/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images
In 2004, the investigation reached Mr. Ryan: He was accused of accepting $167,000
in cash, vacations and gifts for himself, his family and friends. Indicted on charges
of fraud and racketeering, he was convicted on 18 counts after a five-month trial in
2006 and sentenced to six and a half years in prison, a term spent mostly at a
federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind. He was temporarily released in 2011 to
visit his wife, Lura Lynn Ryan, in a hospital in Kankakee on the day she died of
lung cancer.
Scott Turow, a lawyer, author and member of the commission that Mr. Ryan had
named to review the state’s capital cases, posed a rhetorical question to reporters
about the man who had plumbed the limits of power and disgrace: “Who was
George Ryan?” Mr. Turow asked after the conviction. “It’s a question best put to
Shakespeare.”
George Homer Ryan, the youngest of three children of Thomas and Jeanette
(Bowman) Ryan, was born on Feb. 24, 1934, in Maquoketa, Iowa, where his
mother’s family raised cattle. Months after his birth, his father earned a pharmacy
degree from the University of Iowa and took a job with Walgreens, the drugstore
chain.
After a brief posting at a Walgreens on the South Side of Chicago, Thomas Ryan
was transferred to a store in Kankakee, a small city an hour’s drive south of
Chicago, where the family settled and where George; his sister, Kathleen; and his
brother, Tom, grew up and attended public schools. In 1947, the Ryans adopted 15-
year-old Nancy Schrey after the death of her widowed father, Harry Schrey, a
friend of the family.
In 1948, Thomas Ryan opened his own pharmacy in Kankakee. George, a freshman
at Kankakee High School, worked there on lunch hours and weekends, making
sodas, washing dishes and scrubbing floors. He also found time to play high school
football and baseball.
“I worked the fountain and realized that if I was ever going to be an owner of the
pharmacy, I had to be a pharmacist,” Mr. Ryan told Illinois Periodicals Online for a
profile published in 1998. After graduating from Kankakee High in 1952, he worked
full-time for his father, as did Tom, Kathleen and, after she married, her husband,
Duane Dean. At one point, four Ryan pharmacies in the Kankakee area were
operated by family members.
George was drafted by the Army in 1954. He spent 13 months in Korea, was
discharged in 1956 and returned to the family business. In 1961, he earned a
Bachelor of Science degree in pharmacy from Ferris State College (now Ferris
State University) in Big Rapids, Mich. He and his siblings were co-owners of the
family drugstores until 1990, when the chain was sold.
While Mr. Ryan had his sights on politics, it was his brother, Tom Ryan, who
jumped in first. He was elected mayor of Kankakee in 1965 and held the post for 20
years.
Mr. Ryan began his political career on the Kankakee County board of supervisors
from 1968 to 1973. He was then elected to a seat in the Illinois House of
Representatives, serving from 1973 to 1983, with two terms as minority leader and
one as speaker. Over the next 20 years, he was elected to the state’s highest offices,
as lieutenant governor under Gov. James R. Thompson (1983-91); as a two-term
secretary of state (1991-99); and finally as governor of Illinois (1999-2003).

sitting American governor to meet Mr. Castro there. Jorge Rey/Associated Press
Mr. Ryan defeated a five-term Democratic Illinois congressman, Glenn Poshard,
for the governorship in 1998 with 51 percent of the vote to Mr. Poshard’s 47 percent.
Mr. Ryan’s most ambitious undertaking as governor was a $12 billion effort to
rebuild the state’s roads, schools and transit systems. In 1999, he became the first
sitting American governor to meet President Fidel Castro of Cuba in Havana. The
next year, he was named chairman of the Midwestern Governors Association and
the Illinois chairman of George W. Bush’s campaign for the presidency.
In 1956, he married his high school sweetheart, Lura Lynn Lowe, whose family
owned one of the first hybrid seed companies in the United States.
In addition to his son, Mr. Ryan is survived by five daughters, Julie Koehl, Joanne
Barrow, Jeanette Schneider, Lynda Fairman and Nancy Coghlan; 17 grandchildren;
and 21 great-grandchildren.
The Illinois death penalty was abolished on March 9, 2011, with Gov. Pat Quinn, a
Democrat, signing the legislation. The 15 people then on death row had their

Adam Liptak,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Asks Supreme Court to Let DOGE View Social Security Data,"The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to let members of
Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have access to sensitive
records of the Social Security Administration.
“This emergency application,” D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, wrote, “presents
a now-familiar theme: a district court has issued sweeping injunctive relief without
legal authority to do so, in ways that inflict ongoing, irreparable harm on urgent
federal priorities and stymie the executive branch’s functions.”
The administration has filed a barrage of such applications in recent weeks,
including one in an immigration case on Thursday. Several of them await decisions
from the justices, who are also set to hear arguments on May 15 on the scope of
permissible injunctions in challenges to President Trump’s efforts to do away with
birthright citizenship.
Mr. Trump and his allies have complained bitterly about lower court judges who
have blocked his initiatives, including by issuing injunctions that apply nationwide.
Judge Ellen L. Hollander, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland,
imposed strict conditions last month on access to the records in light of the
agency’s “abiding commitment to the privacy and confidentiality of the personal
information entrusted to it by the American people.”
Judge Hollander said the agency could provide members of the DOGE team “with
access to redacted or anonymized data and records,” but only after they received
training on privacy laws and policies, were subjected to background investigations
and satisfied other requirements.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected the administration’s
request to pause the judge’s injunction while an appeal moved forward.

consequences of the court’s work.”
Learn about how Adam Liptak approaches covering the court.
The Supreme Court ordered the challengers, two labor unions and an advocacy
group, to respond to the administration’s application by May 12.
Mr. Sauer wrote that Judge Hollander, who was appointed by President Barack
Obama, had exceeded her authority. “The district court is forcing the executive
branch,” he wrote, “to stop employees charged with modernizing government
information systems from accessing the data in those systems because, in the
court’s judgment, those employees do not ‘need’ such access.”
He added: “The government cannot eliminate waste and fraud if district courts bar
the very agency personnel with expertise and the designated mission of curtailing
such waste and fraud from performing their jobs.”
In other lawsuits challenging Mr. Musk’s aggressive incursions into government
records, some judges have issued similar orders barring officials from handing
over sensitive data. As President Trump has pursued efforts to deport students and
other foreign nationals, lawyers have argued that agencies’ data systems could be
used to aid a broader immigration crackdown.
In her ruling, Judge Hollander wrote that the “intrusion into the personal affairs of
millions of Americans — absent an adequate explanation for the need to do so — is
not in the public interest,” especially because the agency “has long communicated
to the public its commitment to privacy.”
“To be sure,” she added, “rooting out possible fraud, waste and mismanagement” in
the agency “is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government
can flout the law to do so.”
Mr. Sauer told the justices that Judge Hollander should not be allowed to interfere
in the executive branch’s operations.
“The district court’s flawed injunction,” Mr. Sauer wrote, “forecloses the executive
branch from carrying out the pressing priorities of modernizing government
information systems and ferreting out fraud, waste, and abuse — all at the behest
of plaintiffs who gave their information to the agencies with the knowledge that
other government employees may access their data.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/supreme-court-doge-social-security.html
Tim Balk,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Administration Settles With Maine to Restore Frozen Funds Over Trans Athlete Feud,"The Trump administration and Maine reached an agreement that restored funding
for schoolchildren, Maine’s attorney general said Friday, part of a feud between the
president and the state’s governor over policies on transgender athletes.
The state’s attorney general, Aaron M. Frey, said his office had withdrawn a lawsuit
it filed in objection to the funding freeze, which had held up around $3 million, he
estimated, and was initiated by the Agriculture Department last month. The federal
dollars, Mr. Frey said in an interview, pay for food preparation in schools and child
care centers, and also assist in feeding disabled adults in congregate settings.
The Agriculture Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for
comment, had said the freeze would not deprive children of food.
The conflict between President Trump and Maine’s governor, Janet Mills, a
Democrat, escalated at an event at the White House in February. Mr. Trump told
Ms. Mills that she had “better comply” with his executive order barring
transgender athletes from participating in women’s and girls’ sports. The governor,
whose state has refused to follow the order, replied, “See you in court.”
The U.S. and Maine Reach Deal to Restore
Funds in Feud on Transgender Athletes
The agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, cited the state’s unwillingness to comply
with the executive order when the federal funds were frozen. She said in a
statement in April that her agency was reviewing grants awarded to Maine by the
Biden administration, casting them as potentially “wasteful, redundant, or
otherwise against the priorities of the Trump Administration.”
Five days later, Mr. Frey filed his lawsuit, saying that the pause was affecting
children and at-risk adults.
“The food doesn’t just buy itself, deliver itself, cook itself,” Mr. Frey said Friday,
adding that the Trump administration had tried to “bully” Maine. “The message
here is if you don’t follow the law and you try to target Maine without relying on
any shred of law to support it, we’re going to have to take you to court.”
The White House deferred comment to the Agriculture Department.
Ms. Mills said in a statement that the Trump administration had made an “unlawful
attempt to freeze critical funding.” But the agreement, she said, will preserve
healthy meals for about 170,000 schoolchildren across Maine.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-maine-funding-

Adam Liptak,NYT,1,US,5/1/2025,Trump Asks Supreme Court to Lift Deportation Protections for Venezuelans,"The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to let it remove
protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants who had been
allowed to remain in the United States without risk of deportation under a program
known as Temporary Protected Status.
In February, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, terminated an 18-
month extension of T.P.S. protection that had been granted to Venezuelans by the
Biden administration. People affected by the change sued, saying that the move
violated administrative procedures and was influenced by racial bias.
In March, Judge Edward M. Chen of the Federal District Court in San Francisco
blocked the administration’s efforts to remove the protections for Venezuelans
while the case moved forward. He said that the plaintiffs had demonstrated they
were likely to succeed in showing that Ms. Noem’s actions were “unauthorized by
law, arbitrary and capricious, and motivated by unconstitutional animus.”
Judge Chen found that terminating the initiative would inflict irreparable harm “on
hundreds of thousands of persons whose lives, families and livelihoods will be
severely disrupted, cost the United States billions in economic activity and injure
public health and safety in communities throughout the United States.”
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the administration’s
request that it pause Judge Chen’s ruling.
The Supreme Court has fielded several other emergency applications involving Mr.
Trump’s aggressive immigration policies. In one, the court ordered the
administration to facilitate the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who had
wrongly been sent to El Salvador, where he remains. In another, the justices
temporarily blocked the removal of some Venezuelan immigrants under the Alien
Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law.
The court is also set to hear arguments on May 15 on the scope of three rulings
blocking an executive order seeking to do away with birthright citizenship.

The Temporary Protected Status program, enacted by Congress and signed into
law by President George H.W. Bush, allows migrants from nations that have
experienced national disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary instability
to live and work legally in the United States.
President Trump has looked to end protections under the program as he seeks to
make good on his campaign promise to deport millions of immigrants from the
United States. His efforts would have terminated them for nearly 350,000 people in
early April, and for hundreds of thousands more later this year.
In the administration’s emergency application, D. John Sauer, the solicitor general,
wrote that the law creating the program specifically barred judicial second-
guessing of the executive branch’s decisions. A provision of the law said that “there
is no judicial review of any determination” concerning “the designation, or
termination or extension of a designation, of a foreign state.”
Judge Chen said that provision did not prohibit him from deciding whether Ms.
Noem was authorized to vacate the protections.
Mr. Sauer also criticized the scope of Judge Chen’s ruling.
“The district court entered nationwide relief supplanting Secretary Noem’s
assessment of the national interest — an area into which a district court is uniquely
unqualified to intrude,” Mr. Sauer wrote. “The court thus wrested control of the
nation’s immigration policy away from the executive branch and imposed the
court’s own perception as to whether the government’s actions might ‘contradict
U.S. foreign policies,’ ‘have adverse national security ramifications’ or ‘weaken the
standing of the United States in the international community,’” he wrote, citing
phrases from the ruling.
Mr. Sauer asked the justices to act promptly. “This court’s immediate attention is
especially warranted,” he wrote, “because protracted litigation will effectively
preclude the president from enforcing a critical component of the administration’s
immigration policy.”
The court ordered the challengers to respond to the application by May 8.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/trump-supreme-court-tps.html
Sheryl Gay Stolberg,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump’s Budget Calls for Deep Cuts to NIH and CDC,"President Trump used his budget blueprint on Friday to forge ahead with his
assault on the nation’s public health and biomedical research enterprise, proposing
draconian cuts to the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention that experts warned would upend decades of progress in
advancing human health, well-being and longevity.
In hard numbers and biting words, the budget wipes out a string of programs,
including one that helps low-income people living in cold climates pay heating bills.
It eliminates C.D.C. programs devoted to preventing chronic disease and injuries,
including gun violence injuries, dismissing those programs as “duplicative” and
“unnecessary.”
It calls the N.I.H., the world’s premier biomedical research agency, “too big and
unfocused.” The document argues that the institutes have “broken the trust of the
American people,” while effectively accusing the agency of funding research that
led to the coronavirus pandemic. It says the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services, the federal agency that provides health care to more than 160 million
Americans, has carried out “wasteful and woke activities.”
Trump’s Budget Calls for Deep Cuts to Public
Health Programs and Research
In some respects, the plan is not surprising; Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy
Jr. has already announced that he is shrinking the federal Department of Health
and Human Services, which oversees the N.I.H. and the C.D.C., by 20,000 people.
The blueprint proposes $500 million for Mr. Kennedy’s Make America Healthy
Again initiative.
Yet the budget proposal takes aim at some initiatives that Mr. Kennedy might seem
to favor. It eliminates the National Center for Complementary and Integrative
Health, which focuses on alternative therapies. And Mr. Kennedy often says he
wants to improve the health of Native Americans, many of whom rely on the home
heating program Mr. Trump wants to cut.
The plan would slash $18 billion out of the N.I.H. budget, shrinking it to $27 billion
— a stark contrast from its heyday in the 1990s, when a bipartisan Congress voted
to double its budget within five years because Republicans argued biomedical
research was an engine for economic growth.
The proposed budget is only a blueprint — a statement of Mr. Trump’s priorities. It
will now go to Congress, where it is already facing hurdles.
Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and the chairwoman of the
Appropriations Committee, said Friday that she had “serious objections” to cuts to
the home heating program, which helps many of her constituents survive the cold
New England winters, and to programs “that support biomedical research.”
Mr. Trump also proposes shutting down the National Institute for Minority and
Health Disparities, a branch of the N.I.H. devoted to studying ways to improve the
health of minorities, including Native Americans, who often suffer higher rates of
chronic disease than white people.
The budget said the institute was “replete with D.E.I. expenditures” — a reference
to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which the president has systematically
moved to dismantle within the government.
“Eliminating these efforts would reverse decades of progress,” said Dr. Thomas R.
Frieden, who ran the C.D.C. under President Barack Obama. “You don’t improve
things by destroying them. You improve them by improving them.”
The budget blueprint does not talk about the Food and Drug Administration. Dr.
David A. Kessler, who ran the F.D.A. under both Republican and Democratic
administrations, has argued that deep cuts to biomedical research funding will put
the United States at a competitive disadvantage with China.
At a recent hearing on Capitol Hill, he reminded lawmakers of the Cold War era,
when the federal government ramped up its investment in research after the
Soviet Union became the first nation to launch a space satellite.
“Whatever needs to be fixed, let’s fix it, but we need to make a marked increase in
our investment,” Dr. Kessler said. ”This is Sputnik 2.0, but with China.
While chronic disease and injuries are now major causes of death in the United
States, the C.D.C.’s scope would be narrowed and would return to its original
mission of protecting Americans against infectious disease. The agency’s budget
would be cut nearly in half; it would lose $3.5 billion in funding, leaving it with
“more than $4 billion,” the proposal said.
Protesters attend a candlelight vigil outside the front entrance of the Centers for

Mary Woolley, the longtime chief executive officer of Research America, an
advocacy group that promotes biomedical research, said the effects of Mr. Trump’s
proposal would be felt over the long term by slowing studies that could lead to
treatments for a range of diseases, including childhood cancer, Alzheimer’s disease
and Lupus, the chronic autoimmune disease.
But she also said there would be short-term effects. Patients are already losing
access to experimental drugs because clinical trials have been shut down as a
result of recent budget cuts, she said. She worried that young researchers would
conclude that “they have no future in this country and should look elsewhere.”
Some are already being recruited by countries, including China, she said, adding,
“If you don’t have the next generation, you have nothing.”
Polls show that most Americans support biomedical research. A recent survey by
KFF found that a majority of the public, 61 percent, opposed major cuts to staff and
spending at federal health agencies. There were stark differences along party lines,
with 9 out of 10 Democrats opposing the cuts, and 72 percent of Republicans
supporting them.
Ms. Woolley cited a recent report by United for Medical Research, a coalition of
patients, advocacy groups, industry and academic medical institutions, that found
N.I.H.-funded research is an economic engine, returning $2.56 for every $1
invested.
Protesters attend a candlelight vigil outside the front entrance of the Centers for

The budget also proposes cutting more than $1 billion from the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration, which directs funds and support
nationwide to address two of the country’s biggest public health crises.
While Mr. Kennedy, a recovering heroin addict, has said he is concerned in
particular about the opioid epidemic, the budget rails against the public health
strategy known as “harm reduction,” which was supported by the Biden
administration and involves decreasing the risk of deaths and overdoses by
ensuring that people who use illicit substances can do so safely.
It specifically criticizes “safe smoking kits” and “syringes.”
The heating program, called the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
was labeled “unnecessary.” The document justified eliminating it by citing Mr.
Trump’s promises to increase domestic oil and gas production and reduce energy
prices.
The Government Accountability Office has raised significant integrity concerns
related to fraud and abuse in the program, but it currently helps 6.2 million
Americans from Texas to Maine offset their high utility bills. Last month, the
administration fired everyone working in the office that administers the program.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-budget-cdc-nih-cuts.html
Michael Levenson,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,7 Killed in Crash Involving a Tour Van and a Pickup Near Yellowstone,"A pickup truck and a passenger van carrying a tour group collided in Idaho near
Yellowstone National Park on Thursday evening, killing seven people, the Idaho
State Police said. Both of the vehicles caught fire after the crash.
Six of those killed were in the van, a Mercedes, which was carrying 14 people, the
State Police said. The driver of the pickup, a Dodge Ram, was also killed.
The crash happened just before 7:15 p.m. on U.S. Highway 20 near Henry’s Lake, a
popular spot for hiking, biking and fishing in eastern Idaho, about 15 miles from
Yellowstone. The cause was under investigation.
The State Police said that the authorities had summoned an air ambulance and
other air and ground resources to respond to the crash because of the severity of
the injuries.
The Fremont County coroner, Brenda Dye, identified the driver and sole occupant
of the pickup as Isaiah Moreno, 25, of Texas. Ms. Dye said that she was waiting for
the results of DNA testing to identify the six people in the van who were killed,
because the bodies were unrecognizable.
All six were from outside the United States, Ms. Dye said in an interview on Friday.
Two were from Italy, she said, and it wasn’t clear where the other four were from.
They had been part of a group that was touring Yellowstone, she said.
After the crash, two others on the highway jumped out of their vehicle to help, she
said. They were “trying to pull out as many as they could,” from the van, which was
emitting smoke, Ms. Dye said. She said they succeeded in helping eight people out
of the van, including a child, before the van caught fire.
U.S. Highway 20 was closed for nearly seven hours while emergency responders
and the Idaho Transportation Department worked to manage the scene and clear
the roadway, the State Police said.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/yellowstone-tour-van-fatal-

Stocks on Friday erased losses suffered in the days after President Trump’s chaotic
rollout of tariffs in early April, bolstered in part by a healthy report on the labor
market.
The S&P 500 rose 1.5 percent on Friday, climbing back above where it stood before
chaos descended on financial markets after April 2 — Mr. Trump’s so-called
Liberation Day, which featured his most sweeping tariffs to date.
Friday’s boost to stock prices followed a stronger-than-expected report on hiring in
April. But the S&P 500 has been edging higher for days — logging nine consecutive
daily increases — as Mr. Trump and members of his administration raised hopes
that trade tensions would ease, including by indicating they were willing to engage
in talks with China.
Early Friday, China’s commerce ministry said in a statement that it, too, was
considering holding talks with the Trump administration, but only if Washington
canceled its tariffs on Chinese goods first.
The two countries remain far from any deal that would resolve their trade war, but
even the prospect of talks has been enough to ease the worst of the anxiety that
gripped investors a month ago.
“If the labor market holds up and the Trump administration walks back the most
egregious tariffs, the economy could skirt a deep recession,” said Jeffrey Roach,
chief economist at LPL Financial.
Still, despite the recent optimism and recovery, the S&P 500 is more than 7 percent
below its recent high in mid-February. It has fallen about 5 percent since Mr.
Trump’s inauguration in January.
Questions remain about whether Mr. Trump’s tariffs might cause a sharp slowdown
in economic growth, which could result if companies start pulling back on hiring,
spending and investments amid the uncertainty. As they have reported quarterly
earnings in recent days, many companies have said they are struggling to forecast
how the rest of the year will shape up because of the lack of clarity on trade policy.
Several consumer companies have said they’ll have to raise prices — which could
further dent the economy if it discourages spending.
Though Mr. Trump backed off the most extreme tariffs on dozens of countries,
many imports into the United States now face new taxes of at least 10 percent,
while products from China are being taxed a minimum of 145 percent. On Friday, a
provision that had allowed for low-value shipments from mainland China and Hong
Kong to evade tariffs altogether closed. And on Saturday, new tariffs of 25 percent
on imported auto parts are expected to take effect. That’s in addition to a tax of 25
percent on imported cars that already took effect in April.
Volatility in recent weeks has underscored the degree to which sentiment on Wall
Street is still driven by concern about the economic fallout from the Trump
administration’s policies. Mr. Trump’s 90-day pause of many of the tariffs that he
announced on April 2 will end in July.
“The damage to economic momentum has already been done,” said Mike Sanders,
head of fixed income at Madison Investments. “Deals may come, but the real
question is how long the data will take to reflect the harm.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/business/stock-market-recovery-trump-tariffs.html

Officials in the United States are urging Japan and South Korea to make a formal
commitment within the next few weeks to a $44 billion natural gas project in
Alaska.
The effort, known as Alaska L.N.G., is a centerpiece of President Trump’s energy
agenda, and aims to ship gas from northern Alaska in a liquefied form to nations in
Asia. Its feasibility hinges on securing backing from the region, home to some of
the world’s largest purchasers of liquefied natural gas.
A group created by Mr. Trump that is advising him on domestic energy production,
the National Energy Dominance Council, is seeking to convene officials from the
trade ministries of both Japan and South Korea for a summit in Alaska on June 2,
according to three people with knowledge of the confidential outreach who
requested anonymity.
The project’s proponents want to be able to announce at the summit that they have
received signed letters of intent from Japan and South Korea to invest in Alaska
L.N.G. or purchase its gas, the people said. Taiwan formally signed a similar letter
of intent to purchase gas from Alaska L.N.G. last month.
The Japanese and South Korean trade ministries did not respond to requests for
comment. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Energy said Alaska L.N.G. has
the potential to provide energy security for the United States and its allies, as well
as create jobs and reduce the U.S. trade deficit. Mr. Trump and Energy Secretary
Chris Wright “are committed,” he said, to supporting Alaska L.N.G.
Alaska L.N.G., first proposed more than a decade ago, had been considered by
many in the energy industry to be a long shot. But it occupies a prominent spot in
Mr. Trump’s efforts to reshape the U.S. energy landscape and restore momentum
for fossil fuels.

The plan is to construct an 800-mile pipeline from fields north of the Arctic Circle to
southern Alaska. From there, the gas would be cooled into liquid form and shipped
on tankers to Asia.
For Asian countries, shipping L.N.G. from Alaska would be cheaper and quicker
than importing it from many of their traditional sources, including Australia, the
Middle East and the Gulf Coast of the United States.
But major Asian buyers of the fuel, including Japan, have long been cautious about
the Alaska L.N.G. project because of its substantial costs, and doubts that it would
actually be able to get off the ground.
On his first day in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order aimed at
“unleashing” Alaska’s energy potential, including the pipeline proposal.

Japan, South Korea and Taiwan face the possibility of additional double-digit-
percentage tariffs, which have been imposed by Mr. Trump on numerous U.S.
trading partners. Economists have warned that the tariffs, which have been paused
until early July, could severely slow economic growth if they take effect.
Japan, which initiated tariff talks with the United States last week, has indicated
that pledges to purchase more American liquefied natural gas would be a
significant component of its offer to the administration. South Korea has made
similar promises and is set to begin negotiations in Washington on Thursday.
Last month, Taiwan’s state oil and gas company, CPC, signed a letter of intent to
buy six million metric tons of gas from Alaska L.N.G. That would represent almost
a third of the total amount of liquefied natural gas Taiwan imported last year.
Mr. Trump has said he believes that countries in Asia would sign on to support the
Alaska project. During his address to Congress in March, he said Japan and South
Korea wanted to invest “trillions of dollars each” in the project, a statement that
took officials in Tokyo and Seoul by surprise. He did not clarify how the project,
which isn’t expected to begin shipping liquefied gas until the early 2030s, would
receive trillions in investment.
In Japan, and most likely elsewhere, the challenge will be securing private-sector
buyers willing to align with government plans and enter into long-term
agreements to purchase gas from Alaska L.N.G. In Japan, U.S. officials see three
energy companies — Jera, Tokyo Gas and Inpex — as potential customers, two of
the people familiar with the matter said.
Many remain wary of the economics of such a deal. Letters of intent to participate
in the project are likely to include room to withdraw. Alaska L.N.G. says the price of
its gas would be competitive when it begins operations.

Daisuke Wakabayashi,NYT,1,Business,4/25/2025,Uncertainty Over Trump’s Tariffs Paralyzes U.S. Businesses,"Three months ago, things were looking pretty good for Tim Fulton and Ramper
Innovations, a manufacturer of airplane equipment based in Sitka, Alaska.
Mr. Fulton was spending his days inside his workshop doing what he loved:
building the company’s main product — a fold-up conveyor belt that unfurls in the
belly of a plane to load and unload cargo or luggage. He had an order from the U.S.
Air Force that he was confident would serve as a catalyst and bring in new
customers from Asia and the Middle East while luring potential investors.
Then, the tariffs from President Trump struck.
The New York Times heard from Mr. Fulton and hundreds of other American
business owners who said they have been stunned into paralysis by Mr. Trump’s
barrage of tariffs. They are reassessing their product lines and supply chains and
even putting their operations on hold.
‘Things Have Ground to a
Halt’: Tariff Uncertainty
Paralyzes Businesses
Mr. Fulton, 66, was floored at the size of the tariffs and how quickly and chaotically
they were applied. There were tariffs on Mexico and Canada and steel and
aluminum. Mr. Trump hit dozens of countries with higher “reciprocal” tariffs he
then put on hold when financial markets crashed. China struck back and the import
tariff on Chinese goods ratcheted up to 145 percent.
Even though Ramper makes its products in the United States and buys as much of
its components as possible from American companies, there is no getting around
the tariffs. Some essential parts, such as motorized and static rollers from Japan,
are only available overseas. The raw materials needed to build other critical parts
are also imported. Most of Ramper’s U.S. suppliers rely on imports for some part of
their supply chain.
Ramper raised its price 17 percent — a ballpark estimate for how much the tariffs
would inflate its costs. Mr. Fulton also warned prospective customers that he may
need to increase his price further if tariffs pushed  his costs up by more than 5
percent. Prospective customers balked at the higher prices and the uncertainty of
what the final price might be.
After years of refining and testing his foldable conveyor belt, a robust pipeline of
interested buyers disappeared overnight, Mr. Fulton said. Potential investors
turned gun-shy, afraid to plow money into a company at the mercy of arbitrary
tariff policies.
“I feel like things have ground to a halt,” said Mr. Fulton, who started the company
in 2019 after working 38 years as a ramp agent, an airline ground crew member
who loads and unloads baggage.

With no orders to fill, Mr. Fulton rented out his home in Alaska and temporarily
moved to Brazil, where his wife is from, because the cost of living is lower. And
instead of closing deals with investors to raise more money, he is consulting a
bankruptcy lawyer.
Businesses are rushing to cancel factory orders or halt shipping containers before
they leave China, unable to afford the tariff when the ships arrive in America. They
are pausing capital investments and new hiring, and scaling back spending to only
the bare necessities. Future products are being scrapped, because they are no
longer financially viable.

“Everything is stuck and no one knows what to do,” said Kristina Anisimova, who
owns SinoImport USA, a supply chain management firm based in Mooresville, N.
C.
Ms. Anisimova said one-third of her customers, most of whom work primarily with
Chinese factories, are suspending shipping orders, hoping that the tariffs are
eventually eased.
She said the unluckiest companies are the ones whose shipments are already in
transit, because they no longer have the option of delaying or stopping an order.
When their goods arrive in the United States, some of those companies will be
forced to pay twice as much as they had budgeted to take delivery of their
products.
“When you consider a project, you can see what you have to pay. But in this
situation, you cannot predict anything,” said Ms. Anisimova. “And now everything
is on pause.”

Robb Stilnovich, owner of Premier Columbaria, a supplier of cremation memorials
based in Centralia, Wash., said coming off a record year in 2024, his company was
considering remodeling its warehouse to store more inventory and buying a new
forklift. But those plans are now on hold.
Premier Columbaria’s modular granite memorials manufactured in China are now
carrying an import tax of 174 percent, compared to 29 percent last year. He ships 80
to 100 containers a year from China.
Without any certainty in what projects might end up costing, his cemetery
customers are choosing to wait and see how things shake out. His future orders
were down 97 percent compared to a year ago.
He said one prospective customer had agreed to place an order with a 150 percent
markup. Mr. Stilnovich came up with  that number based on what his shipping
company had estimated weeks ago was the maximum tariff that could be applied.
But when the actual rate surged even higher, the customer canceled.
“Everybody just hit pause, and they’re saying ‘Let’s see what happens in six
months,’” said Mr. Stilnovich, 53. “If I am down 97 percent compared to last year, I
can’t stay in business too long.”
He is also worried about how the pause will affect his longtime Chinese factory
partner, who has worked with his company for two decades and has specialized
equipment and know-how critical to producing his products. Mr. Stilnovich said he
was on his way to Xiamen, in southeastern China, to help manage layoffs at that
partner’s factory.
Mr. Stilnovich said he has three containers in transit. He expects to be taxed at 50
percent for two of those containers because they shipped before the latest
escalation in tariffs. For the last one, he expects the shipment to carry a 174 percent
tariff, requiring him to pay $80,000 at the port.

In the workshop, stacks of fabricated frames made of aluminum, a metal subject to tariffs. Mr. Fulton said
he was floored at the size of President Trump’s tariffs and how quickly and chaotically they were applied.

He said exposure to such unforeseen costs is “devastating” to his company, a
family-run operation of 20-plus years. Mr. Stilnovich’s wife takes care of the back
office and his brother handles sales. He said they have inventory and projects lined
up until August, but then things “drop off a cliff.”
Any pause is especially harsh for small businesses with limited cash flow. They are
usually working without much cushion to weather a sudden interruption, and they
have less negotiating power to persuade suppliers to hold orders for an extended
period of time.
For Mr. Fulton of Ramper Innovations, the priority has become working on deals to
maintain some momentum for his company even if the baggage-loading product is
no longer made in the United States. He has an agreement with an Italian company
that will license his product and make it in Europe for sale in European, Middle
Eastern and African markets. He is looking into a similar deal with potential
partners in Thailand or India.
It’s not what he envisioned when he invested his retirement funds into the
company. He wanted to manufacture in America. Specifically he wanted to prove
wrong the naysayers who said making a product in Alaska was crazy.
While Mr. Fulton said he is trying to remain positive and optimistic, he said he is
not sure how the company is going to make it.
“It puts a lump in my heart when I allow myself to think about what’s coming
down,” he said. “There are these places where I might be able to get a finger hold,
but it doesn’t feel like I’m going to be able to pull myself up.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/business/trump-tariffs-american-importers.html
Benjamin Mullin,NYT,1,Business,4/24/2025,Publisher of PCMag and Mashable Sues OpenAI,"Ziff Davis, the digital publisher behind tech sites like Mashable, PCMag and
Lifehacker, sued OpenAI on Thursday, joining a wave of media companies accusing
the artificial intelligence giant of stealing its content.
Ziff Davis is one of the largest publishers in the United States, with more than 45
sites globally that together attract an average of 292 million visitors per month,
and is among the biggest media companies pressing a claim against OpenAI.
(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming
copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies
have denied the suit’s claims.)
In a 62-page complaint filed in federal court in Delaware, where OpenAI is
incorporated, Ziff Davis says the tech company has “intentionally and relentlessly
reproduced exact copies and created derivatives of Ziff Davis works,” infringing on
the publisher’s copyrights and diluting its trademarks. It claims that OpenAI used
Ziff Davis content to train its artificial intelligence models and generate responses
through its popular ChatGPT chatbot.
“OpenAI has taken each of these steps knowing that they violate Ziff Davis’s
intellectual property rights and the law,” the complaint says.
The company is seeking at least hundreds of millions of dollars in its lawsuit,
according to two people familiar with the matter.
A spokesman for OpenAI said in a statement that its models were “grounded in fair
use,” referring to the legal standard for use of copyrighted material.
“ChatGPT helps enhance human creativity, advance scientific discovery and
medical research, and enable hundreds of millions of people to improve their daily
lives,” the statement said.
Many executives in the publishing industry, which was profoundly disrupted by the
widespread adoption of technologies such as search and social media, have
regarded the growing popularity of artificial intelligence with increasing unease.
Powerful A.I. systems built by companies like OpenAI have been trained on
copyrighted content, drawing an outcry from many media companies.
Those companies have generally responded in one of two ways: striking deals to
license their content to companies like OpenAI for millions of dollars, as in the case
with News Corp, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, or filing lawsuits to seek
damages and reaffirm their rights to intellectual property.
Many of those claims are still working their way through courts. This month, a U.S.
judicial panel consolidated several claims against OpenAI, including the one
brought by The Times.
Executives at Ziff Davis have been considering for months which path to take, one
of the people said. The company decided to sue, in part, in the hope that other
publishers would follow.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/business/media/ziff-davis-openai-lawsuit.html

the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate he built into a $1.1
trillion colossus.
By the end of the year, he is preparing to give up that role.
Mr. Buffett said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday that he
plans to ask Berkshire’s board to approve making Gregory Abel, his heir apparent,
the chief executive by the end of the year.
“I would still hang around and conceivably be useful in a few cases,” Mr. Buffett, 94,
told the tens of thousands of Berkshire shareholders at the meeting in Omaha, the
company’s headquarters. But Mr. Abel would have “the final word” when it comes
to the company’s operations, how it invests and more.

Mr. Buffett’s plan — which he said had been known only to two of his children who
sit on the company’s board, Howard and Susan Buffett — was greeted by a minute-
long standing ovation by Berkshire shareholders.
If the board approves the plan, it would mark the end of an era for one of the most
successful companies in modern capitalist history, and one of its most famous
investors. Mr. Buffett has amassed what Forbes estimates is a $168 billion fortune
by being a savvy stock picker, buying up huge companies and assembling a
conglomerate that runs a huge insurance operation, a major railroad, dozens of
consumer companies and oversees a vast stock portfolio.
It has made Mr. Buffett one of the most influential businessmen in the world, giving
his pronouncements on many topics, including politics, great weight. That included
his criticism of President Trump’s trade policies as a mistake: “Trade should not be
a weapon,” Mr. Buffett said. “I don’t think it’s right and I don’t think it’s wise.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/business/berkshire-earnings-warren-buffett.html
Christina Jewett,NYT,1,Business,4/25/2025,F.D.A. Scientists Are Reinstated at Agency Food Safety Labs,"Federal health officials have reversed the decision to fire a few dozen scientists at
the Food and Drug Administration’s food-safety labs, and say they are conducting a
review to determine if other critical posts were cut.
A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the
rehirings and said that several employees would also be restored to the offices that
deal with Freedom of Information requests, an area that was nearly wiped out.
In the last few months, roughly 3,500 F.D.A. jobs, about 20 percent, were
eliminated, representing one of the largest work force reductions among all
government agencies targeted by the Trump administration.
The H.H.S. spokesman said those employees called back had been inadvertently
fired because of inaccurate job classification codes.
The decision to rehire specialists on outbreaks of food-related illnesses and those
who study the safety of products like infant formula follows contradictory
assertions made by Dr. Marty Makary, the F.D.A. commissioner, in media
interviews this week.
“I can tell you there were no cuts to scientists or inspectors,” Dr. Makary said
Wednesday on CNN.
In fact, scientists had been fired from several food and drug safety labs across the
country, including in Puerto Rico, and from the veterinary division where bird flu
safety work was underway. Scientists in the tobacco division who were dismissed
in February — including some who studied the health effects of e-cigarettes —
remain on paid leave and have not been tapped to return, according to employees
who were put on leave.
How many fired employees will be permitted to return remained unclear.
About 40 employees at the Moffett Lab in Chicago and at a San Francisco-area lab
are being offered their jobs back, the department spokesman said. Scientists in
those labs studied a variety of aspects of food safety, from how chemicals and
germs pass through food packaging to methods for keeping bacteria out of infant
formula. Some scientists in Chicago reviewed the work and results of other labs to
ensure that milk and seafood were safe.
Dr. Robert Califf, the F.D.A. commissioner under President Joseph R. Biden, said
the terms “decapitated and eviscerated” seemed fitting to describe the steep loss of
expertise at the agency. He said the F.D.A. was already falling behind on meetings
meant to help companies develop safe products — and to design studies that give
clear answers about their effectiveness.
“Most of it is really at this level of fundamental, day-to-day work that has a huge
impact overall, but it’s not very controversial,” he said. “It’s just that it takes work,
and they have to have people to do the work.”
Dr. Makary has also said the layoffs did not target product reviewers or inspectors.
But their work has been hampered by voluntary departures, the elimination of
support staff and the broader disruption at an agency where many are fleeing for
the exits, according to former staff members.
Hundreds of drug and medical device reviewers, who make up about one-fourth of
the agency work force, have recused themselves from key projects, Dr. Scott
Gottlieb, a former agency commissioner, said on CNBC. Under F.D.A. ethics rules,
staff members who are interviewing for jobs cannot do agency review work on
products by companies where they are seeking employment — or for a competitor.
Dr. Gottlieb also said cuts to the office of generic drug policy wiped out employees
with expertise in determining which brand-name drugs are eligible to be made as
lower-cost generics, calling those job eliminations “profound.” Approving generic
drugs can save consumers billions of dollars.
Support staff for inspectors investigating food and drug plants overseas were also
cut, raising security concerns. Dozens of workers who lost their jobs attended to
security monitoring to ensure that inspectors were safe, especially in hostile
nations.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/health/fda-food-safety-trump-layoffs.html
Jack Ewing,NYT,1,Business,5/3/2025,Car Prices Expected to Rise as Tariffs on Parts Kick In,"The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts on Saturday
that could sharply raise prices for new and used vehicles as well as for repairs and
insurance.
The latest tariffs, which President Trump ordered in March as part of his plan to
promote domestic manufacturing, come after the 25 percent levies on imported
cars that took effect in early April.
This second round of duties on imported parts will have a broader impact because
even cars made in the United States often have engines, transmissions, batteries or
other components produced in other countries.
The administration said on Tuesday that the tariffs were intended “to protect
national security by incentivizing domestic automobile production and reducing
American reliance on imports of foreign automobiles and their parts.”
Want to stay updated on what’s happening in Canada, China and
Mexico? Sign up for Your Places: Global Update, and we’ll send our
latest coverage to your inbox.
The tariffs on parts will not apply to components from Canada or Mexico as long as
those goods meet the requirements of a North American trade agreement
negotiated during Mr. Trump’s first term. Among other things, that deal requires
that a minimum percentage of the content of auto parts come from within North
America.
The administration also said that imported auto parts would not be subjected to
other levies, like the ones on aluminum and steel. And companies that made cars in
the United States would be exempted for two years from having to pay a portion of
the tariffs for imported parts.
Mr. Trump’s tariffs have already pushed up new car prices as customers flocked to
dealerships to buy vehicles before the levies took effect. The tariffs are having a
ripple effect on the used car market as more people look for affordable alternatives
to new cars, increasing demand and prices.

to bring down.
The president has insisted that the tariffs will bring manufacturing back to the
United States. But even if that policy succeeds, consumers will still pay more for
cars. Many goods, including lots of auto parts, can often be made much more
cheaply in China, Mexico or other countries outside the United States.
“A lot of parts, like fasteners, washers, carpet, wiring looms are just not available —
we can’t even buy those parts here,” Jim Farley, the chief executive of Ford Motor,
told CNN this week.
Automakers and suppliers say it will take years for them to relocate assembly
lines. And they are unlikely to commit billions of dollars to domestic manufacturing
because of uncertainty about the direction of trade policy.
Mr. Trump has frequently changed his mind about the size of tariffs and how they
should be applied. On Tuesday, he modified some of the rules to allow automakers
to avoid paying duties on a portion of the components they import for two years.
The measures provide the industry some relief, but car prices will still rise by
thousands of dollars, analysts said.
There will be unpredictable side effects. The financial stress could drive some
suppliers out of business, creating parts shortages.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct
financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
“Auto suppliers are already at thin margins,” said Lenny LaRocca, U.S. automotive
industry leader at the consulting firm KPMG. “They can’t afford the full cost of 25
percent tariffs.”
Mr. Trump’s decision to exempt many parts from Canada and Mexico will, however,
ease the burden on some companies.
The auto industry accounts for about 5 percent of Mexico’s gross domestic product
and employs around one million people in the country. Vehicles and parts are by far
Mexico’s largest exports to the United States.
“Little by little, this haze is clearing up,” Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s economy
minister, said at an event with business leaders and diplomats on Wednesday.
“What we are going to face is a situation that is not as disadvantageous as perhaps
many expected it to be.”
In Canada, however, many parts makers supply car factories in that country, said
Flavio Volpe, the president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association.
And the vehicles those plants make will still be hit with tariffs when they are
exported to the United States.
“The health of the Canadian auto parts sector is that there is a cluster of
manufacturing that we can supply locally,” Mr. Volpe said.
On Friday General Motors said that because of tariffs it was eliminating a third
shift at a pickup truck assembly line in Oshawa, Ontario. That plant will now build
more trucks for Canadians, the company said. Unifor, which represents
autoworkers in Canada, said the reduction would eliminate about 700 union jobs
and was likely to cause parts makers to lay off another 1,200 people.
Prime Minister Mark Carney said that G.M.’s decision was a “terrible
manifestation” of the economic crisis Mr. Trump’s tariffs had created for Canada.
The tariffs will hit some carmakers harder than others. Tesla and Ford are
somewhat less vulnerable. Tesla manufactures all of the cars it sell in the United
States in California and Texas. Ford says that it makes nearly 80 percent of the
vehicles it sells in the United States domestically, including F-series pickups, which
are the best selling vehicles in the country.
General Motors will suffer more, analysts say, because imported parts account for
a large proportion of the value of Chevrolets or Cadillacs made in the United States.
G.M. also imports cars from Canada, Mexico and South Korea. G.M. disputed that
assertion, saying that 80 percent of its parts will be exempt from tariffs.
Volvo Cars, which has a factory in South Carolina but uses many parts from China,
will also be hard hit, analysts say.
Even companies that make vehicles in the United States will feel the pain. Rivian
builds electric pickups in Illinois, but imports batteries from South Korea and
China that will be subject to tariffs.
The tariffs are expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles. Nearly 80
percent of cars priced at less than $30,000 will be subject to 25 percent tariffs,
including popular vehicles like the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Chevrolet Trax,
according to Cox Automotive.
Car prices will probably not skyrocket immediately, because most carmakers and
their dealers have large inventories of cars manufactured before the tariffs took
effect. Ford, Hyundai and Volkswagen are among carmakers that have said they
will not raise prices for several months. But carmakers are not profitable enough to
absorb the increased cost of tariffs indefinitely.
Administration officials continue to discuss tariffs with automakers and the duties
could change. But the uncertainty is creating huge headaches for carmakers. G.M.
said on Thursday that the tariffs would cost it up to $5 billion this year. Other
companies like Stellantis and Mercedes-Benz have told investors they can no
longer make reliable predictions about sales and profit for 2025.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/business/trump-auto-parts-tariffs.html
Natasha Singer,NYT,1,Business,5/2/2025,Google Plans to Roll Out Gemini A.I. Chatbot to Children Under 13,"Google plans to roll out its Gemini artificial intelligence chatbot next week for
children under 13 who have parent-managed Google accounts, as tech companies
vie to attract young users with A.I. products.
“Gemini Apps will soon be available for your child,” the company said in an email
this week to the parent of an 8-year-old. “That means your child will be able to use
Gemini” to ask questions, get homework help and make up stories.
The chatbot will be available to children whose parents use Family Link, a Google
service that enables families to set up Gmail and opt into services like YouTube for
their child. To sign up for a child account, parents provide the tech company with
personal data like their child’s name and birth date.
Gemini has specific guardrails for younger users to hinder the chatbot from
producing certain unsafe content, said Karl Ryan, a Google spokesman. When a
child with a Family Link account uses Gemini, he added, the company will not use

that data to train its A.I.
Introducing Gemini for children could accelerate the use of chatbots among a
vulnerable population as schools, colleges, companies and others grapple with the
effects of popular generative A.I. technologies. Trained on huge amounts of data,
these systems can produce humanlike text and realistic-looking images and videos.
Google and other A.I. chatbot developers are locked in a fierce competition to
capture young users. President Trump recently urged schools to adopt the tools for
teaching and learning. Millions of teenagers are already using chatbots as study
aids, writing coaches and virtual companions. Children’s groups warn the chatbots
could pose serious risks to child safety. The bots also sometimes make stuff up.
UNICEF, the United Nation’s children’s agency, and other children’s groups have
noted that the A.I. systems could confuse, misinform and manipulate young
children who may have difficulty understanding that the chatbots are not human.
“Generative A.I. has produced dangerous content,” UNICEF’s global research
office said in a post on A.I. risks and opportunities for children.
Google acknowledged some risks in its email to families this week, alerting parents
that “Gemini can make mistakes” and suggesting they “help your child think
critically” about the chatbot.
The email also recommended parents teach their child how to fact-check Gemini’s
answers. And the company suggested parents remind their child that “Gemini isn’t
human” and “not to enter sensitive or personal info in Gemini.”
Despite the company’s efforts to filter inappropriate material, the email added,
children “may encounter content you don’t want them to see.”
A Google email to parents this week
warned about the risks of Gemini for
children.
Over the years, tech giants have developed a variety of products, features and
safeguards for teens and children. In 2015, Google introduced YouTube Kids, a
stand-alone video app for children that is popular among families with toddlers.
Other efforts to attract children online have prompted concerns from government
officials and children’s advocates. In 2021, Meta halted plans to introduce an
Instagram Kids service — a version of its Instagram app intended for those under
the age of 13 — after the attorneys general of several dozen states sent a letter to
the company saying the firm had “historically failed to protect the welfare of
children on its platforms.”
Some prominent tech companies — including Google, Amazon and Microsoft —
have also paid multimillion-dollar fines to settle government complaints that they
violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. That federal law requires
online services aimed at children to obtain a parent’s permission before collecting
personal information, like a home address or a selfie, from a child under 13.
Under the Gemini rollout, children with family-managed Google accounts would
initially be able to access the chatbot on their own. But the company said it would
alert parents and that parents could then manage their child’s chatbot settings,
“including turning access off.”
“Your child will be able to access Gemini Apps soon,” the company’s email to
parents said. “We’ll also let you know when your child accesses Gemini for the first
time.”
Mr. Ryan, the Google spokesman, said the approach to providing Gemini for young
users complied with the federal children’s online privacy law.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/technology/google-gemini-ai-chatbot-kids.html
Ana Swanson;Jonathan Swan,NYT,1,Business,4/25/2025,China Rejects Trump Claim of Tariff Talks With Xi,"President Trump, whose trade war with China has rattled financial markets and
threatened to disrupt huge swaths of trade, suggested on Friday that he had been
in touch with Xi Jinping, China’s president, even as Chinese officials insisted that
no negotiations were occurring.
In an interview with Time on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said Mr. Xi had called him,
though he declined to say when, and asserted that his team was in active talks with
China on a trade deal. Asked about the interview outside the White House on
Friday morning, the president reiterated that he had spoken with the Chinese
president “numerous times,” but he refused to answer when pressed on whether
any call had happened after he imposed tariffs this month.
Trump Claims He’s Negotiating With China on
Trade. China Says Otherwise.

Mr. Trump’s comments appeared aimed at creating the impression of progress with
China to soothe jittery financial markets, which have fallen amid signs that the
world’s largest economies are in a standoff. The S&P 500 is down 10 percent since
Mr. Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration.
But the president’s claims of talks have been rejected by Chinese officials, who
have repeatedly denied this week that they are actively negotiating with the United
States.
“China and the U.S. have not held consultations or negotiations on the issue of
tariffs,” Guo Jiakun, the spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, said in a news
conference on Friday. “The United States should not confuse the public.”
Chinese officials have repeatedly said the United States should stop threatening
China and engage in dialogue on the basis of equality and respect. On Thursday, He
Yadong, a spokesman for China’s Commerce Ministry, said there were “no
economic and trade negotiations between China and the United States.”
“Any claims about progress in China-U.S. economic and trade negotiations are
baseless rumors without factual evidence,” he said. The Chinese Embassy in
Washington declined to comment on Friday.

“As we have always stated, President Trump’s team continues to correspond with
their Chinese counterparts,” said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press
secretary. “The president remains optimistic about securing a fair trade deal with
China.”
Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese imports to a minimum of 145 percent this
month, in a bid to force China into trade negotiations. But Chinese officials
responded by issuing their own tariffs on American products and clamping down
on exports to the United States of minerals and magnets that are necessary for
many industries, including the defense sector.
The Chinese also appear to have ignored Mr. Trump’s suggestions that the best
way to resolve the issue would be for Mr. Xi to get in touch with him directly. With
the two governments at an impasse, businesses that rely on sourcing products
from China — varying from hardware stores to toymakers — have been thrown
into turmoil. The triple-digit tariff rates have forced many to halt shipments
entirely.
Trump officials have admitted that the status quo with China on trade is not
sustainable, and some have considered paring back levies on the country. But the
White House insists it will not do that unless a deal is reached for China to do the
same.
Asked in the Time interview if he would call Mr. Xi if the Chinese leader did not call
first, Mr. Trump said no.
“We’re meeting with China,” he said. “We’re doing fine with everybody.”
Mr. Trump also said, without evidence, that he had “made 200 deals.” He claimed
that he would finish and announce them in the next three to four weeks.
Mr. Trump announced higher “reciprocal” tariffs on nearly 60 countries at the
beginning of April. The White House has since said it received requests from
dozens of countries to negotiate trade terms, and Peter Navarro, the White House
trade adviser, has said the administration would strike “90 deals in 90 days.”
Ms. Leavitt said this week that the Trump administration had received 18 proposals
on paper and that the trade team was “meeting with 34 countries this week alone.”
But many trade experts have expressed skepticism, given that past U.S. trade
deals have taken on average over a year to negotiate.
The president told Time that trade with countries like China had been unfair and
needed to be changed. “You can’t let them make a trillion dollars from us,” he said.
Mr. Trump said he would look individually at companies seeking exemptions from
tariffs. He also said he had a list of products that would be fine to import. “There
are some products I really don’t want to make here,” he said.
But Mr. Trump insisted that tariffs were encouraging companies to move back to
the United States, and that he would consider having high tariffs a year from now a
“total victory” because the country would be “making a fortune.”
“This is a tremendous success,” he said. “You just don’t know it yet.”
In public, Mr. Trump has been saying that his tariffs are working out well, that
countries are coming to him begging for deals and that everything will work out
beautifully for the American people.
In private, the president’s team has been less cheery. Major retailers have briefed
Mr. Trump on their expectations for empty store shelves if his tariffs are kept in
place. His top economic advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce
Secretary Howard Lutnick, were so alarmed by the sell-off in the bond markets,
and the potential for a widespread financial panic, that they urged Mr. Trump to
put a 90-day pause on his reciprocal tariffs two weeks ago.
Since then, his team has focused on how to de-escalate his trade war with China
without appearing to have capitulated.
Mr. Trump and some of his advisers believed that the Chinese economy would be
highly vulnerable to U.S. tariffs, given the country’s dependence on exporting to
the United States. But they appear to have misunderstood the extent of the
president’s leverage over Mr. Xi.
Chinese officials have made clear, through their statements to the news media, that
they have not appreciated the bullying tone from Mr. Trump and that any
negotiations need to be run through a formal process.
Beijing has also carefully censored and curated information in China about the
trade war, and emphasized the country’s resilience and ability to withstand pain.
Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has seen his poll numbers drop. His approval rating on the
economy — always a strength for him — has now become a weakness. Republican
lawmakers fear a wipeout in the 2026 midterms, compounding the pressure on Mr.
Trump to make deals that will restore a sense of economic well-being.
Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and the former
head of the China division for the International Monetary Fund, said both countries
seemed to recognize the need to begin negotiations but each wanted to initiate
them on their own terms.
“The narrative in Beijing seems to have shifted in recent days, with policymakers
there stiffening their backs and feeling that they can ride this out,” he said. “Their
perception seems to be that the Trump team will come to them as the U.S. economy
is suffering proportionately more damage from the escalating trade war.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/trump-china-tariffs-xi-jinping.html
Tony Romm,NYT,1,Business,5/2/2025,Trump Proposes $163 Billion in Cuts Across Government in New Budget,"President Trump on Friday proposed slashing $163 billion in federal spending next
fiscal year, a drastic retrenchment in the role and reach of government that, if
enacted, would eliminate a vast set of climate, education, health and housing
programs, including some that benefit the poor.
Issuing his first budget proposal since returning to office, Mr. Trump sketched out a
dim view of Washington. His blueprint depicted many core government functions
as woke, weaponized, wasteful or radical, as the president looked to justify his
request that Congress chop domestic spending to its lowest level in the modern
era.
Record-Low Funding for Domestic Programs
President Trump’s budget proposes shrinking nondefense funding to its lowest level since
the 1960s, when these records began.

Mr. Trump proposed cutting funding for some federal law enforcement, including
the F.B.I. He called on lawmakers to slash money meant to police tax evasion at the
Internal Revenue Service. He recommended striking billions in funds that help
finance clean water projects. And the president reserved some of his deepest cuts
for education, health and science, including the National Institutes of Health and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which would see their budgets cut
by around half.
Democrats immediately rebuked Mr. Trump for his proposal. Senator Chuck
Schumer of New York, the Senate minority leader, called it “heartless” and an “all-
out assault on hardworking Americans.” Even some Republicans took issue with
Mr. Trump’s budget, although others, like Speaker Mike Johnson, endorsed the
blueprint.
Mr. Trump also asked Congress to reduce, if not eliminate, billions of dollars in
federal aid to help the poorest Americans. For one, the White House called for
reconfiguring federal programs that provide rental assistance to low-income
families, cutting aid by more than $26 billion next fiscal year. And the
administration proposed the termination of a federal initiative, backed by some
Republicans, that aids needy families in paying their monthly heating bills.
In one of the few spending increases included in the budget, Mr. Trump asked
lawmakers to bolster spending at the Department of Homeland Security by more
than $43 billion, furthering his work to crack down on immigration, conduct

deportations and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. The president also
requested more than $1 trillion for the military next fiscal year.
But he asked lawmakers to approve that increase essentially on a one-time basis,
as part of a broader legislative package — due later this year — meant to advance
the president’s tax agenda. The approach angered some Republicans, who signaled
they would pursue a larger increase to military spending as part of the yearly
process to fund government agencies and programs.
“It is peculiar how much time the president’s advisers spend talking about
restoring peace through strength, given how apparently unwilling they’ve been to
invest accordingly in the national defense or in other critical instruments of
national power,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republicans’
former Senate leader, in a statement that denounced the administration’s
“accounting gimmicks.”
For Mr. Trump, the budget served to formalize his conservative vision and his
disruptive reorganization of the government, a campaign that has already
shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of federal workers without the
explicit approval of Congress.
Some of Mr. Trump’s proposed military increases could benefit Elon Musk, the tech
billionaire who has advised Mr. Trump on cost-cutting as part of the Department of
Government Efficiency
Mr. Trump’s budget supported the creation of a new missile defense shield and a
renewed campaign for “U.S. space dominance.” Both are areas in which Mr. Musk
and his rocket company, SpaceX, could stand to win major contracts funded by any
increase in spending.
Proposed Budget Change by Agency

In a letter Friday accompanying the spending blueprint, Russell T. Vought, the
leader of the White House budget office, said the administration had produced its
submission after a “rigorous, line-by-line review of spending.”
Mr. Vought added that the president sought to root out money “contrary to the
needs of ordinary working Americans and tilted toward funding niche,
nongovernmental organizations and institutions of higher education committed to
radical gender and climate ideologies antithetical to the American way of life.”
Sharon Parrott, the president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, said many of the budget changes contemplated by Mr. Trump still
seemed most likely to fall hardest on low-income Americans, particularly those
who rely on government services.
“This is the latest repudiation of some of what he promised on the campaign trail,
in terms of being a president who was going to seek to serve people struggling at
the margins of the economy,” she said.

Mr. Trump’s proposal is not law. Totaling about $1.7 trillion, after accounting for the
full set of spending changes the president seeks, the budget serves only as a formal
guide to Congress, where it immediately generated opposition.
“President Trump has made his priorities clear as day: He wants to outright
defund programs that help working Americans while he shovels massive tax
breaks at billionaires like himself and raises taxes on middle-class Americans with
his reckless tariffs,” Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the leading Democrat on
the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.
The criticism was not limited to Democrats, as Republicans also raised alarm about
cuts to some programs that serve the neediest Americans. Outlining her “serious
objections,” Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who leads the
Appropriations Committee, added in a statement: “Ultimately, it is Congress that
holds the power of the purse.”
By releasing the budget, Mr. Trump set the stage for what is bound to be a
complicated, monthslong process to fund the government and avert a shutdown
before an existing spending deal expires on Sept. 30. Entering that fight, many
Republicans have echoed Mr. Trump’s desire to slash federal spending, though
warring G.O.P. factions have disagreed at times over the exact scope.
Party lawmakers have also raced to identify potentially trillions of dollars in cuts
that they can include to finance a related package that would expand a set of
expiring tax cuts for families and businesses, one of the president’s signature —
and costliest — economic policy priorities.
But Mr. Trump’s proposal carries additional significance. He and his top budget
adviser, Mr. Vought, subscribe to the idea that the commander in chief wields
expansive authority to halt or cancel spending, even if Congress instructs
otherwise. Their view has paved the way for the administration to slow, freeze or
cancel billions of dollars in funds, sparking a vast array of lawsuits and prompting
more than three dozen ongoing federal investigations into their activities.
On Friday, Mr. Trump’s proposal left unanswered some of the most important
questions facing Washington and its finances. It was silent on the nation’s fiscal
trajectory, even as the president seeks to cut taxes in a sprawling and costly
legislative package that carries substantial implications for the nation’s $36 trillion
debt.
“It remains to be seen what the rest of the president’s proposals will hold, and
there is still the multitrillion-dollar question of whether the reconciliation bill will
blow up the debt,” said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a
Responsible Federal Budget, a group that advocates deficit reduction.
Nor did the president’s new budget address the future of the federal benefit
programs, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, that comprise the
largest share of federal spending annually. Some Republicans are particularly
interested in rethinking Medicaid, which provides health insurance to poor
families, as a source of savings to pay for their tax cuts.
The administration is expected to send those details in a fuller budget to Congress
as soon as this month.

Christine Chung,NYT,1,Business,5/2/2025,Newark Airport Is Experiencing Major Flight Delays. What’s Causing Them?,"Flying into or out of Newark Liberty International Airport has brought plenty of
misery in the last week, with cancellations, delays stretching well past five hours
and flight diversions that have stranded travelers far from their destinations.
Passengers are reporting on social media that they have missed flights and spent
hours stuck on the tarmac aboard planes. Some are still struggling to make new
travel arrangements.
The disruptions, which stretched into Friday with delays averaging over two hours,
have highlighted ongoing air traffic control staffing issues. The troubles prompted
United Airlines, Newark’s largest carrier, to cut nearly three dozen round-trip
flights per day at the hub beginning this weekend, the carrier’s chief executive,
Scott Kirby, announced on Friday.

Newark Airport?

Here’s what anyone heading to Newark Airport needs to know.
Air traffic control staffing is limiting capacity
Last summer, management of the airspace surrounding Newark shifted from New
York to Philadelphia. This move, which involved relocating at least a dozen air
traffic controllers, was meant to ease air traffic delays.
The Federal Aviation Administration has attributed this week’s flight disruptions at
Newark to equipment failures and unspecified staffing issues at the Philadelphia
air traffic control center as well as to construction on one of Newark’s runways.
These ongoing staffing issues are “effectively limiting the capacity of Newark
Airport,” said Aidan O’Donnell, the general manager of New Jersey airports at the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The other major New York City airports, Kennedy and LaGuardia, are managed by
the New York control center.
One of Newark’s runways is closed
A planned runway rehabilitation project has left Newark Airport with just two
operating runways, a situation that staffing shortages at the Philadelphia air traffic

One of the airport’s three runways was shut down on April 15 for rehabilitation and
repaving, with plans to reopen in mid-June.
This is a “very routine construction project,” said Mr. O’Donnell, and the airport
had prepared for it extensively by taking steps such as scheduling fewer flights
during this period.
Times travel coverage. When our writers review a destination, they do not accept
free or discounted services or, in most cases, reveal that they work for The Times.
We want their experience to be what you can expect.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Though the airport has two remaining open runways, the F.A.A. has underutilized
one of them during the closure, Mr. O’Donnell said. “When we only have one
runway that’s available, we are simultaneously landing and departing on the same
runway, which is the least efficient way that traffic can be managed into and out of
Newark,” he added.
The airport has more than 1,000 scheduled arrivals and departures each day, the
majority of which are operated by United.
The wave of disruptions that started on Monday has only
intensified
The Philadelphia control center experienced telecommunications and equipment
issues on Monday, an F.A.A. spokesperson said. That led to hundreds of delays and
cancellations and three dozen flight diversions that day, Mr. O’Donnell said. He
added that for two hours on Monday afternoon, no flights departed from or landed
at Newark.
The disruptions continued through the week as air traffic controller shortages
worsened in Philadelphia. Scott Kirby, the chief executive of United Airlines, said in
a letter to customers that more than 20 percent of the air traffic controllers
responsible for Newark “walked off the job” this week.
Mr. Kirby added that staffing shortages at the Philadelphia control center have
been a problem for years.
A spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association declined to
comment.
The problems may persist for weeks or months
The next few weeks could be challenging, Mr. O’Donnell warned.
Mass flight delays and cancellations can take days to resolve, as airlines navigate
getting passengers, crew and aircraft back on track. Both United and JetBlue
Airways have issued flight waivers allowing travelers to rebook without incurring
extra fees.
United will cut 35 out of an average of 328 round-trip flights per day from its
Newark schedule starting this weekend. The airport, one of the airline’s seven
hubs, is a key gateway for flying to Europe, India and the Middle East.
Without enough controllers, “Newark airport cannot handle the number of planes
that are scheduled to operate there in the weeks and months ahead,” Mr. Kirby
said, adding that the flight reduction was a stopgap measure “since there is no way
to resolve the near-term structural F.A.A. staffing issues.”

Stacy Cowley,NYT,1,Business,4/27/2025,New Details Emerge on Trump Officials’ Sprint to Gut Consumer Bureau Staff,"Two weeks ago, a three-judge panel from the federal appeals court in Washington
lifted a freeze on firing employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,
with some conditions. The judges, ruling on a Friday night, said that workers could
be fired if agency leaders determined, after a careful assessment, that they were
not needed to carry out the bureau’s legally required responsibilities.
Within hours, Trump administration officials — working closely with Elon Musk’s
associates at the Department of Government Efficiency — scurried to fire nearly
all the agency’s employees. By the following Thursday afternoon, bureau leaders
sent termination notices to nearly 1,500 employees, retaining barely 200 people,
and ordered that the fired workers’ access to agency systems be shut down the
next day.
A judge has again stopped the cuts for now. But the details of what happened at the
agency, which oversees banks and lenders and enforces consumer protection laws,
will be vital to determining if the firings can proceed. Hundreds of pages of newly
released agency records, supplemented by narrative accounts filed in court by
more than 20 agency employees, were submitted ahead of a hearing this week
before Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the Federal District Court in Washington.
Judge Jackson halted the planned firings less than a day after the notices went out,
saying that they went far beyond what the appeals court had allowed. Starting
Tuesday, she will hold a two-day hearing to take witness testimony and decide
whether to extend her order blocking the firings.
The consumer bureau has been on life support since February, when Trump
officials arrived at the agency and began dismantling it. A series of federal court
rulings prohibited the agency’s destruction. Congress created the agency in 2011 to
add safeguards around mortgages and other consumer financial products, and only
Congress has the power to abolish it.
Mark Paoletta, the agency’s chief legal officer and the mastermind behind the
termination plan, defended the firings, saying in a legal filing that they would
“right-size” an agency filled with “vast waste.” Russell Vought, the White House
budget office director who also serves as the bureau’s acting director, has called the
bureau a “woke and weaponized” agency.
But firing so many workers at once, with no transition period, would destroy the
bureau’s ability to operate, employees warned their bosses in emails, chat
messages and verbal conversations, according to court records. Within days,
critical technical systems would fail, enforcement lawyers would miss court
deadlines and agency data that federal courts had ordered be preserved would be
lost, they said.
“I don’t think we can keep operating even for 60 days without keeping many of
these folks,” Christopher Chilbert, the bureau’s chief information officer, wrote in an
email the day the terminations were announced.
Adam Martinez, the agency’s chief operating officer, responded: “Understood and I
do not disagree. We will really need to spend the next week figuring out a path
forward.”
Judge Jackson has asked for the testimony of Gavin Kliger, a 25-year-old associate
of Mr. Musk’s who carried out the terminations.
Are you a federal worker? We want to hear from you.
The Times would like to hear about your experience as a federal worker under the second
Trump administration. We may reach out about your submission, but we will not publish
any part of your response without contacting you first.
Mr. Kliger, a former Twitter summer intern who had no experience in government
work before this year, joined the Office of Personnel Management in January as a
senior adviser. He has carried out assignments for Mr. Musk’s Department of
Government Efficiency, or DOGE, in at least nine agencies, including the Internal
Revenue Service, where he is said to have been recently ousted from.
Emails sent in the hours after the appeals court ruled that staff cuts could move
forward show Mr. Musk’s officials scrambling to fire people as quickly as possible
— at times moving so fast they appeared to forget which agency they were focused
on.
Jeremy Lewin, a 28-year-old lawyer who leads DOGE’s State Department foreign
aid actions, sent an email on Saturday from his U.S. Agency for International
Development email address laying the groundwork for the reduction in force, the
government’s version of a layoff. In a nod to specific language in the appellate
court’s order, Mr. Lewin wrote, “Director Vought’s team and I will conduct an
individualized assessment to, consistent with the DC Circuit’s stay, ensure that only
nonstatutory positions are affected.”
Mr. Paoletta said in court filings that he worked with two other lawyers to conduct
a unit-by-unit evaluation of the consumer bureau and determined that the bureau
could function without 90 percent of its current staff.
“An approximately 200-person agency allows the bureau to fulfill its statutory
duties and better aligns with the new leadership’s priorities and management
philosophy,” he said.
But emails and other agency records show that up until nearly the moment the
termination notices were sent, bureau officials were still debating the numbers. On
the Tuesday before the notices went out, some workers trying to prepare materials
believed 485 workers would remain.
Trump officials wanted those slated for termination to be cut off from the agency’s
systems less than 24 hours after receiving their layoff notice. One human resources
worker involved in the planning asked a manager how people who were traveling
and unable to check their email before losing access would be notified of their
firing.
“Many people have asked that question. No one making decisions really cares,” the
manager responded. “It makes me sad.”
In legal declarations totaling more than 100 pages, department heads — who said
they were not consulted by the Trump officials before the firings — and other
workers depicted the terminations as reckless and riddled with errors.
The one person Mr. Paoletta left in the Office of Servicemember Affairs, a legally
required unit that aids military workers, had already accepted the government’s
deferred resignation offer and would be retiring in September. He had turned in his
work equipment and lost access to agency systems, workers said — meaning the
office would be unstaffed if the firings proceeded.
The head of another legally required department said that he and all of his workers
had received termination notices, despite Mr. Paoletta’s testimony that one worker
had been retained.
“If there is such a person, that person has not reached out to me or, to my
knowledge, to anyone else in my office to understand how we fulfill our statutory
mandate,” the department head said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/business/cfpb-layoffs-trump-musk-doge.html
Benjamin Mullin,NYT,1,Business,5/2/2025,Trump’s Order to Cut Funding for NPR and PBS Draws Fiery Pushback,"President Trump’s executive order to defund NPR and PBS was met with fiery
pushback on Friday, as the organizations challenged the legality of the move and
said it could jeopardize access to vital information.
The order issued late Thursday instructed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
which receives and distributes over $500 million in taxpayer money to public TV
and radio stations annually, to eliminate millions of dollars in federal funding to the
two public media organizations. It amounts to perhaps the most significant threat
in a decades-long campaign by Republicans to weaken NPR and PBS.
Patricia Harrison, the chief executive of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a
private company, said in a statement that the White House had no legal authority
over the company. NPR vowed to challenge the order, calling it “an affront to the
First Amendment.”
Paula Kerger, the chief executive of PBS, also called Mr. Trump’s executive order
illegal. “The president’s blatantly unlawful executive order, issued in the middle of
the night, threatens our ability to serve the American public with educational
programming, as we have for the past 50-plus years,” Ms. Kerger said.
NPR and PBS Vow to Fight Trump’s Order to
Cut Funding
Mr. Trump and other Republicans have long argued that NPR and PBS have a
liberal bias and that taxpayers should not fund their journalism as a result. The
executive order echoed those arguments, saying NPR and PBS do not present “a
fair, accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events.”
Mr. Trump’s executive order was the fourth effort by Republicans to weaken public
media in as many months: A bill is working its way through Congress to defund
NPR and PBS; the White House asked Congress on Friday to reduce federal
funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting; and this week, Mr. Trump
sought to fire three directors from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a move
that was delayed by the courts.
The president’s order on Thursday also instructed federal agencies to cut any
funding to NPR and PBS. Some federal agencies, such as the Department of
Education, have historically awarded grants to public media outlets.
The change, if it survives a legal challenge, would have significant effects on NPR
and PBS, though those organizations could survive without government funding.
Roughly 2 percent of NPR’s budget comes from federal grants; for PBS, that
number is around 16 percent. Both organizations receive government support
indirectly through dues and program licensing fees from their member stations.
But the executive order could fundamentally alter NPR’s and PBS’s relationships
with their member stations. For decades, local TV and radio stations across the
United States have used federal money to buy popular programming, like “All
Things Considered” from NPR and “PBS NewsHour.”
Mr. Trump’s order could forbid local stations to spend their money on those
programs, barring indirect federal support of those organizations, even if it does
not explicitly eliminate funding for local TV and radio stations scattered across the
United States, many of which rely on government support to survive.
It would probably not have immediate effect, since the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting has already distributed much of its money for 2025.
Amanda Mountain, the chief executive of Rocky Mountain Public Media in
Colorado, urged her members to stay informed, donate and speak up for public
broadcasting.
“Make your voice heard,” she wrote in an email obtained by The New York Times.
“If you value free, public‐service media, contact your representatives.”
Susan Goldberg, the president and chief executive of GBH, a public broadcaster in
Boston, said the loss of federal funding “would be a crippling blow for the millions
of people who rely on our services for news and education, especially children.”
Richard H. Pildes, a professor of constitutional law at the New York University
School of Law, said the executive order could run afoul of a federal law that
prohibited the president from rescinding federal funding without permission from
Congress.
“As a general matter, Congress controls the purse strings,” Professor Pildes said.
“The president doesn’t have the power to refuse to spend money that Congress has
appropriated for specific purposes.”
He also said it was unclear whether Mr. Trump had the authority to order the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting to do anything, since it is a private,
nongovernmental entity.
A spokeswoman for the White House did not respond to a request for comment.
The specter of defunding has loomed over public media organizations for so long
that executives have developed contingency plans. In 2011, NPR put together a
secret plan to assess what would happen if all federal funding was eliminated from
public media. According to the analysis, NPR could lose between $1 million and $27
million, with as many as 181 local stations shutting down. A contingency plan from
this spring called the prospect of total defunding “akin to an asteroid striking
without warning.”
Mr. Trump’s order came down just as public radio executives from across the
United States met in Washington for NPR’s spring board meeting. Katherine
Maher, the chief executive of NPR, addressed the order during the board meeting,
saying existing laws prevent any employee of the U.S. government from exercising
control over public broadcasting.
“We will strongly defend our work and the editorial independence of our journalists
and continue to tell the stories of the country with accuracy, objectivity, and
fairness,” Ms. Maher said.
A correction was made on May 2, 2025: An earlier version of this article incorrectly
stated that President Trump’s executive order targeting funding for NPR and PBS
accused them of producing “left-wing propaganda.” The order said the organizations
were biased, but did not use the phrase “left-wing propaganda.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/business/media/npr-pbs-federal-funding.html
Patricia Cohen,NYT,1,Business,4/28/2025,Why the Economic Disruption From Trump’s Tariff War Will Be Hard to Reverse,"President Trump has made clear his intent to smash the reigning global economic
order. And in 100 days, he has made remarkable progress in accomplishing that
goal.
Mr. Trump has provoked a trade war, scrapped treaties and suggested that
Washington might not defend Europe. He is also dismantling the governmental
infrastructure that has provided the know-how and experience.
The changes have been deep. But the world is still churning. Midterm elections in
two years could erode the Republican majority in Congress. And Mr. Trump’s reign
is constitutionally mandated to end in four years. Could the next president come in
and undo what the Trump administration has done?

As Cardinal Michael Czerny, a close aide to Pope Francis, said of the Catholic
Church: “There is nothing that we have done over 2,000 years that couldn’t be
rolled back.”
The same could be said of global geopolitics. Yet even at this early stage, historians
and political scientists agree that on some crucial counts, the changes wrought by
Mr. Trump may be hard to reverse.
Like the erosion of trust in the United States, a resource that took generations to
build.
“The MAGA base and JD Vance will still be around long after Trump’s gone,” said
Ian Goldin, professor of globalization and development at the University of Oxford.
No matter who occupies the White House next, the conditions that propelled the
“Make America Great Again” movement — widening inequality and economic
insecurity — remain. For the rest of the world, there is still a worry, he said, that
there could be “another Trump in the future.”
As a result, allies are working to strike trade partnerships and build security
alliances that exclude the United States. The European Union and South American
countries recently created one of the world’s largest trade zones.
The Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, recently proposed building new
transportation networks to ease access to global markets outside the United States.
Canada is also negotiating to join Europe’s military buildup to reduce its reliance
on the United States, while Britain and the European Union are working to finalize
a defense pact.

“The world moves on,” Mr. Goldin said. Supply chains will be rearranged, new
partnerships will be struck, and foreign students, researchers and tech talent will
find other places to migrate. “The U.S. is not going to quickly restore its economic
position,” he said.
“And it’s not just the United States that is so different now,” he added. Mr. Trump is
emboldening autocratic leaders around the world, which further chips away at the
rules-based system.

China’s top leader, Mr. Xi, is seeking to exploit Mr. Trump’s protectionist turn and
chaotic policy reversals to better position Beijing as the defender of free trade and
the new leader of the global trading system.
Mr. Xi’s argument particularly resonates among many emerging economies in
Latin America, Asia and Africa. China looks “steady and stable and a picture of
equanimity compared to the United States,” said Jonathan Czin, a fellow at the
Brookings Institution’s China Center and a former senior China analyst for the
Central Intelligence Agency.
Africa is a prime example. Mr. Trump has gutted the U.S. Agency for International
Development, which delivered food and health care to the world’s poorest. And the
reorganization plan for the State Department has proposed eliminating nearly all
diplomatic missions across the continent.
By comparison, China has already invested deeply in Africa as part of its Belt and
Road Initiative, and its push to control more of the continent’s critical minerals. “It
creates a vacuum that allows China to consolidate that position and control over
those mining rights,” Mr. Czin said.

Mr. Trump’s hostility to allies could also undercut government efforts in recent
years to keep advanced technology out of China’s hands. Those previously close
relations were crucial in persuading the Netherlands and Japan to halt exports of
advanced semiconductor equipment to China.
Antony Hopkins, a history professor at Cambridge University, added that Mr.
Trump was forgetting the important role China played as an international investor
and buyer of U.S. debt. If China’s access to America’s large consumer market is
severely curtailed, “you are courting the possibility of damaging China’s ability to
invest in U.S. Treasury bonds, and if you do that, you’re shooting yourself in the
foot.”
Another region caught between the United States and China is Southeast Asia. But
as Mr. Trump threatened, and then paused until early July, potentially ruinous
tariffs on the export-oriented economies of countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh and
Indonesia, China gained an opportunity to strengthen ties.

Finally, the evisceration of the federal government’s research and data collection
capabilities risks undermining America’s scientific excellence and competitive
edge. According to the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, the
federal government finances roughly 40 percent of the long-term basic research
that undergirds the country’s technological and scientific breakthroughs.
The administration is cutting billions of dollars in grants to universities, scientists
and researchers, undermining work on topics like environmental hazards, disease
control, climate and clean energy programs, computer processing, agriculture,
defense and artificial intelligence. It has slashed funding for the cybersecurity
work that protects the power grid, pipelines and telecommunications. Thousands of
veteran and up-and-coming experts have been fired.
Institutions are worried about a brain drain as American and foreign researchers
turn elsewhere for grants, jobs and academic freedom.
Nor would it be easy to quickly reconstitute the networks of people, assistance,
information and logistical know-how contained in agencies that have been
disbanded or emptied.
“This is a revolution dedicated to destroying not only policies but institutions,” Mr.
Schell at the Asia Society said. Even if the Democrats regain power, it’s not clear
“there will be a structure to revive or whether it will have to be arduously rebuilt.”
Sometimes a signature event like the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 serves as an
endpoint to an era. But it is not necessarily always clear in real time if stress on a
system is so extreme that it won’t be able to snap back.
Many people thought the “Nixon shock” represented such a break, David Ekbladh,
a history professor at Tufts University, said. In 1971 President Richard M. Nixon
terminated the system of fixed exchange rates and severed the value of the U.S.
dollar from gold.
The author William Greider called it the “precise date on which America’s singular
dominance” of the global economy ended. Chaos enveloped global markets, and
America’s allies worried that the president’s unilateral decision undermined the
postwar cooperative system. Still, the larger economic order held.
“The game changed, but it wasn’t a revolution,” Mr. Ekbladh said. Negotiations to
open markets continued, America’s alliances remained intact and the Group of 10
negotiated a new arrangement. Respect internationally for the rule of law
prevailed, and the United States was still universally seen as the leader of the free
world.
The question for the United States now is how deep support is for the system that
was, Mr. Ekbladh said. These currents of deep discontent with the global economy
have been bubbling up for a long time, and many people voted for Mr. Trump
because of his promise to upend the system. “Do the American people want this to
go away?”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/business/economy/trump-trade-global-economy.html
Stanley Reed,NYT,1,Business,5/3/2025,Why OPEC Plus Is Increasing Oil Supplies Despite Falling Prices,"Oil prices are falling. Economists are cutting forecasts for global economic growth.
Oil giants are reporting lower profits.
But on Saturday, eight countries that belong to the oil cartel known as OPEC Plus
said they would add about 411,000 barrels of oil a day in June. The move, which
follows a similar step by the group to increase oil production at their April meeting,
is a major shift in policy that will ripple through the wider energy industry, hitting
profits of oil companies and forcing cutbacks.
The group said in a statement that the market was “healthy” and noted that oil
inventories remained low.
Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC Plus, is signaling that it is reluctant to
hold back millions of barrels a day of oil that it could produce, especially when
other members of the group, like Kazakhstan and Iraq, are not observing their
agreed-upon production ceilings.
“The view from Saudi Arabia, in particular, is that they no longer want to be the
ones carrying the heaviest burden if other countries in the group are not showing
sufficient commitment to doing their part,” said Richard Bronze, the head of
geopolitics at Energy Aspects, a London research firm.
Demand for oil has not weakened significantly. Oil consumption increased by 1.2
million barrels a day in the first quarter of 2025, the most since 2023, according to
the International Energy Agency in Paris. Analysts there and elsewhere, though,
are cutting their forecasts for demand in anticipation of disruption from global
trade tensions, which has already slammed prices.
Prices of Brent crude, the international benchmark, have fallen close to 20 percent
since April 3, when the Saudis and other producers signaled they would increase
production.
The price of West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark, slipped this week
below $60 a barrel, a threshold where many producers can no longer make a profit,
and analysts say that prices could fall further. Under such pressures, producers
with higher costs, like shale drillers in the United States, which have been
increasing output in recent years while OPEC restrained production, may be forced
to cut back.
“To the extent that OPEC Plus cannot or will not reduce output at any time to
support prices, the burden of shoring them up would fall on other higher-cost
producers,” wrote analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, considered the main decision makers
among oil producers these days, may also be more inclined to bolster the ambitions
of President Trump, who is expected to visit Saudi Arabia and other Middle East
countries soon, than they were in aiding his predecessor, Joseph R. Biden Jr.
This price drop “represents one of the most important economic bright spots” for
the Trump administration, Helima Croft, head of global commodities at RBC
Capital Markets, an investment bank, wrote in a recent note to clients. Mr. Trump
has promised to lower energy costs, including gas prices, for consumers.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates may be hoping for some concessions in
deals in defense or artificial intelligence, where both countries have strong
ambitions, analysts say. Already, the Trump administration is reviving talks on a
nuclear partnership with Saudi Arabia.
Typically, OPEC Plus would be scrambling to cut supplies to bolster markets. Such
calculations have clearly changed among a smaller group of eight OPEC Plus
members, including Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates. They have
instead been unwinding an earlier agreement to restrain their production by about
2.2 million barrels a day.
Of late, this smaller group has been meeting to make deals, leaving the rest of
OPEC Plus in the rear seat. Saudi Arabia, which seems to be running the process, is
gaining the largest of the increases.
“It really comes down to whether Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are
willing to cut production further to support prices,” said Bhushan Bahree, an
executive director at S&P Global.
So far, the answer is no.
The United Arab Emirates is one of several producers, along with Kazakhstan and
Iraq, that has an interest in raising production to accommodate the added output
from oil and gas investments by international companies.
Kazakhstan produced about 400,000 barrels a day above its OPEC Plus ceiling in
March, according to the International Energy Agency. In the same period, Iraq
exceeded its ceiling by 440,000 barrels a day and the United Arab Emirates by
350,000.
Kazakhstan seems reluctant to rein in investors like Chevron and Exxon Mobil,
which recently spent tens of billions of dollars to raise production to one million
barrels a day at the Tengiz oil field in the country.
“We don’t engage in discussions about OPEC or OPEC Plus targets,” Mike Wirth,
Chevron’s chairman and chief executive, told analysts on Friday during an
earnings call. Mr. Wirth added that Tengiz was an important source of revenue for
the Kazakhstan government and had not been “curtailed” historically.
“We follow national interests, strictly observing our international obligations,” the
Kazakhstan Energy Ministry said in an emailed statement.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/business/opec-plus-oil-production-

The stock market recorded a weekly gain, as investors latch on to any signs of
easing trade tensions.
The S&P 500, which was roughly flat in early trading on Friday before rising 0.7
percent for the day, ended the week 4.6 percent higher. Still, the index remains
sharply lower since President Trump returned to office.
The stock market has seen dramatic swings in recent days, with Wall Street
grasping for scraps of information about tariffs, trade and other crucial issues that
can shift from day to day. Monday saw a sharp sell-off fueled by Mr. Trump’s
renewed attacks on Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, followed by
four days of sizable gains.
On Friday, jittery traders were confronted with the latest in a stream of
contradicting claims about trade negotiations and tariffs. The head of an American
business group in China said that the Chinese government was considering
exempting some products from its 125 percent retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.
Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said that
the commerce ministry had canvassed businesses in China to identify U.S. imports
that were crucial to supply chains and vulnerable to China’s new trade barriers.
For some companies, he said, “their business model would not work in China, and
we would see them exit” if the trade war persisted long-term.
Also on Friday, the Chinese government reiterated that it was not engaged in trade
negotiations with officials in Washington, pushing back against Mr. Trump’s claim
that the U.S.-China talks were underway. “The United States should not confuse the
public,” a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Mr. Trump
suggested in an interview with Time that he had been in touch with Xi Jinping,
China’s president, and asserted that his team was in active talks with China on a
trade deal.
your inbox.
The counterclaims followed reports in Chinese media outlets and on Chinese social
media this week that Beijing would forgo retaliatory tariffs on some U.S.-made
semiconductor-related products. The Chinese government has not announced any
such policy.
The New York Times heard from hundreds of American business owners who said
they had been stunned into paralysis by Mr. Trump’s barrage of tariffs. They are
reassessing their product lines and supply chains and even putting their operations
on hold. Businesses are rushing to cancel factory orders or halt shipping containers
before they leave China, pausing capital investments and new hiring, and scaling
back spending to the bare necessities.
In the United States, executives at consumer-oriented companies have said that
worries and uncertainty about the global economy are dampening spending. On
Thursday, PepsiCo cut its full-year guidance outlook, citing a reduction in
consumer spending as well as the impact of higher global tariffs. Procter &
Gamble, which makes household staples like Tide detergent, also cut its full-year
outlook and said whiplash on tariff policy had factored into a “pause” in
consumption.
“The consumer has been hit with a lot, and that’s a lot to process,” Andre Schulten,
P&G’s chief financial officer, told analysts, citing tariff uncertainty and
“divisiveness and nationalistic rhetoric.”
Indeed, on Friday came signs that Americans were feeling gloomier about the
economy. An updated University of Michigan measurement showed consumer
sentiment falling for the fourth consecutive month, with the looming effects of
tariffs weighing on American households. Expectations for future business and
finance conditions have fallen 32 percent since January, the survey found.
Some analysts cautioned that the stock market’s gains this week did not indicate
that the fundamental economic concerns that had fueled its volatility had been
resolved.
“The road back to record highs won’t be easy,” said Mark Hackett, the chief market
strategist at Nationwide. “Markets are showing resilience, but still face the same
persistent challenges, including tariff uncertainty and signs of an economic
slowdown.”
Elsewhere in the markets:
Markets in Asia were broadly higher, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 gaining 1.8 percent
and Taiwan’s benchmark index up 2 percent. In Europe, stocks gained ground.
Shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, rose 1.5 percent on Friday. On
Thursday, the technology giant reported a large jump in quarterly profit. The
tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3 percent on Friday.
The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds fell about five basis points, to 4.26 percent.
Oil futures wobbled, with Brent crude falling about 1 percent before inching
higher, to roughly $67 a barrel.

Amanda Holpuch,NYT,1,Business,4/27/2025,"Titanic Survivor’s Letter, Written Aboard the Ship, Sells for Nearly $400,000","Days before the Titanic struck an iceberg, a first-class passenger, Col. Archibald
Gracie, described the vessel in a letter written while on board: “It is a fine ship but
I shall await my journey’s end before I pass judgment on her.”
Colonel Gracie’s journey on the Titanic had a catastrophic end, but he fared better
than most.
He was on the top deck of the ship, gripping a railing, as it plunged into the sea. He
said he was “swirled” under water before he got to a raft, where he spent hours
floating on icy waters before being rescued.
The letter he wrote was sold on Saturday at an auction for $399,000 (or 300,000
pounds), according to Henry Aldridge and Son, an auction house in Wiltshire,
England.
The auction house said the letter, written in neat, cursive handwriting, was
addressed to an unidentified European ambassador, the great-uncle of the seller.
The letterhead shows a triangular red flag with a white star and is printed with the
words “On board R.M.S. Titanic.”
The letter was dated April 10, 1912, the day the ship set sail from Southampton,
England. On April 12, it was postmarked in London, where it was received at the
Waldorf Hotel. The Titanic struck an iceberg just before midnight on April 14 and
sank the next day.
The buyer of the letter was based in the United States, according to Andrew
Aldridge, the managing director of Henry Aldridge and Son. The auction house did
not publicly identify the buyer or the seller.
Mr. Aldridge said in an email that the stories of the ship’s passengers “are told
through the memorabilia” and that “their memories are kept alive through those
items.”
The auction house had initially expected the letter to sell for up to 60,000 pounds,
or nearly $80,000.
Colonel Gracie, a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point,
was a high-profile survivor of the Titanic disaster, in which about 1,500 people
perished.
He died eight months later, in December 1912, of complications from diseases, but
his doctors and his family said that the real cause was that he had never recovered
from the shock of the Titanic disaster, according to The New York Times.
After Colonel Gracie was rescued, he began work on “The Truth About the Titanic,”
a book about his experience that was published posthumously. The New York
Times review of the book said “there is something effective in the very lack of
directness and coherency in the narrative.”
Colonel Gracie said in an interview with The New York Tribune that he had been on
the top deck of the ship when it was hit by a wave that sent other people overboard.
He managed to stay on and grabbed a brass railing.
“When the ship plunged down, I was forced to let go, and I was swirled around and
around for what seemed an interminable time,” he said. “Eventually I came to the
surface to find the sea a mass of tangled wreckage.”
He said he grabbed a wooden grating and then saw a canvas-and-cork raft. He
made it onto the raft and began trying to rescue others. They eventually reached a
rescue ship, R.M.S. Carpathia.
“The hours that elapsed before we were picked up by the Carpathia were the
longest and most terrible that I ever spent,” Colonel Gracie said, according to The
Tribune. “Practically without any sensation of feeling because of the icy water, we
were almost dropping from fatigue.”
The letter sold at auction on Saturday for nearly $400,000
or 300,000 pounds. Henry Aldridge & Son
Colonel Gracie was an established figure in New York and Washington society.
His father had been an officer in the Confederate Army during the Civil War.
Colonel Gracie was also a descendant of Archibald Gracie, who built the New York
City mayor’s official residence, Gracie Mansion, in 1799.
After news of the Titanic’s sinking reached the United States, and it was not known
whether Colonel Gracie had survived, his wife, Constance Schack Gracie, was
reported missing for unrelated reasons.
Mrs. Gracie had not been on the ship, but had left town to avoid being subpoenaed
in the lunacy trial of another society woman, Mary E. Gage, according to The New
York Times.
In the days after the Titanic disaster, the Gracies’ daughter, Edith Gracie, was
asked about the whereabouts of her mother, which she said she did not know, and
about the fate of her father, The Times reported.
She said Colonel Gracie had been in Europe recuperating from an operation and
had said in a letter that he would return home with a much stronger constitution.
“It is too terrible to think of,” she said, “but I am hoping against hope that he has
come through the perils of the accident without harm.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/world/europe/titanic-survivor-letter-

Katie Thomas;Jessica Silver-Greenberg,NYT,1,Business,4/24/2025,Leaders of Mental Health Giant Promised Big Bonuses to Deal With Federal Investigations,"Last year was tough for Acadia Healthcare, one of the country’s largest providers
of mental health services.
A slew of federal agencies opened investigations into whether Acadia illegally held
patients against their will in its psychiatric hospitals, as described in a New York
Times investigation in September. The federal inquiries rattled investors, causing
Acadia’s stock to plummet.
But Acadia’s troubles have been a boon to the company’s chief executive,
Christopher Hunter. Its board of directors awarded him a $1.8 million bonus to help
respond to “unprecedented governmental inquiries,” according to a financial filing
this month. The bonus comes on top of his regular compensation, which totaled
more than $7 million in 2024.
Acadia’s chief financial officer and general counsel were also granted bonuses of
about $1 million, and the chief operating officer was promised $600,000. Acadia said
the bonuses, which will be paid in March of next year, were awarded to ensure that
the leaders did not leave before the investigations were completed.
The company’s board decided that keeping its leadership team was “in the best
long-term interest of the company and the patients and communities it serves,”
said Tim Blair, a spokesman for Acadia. “The company follows a pay-for-
performance philosophy, using peer market data for benchmarking and
calibration,” he added.
The Times reported that Acadia was holding patients against their will in order to
maximize insurance payouts. Some patients arrived at emergency rooms seeking
routine mental health care but were sent to Acadia facilities, where they were
locked inside and isolated from their families. The practices began before Mr.
Hunter became chief executive, in April 2022, but continued under his watch, The
Times found.

groundbreaking of a facility in Greenville, N.C., in 2023. WCTI News 12, via YouTube
The company has forcefully denied any misconduct and said it would cooperate
with the investigations. “The allegation that Acadia systematically holds patients
longer than medically necessary is false and goes directly against everything we
do and stand for when it comes to patient care,” Mr. Hunter told investors in
October.
After the article was published, Acadia told investors that several government
agencies, including the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, had begun investigations. In October, executives disclosed that
admissions to their facilities were not as high as expected. That same month,
shareholders brought a class-action lawsuit against the company, arguing that
Acadia concealed its practices from investors.
The Times also found problems in other parts of Acadia’s businesses, including its
methadone clinics, which were billing the government for services, like counseling,
that it did not provide. And inadequate staffing led to a series of tragedies at one of
the company’s prized women’s facilities, The Times reported Tuesday.
Since September, the company has lost roughly $5 billion of its market value and is
now worth about $2 billion.
Like many chief executives, Mr. Hunter’s compensation is tied in part to Acadia’s
share value. In 2024, the company’s falling stock led him to miss his performance
goals, which lowered his pay, according to the April filing.
But Sarah Anderson, an executive compensation analyst at the Institute for Policy
Studies, a left-leaning think tank, said that those incentives are undermined when
companies like Acadia give bonuses despite poor performance.
“The whole argument of tying your compensation to the stock price is so that the
executives will bear risk of their actions,” she said. “This is just going completely
against that.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/health/acadia-bonuses.html
Elizabeth Williamson,NYT,1,Business,4/24/2025,Elon Musk and DOGE’s Savings May Be Erased by New Costs,"President Trump and Elon Musk promised taxpayers big savings, maybe even a
“DOGE dividend” check in their mailboxes, when the Department of Government
Efficiency was let loose on the federal government. Now, as he prepares to step
back from his presidential assignment to cut bureaucratic fat, Mr. Musk has said
without providing details that DOGE is likely to save taxpayers only $150 billion.
That is about 15 percent of the $1 trillion he pledged to save, less than 8 percent of
the $2 trillion in savings he had originally promised and a fraction of the nearly $7
trillion the federal government spent in the 2024 fiscal year.
The errors and obfuscations underlying DOGE’s claims of savings are well
documented. Less known are the costs Mr. Musk incurred by taking what Mr.
Trump called a “hatchet” to government and the resulting firings, agency lockouts
and building seizures that mostly wound up in court.
The Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization that studies the
federal work force, has used budget figures to produce a rough estimate that
firings, re-hirings, lost productivity and paid leave of thousands of workers will cost
upward of $135 billion this fiscal year. At the Internal Revenue Service, a DOGE-
What Elon Musk Didn’t Budget For: Firing
Workers Costs Money, Too
driven exodus of 22,000 employees would cost about $8.5 billion in revenue in 2026
alone, according to figures from the Budget Lab at Yale University. The total
number of departures is expected to be as many as 32,000.
Neither of these estimates includes the cost to taxpayers of defending DOGE’s
moves in court. Of about 200 lawsuits and appeals related to Mr. Trump’s agenda,
at least 30 implicate the department.
“Not only is Musk vastly overinflating the money he has saved, he is not
accounting for the exponentially larger waste that he is creating,” said Max Stier,
the chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service. “He’s inflicted these costs
on the American people, who will pay them for many years to come.”
Mr. Stier and other experts on the federal work force said it did not have to be this
way. Federal law and previous government shutdowns offered Mr. Musk a legal
playbook for reducing the federal work force, a goal that most Americans support.
But Mr. Musk chose similar lightning-speed, blunt-force methods he used to
drastically cut Twitter’s work force after he acquired the company in 2022.

agency’s employees will cost about $8.5 billion in revenue in 2026 alone, according to an estimate. Haiyun

“The law is clear,” said Jeri Buchholz, who over three decades in public service
handled hiring and firing at seven federal agencies, including NASA and the
Defense Intelligence Agency. “They can do all the things they are currently doing,
but they can’t do them the way they’re doing them. They can either start over and
do it right, or they can be in court for forever.”
Harrison W. Fields, a White House spokesman, defended DOGE’s cuts and called
the $150 billion that the administration had saved “monumental and historic.”
“It’s important to realize that doing nothing has a cost, too, and these so-called
experts and groups are conveniently absent when looking at the costs of doing
nothing,” he said.
On the I.R.S., he said, “Every single cut has been done to make the government
more efficient and not to be a burden to the American people or cut any critical
resources or programs they rely on.”
Based on the latest available information, the DOGE cuts have targeted at least 12
percent of the 2.4 million civilian employees in the federal work force. But a wide
gap exists between DOGE’s planned cuts and the number of people who actually
leave.
Buyouts and firings initially trimmed about 100,000 workers — thousands fewer
people than those who typically retire in a year, according to Office of Personnel
Management figures. At least one-quarter of those 100,000 workers have been
rehired at full pay, most after judges ruled that their firings were illegal and some
after Mr. Musk said DOGE had “accidentally” sacked workers safeguarding
nuclear weapons, ensuring aviation safety and combating bird flu and Ebola.
When judges ordered that the workers be hired back, the government put them on
paid leave, meaning taxpayers would foot the cost of rehiring them, plus the
salaries they collected while staying home.
Layoffs of 10,000 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services
wiped out the entire team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
combating H.I.V. among mothers and children around the world. In an interview,
two public health physicians said they were caught off guard because the team’s
work always had bipartisan support. They were facing termination on June 2 and
said they wanted to return to work but did not know to whom to make their case.
Mr. Musk’s methods have cast a pall over the latest effort by an American
president to trim the federal bureaucracy, as most Americans say they want. In
congressional town halls and interviews, even Trump voters have said they are
tired of Mr. Musk’s bloodletting. In a poll released this month, 58 percent of those
surveyed said they disapproved of how Mr. Musk was handling DOGE’s work, and
60 percent disapproved of Mr. Musk himself.
Are you a federal worker? We want to hear from you.
The Times would like to hear about your experience as a federal worker under the second
Trump administration. We may reach out about your submission, but we will not publish
any part of your response without contacting you first.
‘We Will Make Mistakes’
A week after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the Office of Personnel Management sent a
now infamous email to more than two million federal workers with the subject line
“Fork in the Road.” They were told they could either resign and be paid through
September or risk being sacked down the road.
The email ignited anger and confusion over whether DOGE had the legal authority
to pay workers through September. Federal employee unions sued, but a judge
allowed the program to go forward. About 75,000 people left, or about three
percent. If the administration does not renege on its offer, it will be paying their
salaries into the fall.

The mass buyout did not favor highly rated performers nor distinguish crucial jobs
from nonessential ones, practices that guided furloughs during past government
shutdowns. Consequently, the administration wound up trying to reverse an
exodus of people in vital roles.
“We will make mistakes,” Mr. Musk told cabinet members in February. After he
boasted of feeding the United States Agency for International Development “into
the wood chipper,” a move a judge later found violated the Constitution, Mr. Musk
discovered that “one of the things we accidentally canceled very briefly was Ebola
prevention.” But his claim to have swiftly repaired the damage was inaccurate.
Separately, a New York Times investigation into cuts to the National Nuclear
Security Administration illustrates the effect of the buyouts on efforts to safeguard
and modernize the nation’s nuclear weapons. Of more than 130 people who were
fired or accepted DOGE’s invitation to quit, at least 27 were engineers, 13 were
program or project analysts, 12 were program or project managers, and five were
physicists or scientists.
Four of these employees were specialists handling the secure transport of nuclear
materials, and a half dozen worked in the agency unit that builds reactors for
nuclear submarines.
“Those are such hard jobs to fill, because people could make as much or more
money working for the plant or laboratory itself,” said Jill Hruby, who led the
National Nuclear Security Administration during the Biden administration.
Several people on the nuclear safety team found new jobs with the government
contractors they once supervised. Across government, a disproportionate number
of professionals in high demand by the private sector have quit, according to Mr.
Stier.
“There are plenty of people who are best in class who are sticking it out because
they’re so purpose-driven,” he said. “But it’s easier for someone who has options to
say, ‘This is crazy, I’m not going to do this anymore,’ and go someplace else.”
‘Money Being Deliberately Wasted’
In mid-February, the Office of Personnel Management targeted all 220,000 of the
federal government’s probationary employees, who are new or newly promoted
professionals serving a one- to two-year trial period with fewer worker protections.
They included a cadre of younger, tech-savvy professionals hired at great expense
to replace a wave of baby boomer retirees. Hiring and training them cost about
$10,000 for a clerical worker to more than $1 million for an elite spy.
“This is the equivalent of a major-league baseball franchise firing all of their minor-
league players,” said Kevin Carroll, a former C.I.A. officer and lawyer who
represents some of the fired workers. “It’s a huge amount of money being
deliberately wasted.”
About 24,000 probationary employees across nearly 20 agencies had been fired by
March 13, when a federal judge in Maryland ruled that the cuts were illegal and
ordered the agencies to rehire the workers, but the government appealed and the
legal wrangling continues. By law, probationary employees can only be fired for
cause, typically for poor performance, Judge James K. Bredar of the Federal
District Court in Maryland said in a lengthy ruling.
The Treasury Department in Washington last month. A federal judge in Maryland
ruled that the firing of probationary workers was illegal and ordered agencies to rehire

He ordered the government to recall the fired workers, including 7,600 from the
Treasury Department, 5,700 at the Agriculture Department and more than 3,200 at
the Department of Health and Human Services, according to court filings. But the
administration instead put them on paid leave, where they collect annual salaries
averaging $106,000 while waiting in limbo.
For each probationary worker DOGE idled, the government lost thousands of
dollars it spent on recruitment, hiring incentives, security clearances and training,
an investment normally recouped over years of service. In one case, a fired
probationary employee with the Department of Health and Human Services
received a pay raise after she was reinstated and put on paid leave.
The administration cut about 400 probationary workers at the Federal Aviation
Administration after multiple plane crashes, including one in Washington in
January that killed 67 people. The layoffs included maintenance mechanics and
aviation safety assistants.
The C.I.A. confirmed last month that some officers hired in the past two years had
been summoned to a location away from the agency’s headquarters in Langley, Va.,
and asked to surrender their credentials to security personnel. About 80 officers
were let go.
Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence
Committee, said it cost $400,000 to get a C.I.A. recruit through the security
clearance process and specialized training.
Inflicting Pain
The theatrics around the firings, including an appearance by Mr. Musk at a
conservative political convention waving a chain saw, suggest they are also about
inflicting pain on a bureaucracy Mr. Trump perceives as a subversive “deep state.”
That was a goal for federal employees set by Russell T. Vought, who now leads the
Office of Management and Budget. “When they wake up in the morning, we want
them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the
villains,” Mr. Vought told a conservative gathering in 2023.

Harbor, Md., in February. Eric Lee/The New York Times
Ms. Buchholz and Mr. Stier emphasize that the government is indeed inefficient
and needs reform. But by “gleefully torturing people,” Ms. Buchholz said, DOGE
has hurt the government’s ability to recruit young, talented workers to lead a
modernization.
“This country historically has had an independent public service that attracts
people focused on service to Americans,” Ms. Buchholz said. “But this
administration values the kind of service you get from political appointees, who
serve at the president’s pleasure.”

Devorah Lev-Tov,NYT,1,Business,4/26/2025,"How Sarah Paiji Yoo, the Co-Founder of Blueland, Spends Her Sundays","Sarah Paiji Yoo started her career in finance and then founded several start-ups,
mostly in the fashion and beauty worlds. But during parental leave after the birth
of her first child, she realized how many microplastics her family was inadvertently
consuming.
“I started to have mixed feelings around pushing people to buy more things, when
I didn’t feel like they needed it,” Ms. Yoo, 40, said. “On the other side of becoming a
mother, I realized I still loved working, and I still loved early-stage company
building, but I just needed more meaning in the work that I was doing.”
So in 2019 she co-founded Blueland, reimagining household cleaning products to
eliminate single-use plastic packaging. She appeared on “Shark Tank” (and scored
a deal) that same year.
Her company sells tablets that can be mixed with water in reusable bottles to make
things like hand soap and cleaning sprays, or dropped directly into a dishwasher,
washing machine or toilet. The tablets come in compostable paper packaging.
Ms. Yoo is originally from Cerritos, Calif., and moved to New York City 19 years
ago. She met her husband, Kenneth Yoo, at a bar; nine months after their first date,
the two were engaged. They had their son Noah in 2017. Colin followed in 2020. The

foursome moved into a five-bedroom co-op on the Upper West Side the next year.
MORNING SNUGGLES I don’t need an alarm clock on the weekends — I can
definitely rely on my kids to wake me up. These days it’s around 6:30, maybe 6:40
if we’re lucky. They run into our room and we usually bring them into bed, not only
because it’s a nice moment, but Ken and I are trying to squeeze in an extra few
minutes in bed.
RUNNING SOLO A new thing that started this year is I go for a quick solo run. I
turned 40 last year, and I think it’s just hitting me that exercise is important: being
strong, not falling when I get older, and just being able to be around as long as I
can. We live right by Riverside Park and it’s always a good reminder that, wow,
Manhattan is an island! I feel so grateful to live less than a five-minute walk from
the water.

COFFEE AND CROISSANTS I’ll run for 20 minutes and then I’ll swing back to pick
up my reusable mugs to bring with me to the coffee shop. There’s a new French
bakery that opened up nearby called La Farine Patisserie et Café. I love that it
replaced a gigantic Starbucks.
For the kids, it’s a chocolate croissant and a plain croissant, one for each. I will do a
baguette with butter and jam. One of the best parts of the weekend is I allow myself
to buy coffee. It just tastes better when somebody else makes it.

PLAY BALL We are a baseball family through and through. My husband played
Division I; he was a pitcher in college. So, many Sundays for our family in the
spring are occupied by a good amount of baseball. Noah plays Little League, and
Colin plays T-ball. Noah’s games are usually in Central Park or Randall’s Island on
Sundays.
Ms. Yoo stopped by a farmer’s market by the American Museum of Natural History on the Upper West

ECO-FRIENDLY ERRANDS On Sundays, we have this loop that we do. First,
there’s the farmer’s market by the American Museum of Natural History. There are
a few stands that we always hit up for our fresh produce and flowers; Wood Thrush
Farm is my absolute fave. We used to bring our compost to the market, but now
that the city rolled out the smart compost bins, we stop at one on the way. And if we
have any textiles that we wouldn’t donate, we hit up the textile drop-off at the
farmer’s market.
Ken and I both wear contact lenses and they aren’t recyclable by the city. What can
be recycled with the city is anything that’s hard and firm, but anything that’s soft
has to go through a different recycling stream that’s not available curbside. There’s
an optometrist near our house where we can drop off any used contact lenses. And
then we also drop off plastic film, bags and bubble wrap at the Fairway in our
neighborhood.
There’s still a lot of plastic that, unfortunately, is not recyclable, even with flexible
plastic recycling. For example, the kids want animal-shaped Cheddar crackers that
come in a chip bag with that inside plastic lining. I think these are things that, in
my heart of hearts, I would love for Blueland to also tackle — but probably not in
the next, realistically, 10 years.

GARDENING If the kids don’t have a birthday party or play date, we might stop by
the West Side Community Garden. I’m a member, even though we don’t have our
own plot yet. It’s a requirement as a member to volunteer four hours a month. I’m
on the flower committee and composting committee.
I SCREAM, YOU SCREAM Ken and I are firm believers: Weekends are for eating
ice cream. Noah loves gelato; he loves Amorino. I love Salt & Straw, and that they
encourage sampling. It’s also nice because they do the metal spoons for the
sampling. I would not feel comfortable if they were like, “Oh, here’s another single-
use, disposable spoon.” Colin and Ken love Gelateria Gentile. If we have time, the
kids will scooter and we’ll just hit up all three.

SOAP TEST When we can, Ken and I try to do a date night on Sundays. Typically,
his parents come in from Queens. When we get home, I’ll do some cleaning — as
much as they’re family, it’s still my mother-in-law! During that period, if there’s
anything I’m testing, I bring in my sons to help. It’s kind of fun, because my older
son is old enough to be interested. We might be dissolving new hand soap scents or
trying out new laundry tablets.
DATE NIGHT We love doing date night at, like, 5 p.m. The world is your oyster at 5
p.m. because you can get a lot of reservations. Our ideal date night is omakase and
a foot massage. We’ll typically go to a local walk-in massage place — one of the
ones where you just kind of sit in a chair in the open — and get a foot massage. And
then we’ll be home for bedtime.
EARLY TO BED I like to go to bed on Sundays very early, with the kids. I’m
admittedly really bad about getting enough sleep during the week. I’m trying to
embrace that we’re still in the moment of time where the kids still want to snuggle
in bed and still want me in their beds. It just feels so warm and it helps put me to
sleep in a way that I think I struggle with during the week.

Tony Romm,NYT,1,Business,4/27/2025,Trump’s Tariffs Prompt Wave of Lawsuits,"Somewhere along a roughly 7,500-mile journey that begins in Shenzhen, China,
there are 19 shipments bound for Rick Woldenberg, the chief executive of Learning
Resources, an educational toy company in Vernon Hills, Ill.
Eventually, the containers of puzzle cards, child binoculars and other products will
reach a port in the United States, and Mr. Woldenberg will face a difficult and
expensive decision. He can pay the sky-high tariffs that President Trump has
imposed on most foreign goods, or forgo at least some of the much-needed
inventory, perhaps imperiling his bottom line.
Mr. Woldenberg expects to do a bit of both. But he has also opted for a more
aggressive course of action, joining a growing roster of opponents now legally
challenging Mr. Trump’s ability to issue some of the tariffs in the first place.
Trump’s Tariffs Prompt Wave of Lawsuits as
States and Businesses Fight Back

inbox.
Nearly four weeks into a costly global trade war with no end in sight, Mr. Trump is
facing a barrage of lawsuits from state officials, small businesses and even once-
allied political groups, all contending that the president cannot sidestep Congress
and tax virtually any import at levels to his liking.
The lawsuits carry great significance, not just because the tariffs have roiled
financial markets and threatened to plunge the United States into a recession. The
legal challenges also stand to test Mr. Trump’s claims of expansive presidential
power, while illustrating the difficult calculation that his opponents face in deciding
whether to fight back and risk retribution.
None of the lawsuits filed this month are supported by major business lobbying
groups, even though many organizations — including the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce and the Business Roundtable — have been sharply critical of the
president’s tariffs and lobbied to lessen their impact. The chamber privately
debated bringing a lawsuit, but ultimately decided it was “not the best course of
action at this time,” said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president of the group.
“Engaging the administration in order to achieve a quick and immediate reduction
in tariffs has the best chance of aiding businesses,” he said.

Instead, the battle has been left to a scattered yet growing roster of litigants,
including Mr. Woldenberg, whose lawyers sued on Tuesday. In an interview, he said
the tariffs had become so costly that he had “nothing to lose” by taking legal action.
“I’m going to do everything in my power to keep our company healthy, but we’re
hobbled,” he said.
Last week, a dozen Democratic attorneys general from states including Colorado,
New York and Oregon also asked a federal judge to block many of Mr. Trump’s
tariffs on grounds that they had “upended the constitutional order and brought
chaos to the American economy.” California sued earlier this month, claiming the
president’s policies harmed its economy and budget.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The Business
Roundtable also did not respond to a request for comment.
At the heart of the legal wrangling is a 1970s law, the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act, which enables the president to order trade embargoes, set
sanctions and limit foreign investment to ward off adversaries abroad.
Mr. Trump invoked that law to impose his initial duties on Chinese exports, in what
he described as an effort to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States. He also
used those powers to establish a 10 percent tax on exports from nearly every other
country and to justify what he calls “reciprocal” tariffs, which will charge even
steeper duties on countries including U.S. allies. For evidence of an emergency, Mr.
Trump primarily pointed to the trade deficit — the difference between what the
United States exports to other nations and what it imports.
No president before Mr. Trump had ever imposed such import taxes under the
emergency law, which does not once mention the word “tariff.” That omission has
set the stage for a series of pivotal legal clashes, hinging in part on whether the law
truly empowers the president “without actually, explicitly saying tariffs,” said Ted
Murphy, a co-leader of the global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice at the
law firm Sidley Austin.
The latest lawsuit arrived Thursday from the Pacific Legal Foundation, a group
with reported ties to the conservative donor Charles Koch. On behalf of a clothing
company, a board game designer and other small businesses, the group faulted Mr.
Trump for imposing an “unlawful and unconstitutional” 145 percent tariff on
Chinese goods, resulting in higher prices for American businesses.
Jamey Stegmaier, a co-founder of Stonemaier Games and a plaintiff in the case,
said his company had more than 250,000 board games and other products on order
that it could not easily import from China, unless it was willing to pay a “total tariff
tax of around $1.5 million.”
The decision to sue was the “right thing” but still a difficult choice, Mr. Stegmaier
said, citing a fear of retribution from Mr. Trump. “It’s kind of a scary proposition to
oppose the administration right now,” he said.
Another legal group with ties to Mr. Koch and the conservative financier Leonard
A. Leo sued early this month on behalf of a Florida company facing high costs from
the president’s tariffs on China. Mr. Leo is a co-chairman of the Federalist Society,
which has advised Mr. Trump on judicial appointments.
The organization behind the lawsuit, the New Civil Liberties Alliance, does not
disclose its full range of donors, nor do any of its like-minded peers, making it
difficult to determine the exact driving financial force behind each of the new tariff
cases.

does not have,” said Rob Bonta, the attorney general of California. The New York Times
In a separate lawsuit, two members of one of the largest tribes in the United States
claimed that Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Canada violated treaty rights, and they asked a
judge to halt taxes on imports arriving at key points of entry.
Rob Bonta, the Democratic attorney general of California, said his state’s tariff
lawsuit was similar to its other legal battles with Mr. Trump and came down to the
“core issue of executive authority.”
“Our position has been clear, time and time again, that we will not allow this
president to exert authority he does not have,” Mr. Bonta said.
Mr. Trump has said he is moving forward with tariffs in order to raise billions of
dollars in revenue, encourage more domestic manufacturing and force America’s
trading partners to make concessions, including dropping tariffs on U.S. goods.
Without the economic emergency law, the president could have been forced to use
much slower and narrower paths to tariffs, as he did with sector-specific levies
including those on the auto industry.
Greta Peisch, a former trade official who is a partner at the law firm Wiley Rein,
said those tariffs were a more “established practice,” arising from federal
investigations into those industries, so challenging them would be an “uphill
battle.”
In enacting the economic emergency law in 1977, Congress sought to curtail
presidential powers after past commanders in chief had overused emergency
declarations. President Richard M. Nixon had even tapped a precursor trade
statute to impose his own 10 percent duty on imports, which similarly drew a court
challenge, though the president prevailed.
Decades later, lawyers for Mr. Trump have cited that legislative history to argue
that they can impose tariffs in response to economic emergencies — primarily
because Congress never explicitly said they could not. That position has put the
administration at odds with constitutional scholars who take the view that the
executive branch cannot claim powers that are not expressly granted to it.
“The president doesn’t have authority outside of authorities delegated to him by
Congress to issue tariffs,” said Jeffrey Schwab, a senior counsel at the Liberty
Justice Center, a nonprofit with past ties to Richard Uihlein, an Illinois industrialist
and a Republican megadonor.
This month, the group sued the Trump administration on behalf of small
businesses that say the recent tariffs have harmed them. That included Victor
Schwartz, the founder of VOS Selections, a New York City company that imports
specialty wine, spirits and sake.
For the moment, Mr. Schwartz said, his company has been mostly unscathed,
securing its latest shipments before the highest tariffs take effect. Soon, though, he
may have to delay orders, cancel them or make other cuts, he predicted.
Faulting “billionaires sitting around doing nothing,” Mr. Schwartz added of his
choice to join the legal battle: “I just felt like, ‘Put up or shut up.’”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/us/politics/trump-tariffs-lawsuits.html
Ginia Bellafante,NYT,1,Business,4/26/2025,Harvard’s War With Trump Forces Question of How Endowments Should Be Spent,"Among Harvard University’s many distinctions remains the fact it is the oldest
continuing corporation in the Western Hemisphere. The designation originates in a
charter, authorizing a board of officers to oversee the college’s finances, property
and receipt of gifts. Nearing his death in 1638, John Harvard, a Puritan minister,
left half his estate to the institution that would soon bear his name. Five years later
came a contribution of 100 pounds from Ann Radcliffe to underwrite Harvard’s first
scholarships. The university’s funds, as the historian Bruce Kimball has noted, are
the oldest perpetual investments in the United States.
At $53.2 billion, Harvard’s endowment is the largest in the world, with more than 70
percent of its portfolio given over to interests in hedge funds and private equity.
The endowment does not include its real estate, which encompasses acres of land
across the river in Boston, parcels of which the university purchased for $88
million over several years in the 1990s, anonymously to avoid the possibility of
paying more. In 2023, the university’s chief investment officer, a title absent from
any 17th-century charter, made $7.6 million. These figures can breed confusion, if
not hostility, among the many people whose lives will never be touched by
Massachusetts Hall.
Harvard’s Endowment Is $53.2 Billion. What
Should It Be For?
The Trump administration’s war against higher education for what it insists is a
dangerous culture of intellectual inflexibility has forced a debate about capital as
central now as the vast underlying disagreements over values. The endowment of
the University of Pennsylvania, to take one example, stands at three and a half
times the municipal budget of Philadelphia. If universities can claim assets like
this, it can be hard to understand what keeps them from releasing funds to cover
the research dollars the government is taking away in the name of eradicating
“wokeness.”
Unlike Columbia, which bowed to the White House, Harvard resisted. In retaliation,
the government froze $2.2 billion in grant funding and threatened to revoke its tax-
exempt status. Harvard has since sued the government, arguing that it cannot
interfere with the university’s right to free speech, “to advance its own vision of
ideological balance.”
Harvard might choose to go deeper into its reserves to compensate for losses. Or it
might elect to take on more debt, or roll out a fund-raising campaign in the name of
defending academic freedom — The Harvard Crimson reported that more than $1
million in online donations came in within 24 hours of the university’s announcing
it would not concede. This month, both former President Barack Obama and
Lawrence Summers, who had presided over Harvard and the U.S. Treasury, made
the point that the endowments of rich universities were there to be activated in a
crisis and did not exist, as Mr. Summers put it in a guest essay in The New York
Times, “to simply be envied or admired.”
For the millions of Americans who do not pay attention to Ivy League investment
strategy, that might not seem like an especially defiant proposition. But the idea
abrades fiercely held tradition. It is a commandment of managing any trust, but
especially university endowments, that the principal go untouched. If you suggest
to academic bureaucrats that there must be a way for huge endowments to cover
prospective cuts in government funding — and you are not Larry Summers — they
will look at you as if you were a child wondering why it is unwise to leave raw eggs
out in the sun.
Recently, university administrators have unleashed a PowerPoint of clichés to
explain what endowments, with their significant spending limitations, are not. An
endowment is not a “piggy bank” or a “checking account” or a “rainy day fund” (to
which some reasonably wonder, “Why not?”).
What endowments are becomes considerably more complicated — a matter of
existential priority as much as it is a question of practical application, one leading
inevitability to a reckoning with the ideals that wealthy universities are ultimately
meant to serve.
The Circuitous Logic of Infinite Growth
Harvard has sued the government, arguing that it cannot interfere with the university’s right to free

Concerted efforts to raise funds among alumni began at Williams College in 1821.
But it was Charles Eliot, Harvard’s president 50 years later, who brought a focus to
long-term financial planning, shaken as he was by the loss of his family’s fortune in
the Panic of 1857. Mr. Eliot is featured in “Wealth Cost and Price in American
Higher Education,” Mr. Kimball’s excellent book on the history of college financing.
In it, he charts two momentous periods in the history of endowments. The first
came at the turn of the last century with the surge of wealth produced by the
Industrial Revolution, which gave way to so much philanthropy and the founding of
universities like Stanford, Vanderbilt and Carnegie Mellon.
The next era took shape in the late 1980s and ’90s with what became known as the
Yale Model, pioneered by David Swensen, who in 1985 left a career at Lehman
Brothers to run Yale’s endowment. Mr. Swensen’s innovation was to redirect
investments away from conventional formulas for allocations mostly held in stocks
and bonds and toward private equity, hedge and venture capital funds, as well as
real estate. Over his 35-year tenure he averaged returns of 13.1 percent. Like
Warren Buffett, Mr. Swensen became a guru in the field, with acolytes spread out
across the academic ecosystem swelling wealth in elite higher education.
As a doctoral student in economics, Mr. Swensen had been mentored by James
Tobin, a Nobel laureate whose work provides the dominant thinking around
endowments. In an influential paper published in 1974, Mr. Tobin introduced the
idea of “intergenerational equity,” a phrase woven through annual reports. “The
trustees of an endowed institution,” Mr. Tobin wrote “are the guardians of the
future against the claims of the present.” This emerged as a mantra embedded in
the assumption that universities are “immortal.”
Running the Ford Foundation in the late 1960s, McGeorge Bundy, a former
presidential adviser, had already been worrying about the costs of higher
education. He commissioned studies that produced two enduring
recommendations — the first that endowment managers invest more aggressively,
in growth stocks, to build wealth rather than merely avert losses and the second
that they spend their annual earnings prudently, according to a rule.
For decades universities have taken it as catechism to spend their year-to-year
earnings at a rate of no more than 5 percent of the total endowment (often less).
Foundations as well as cultural and religious institutions are required by law to
spend a 5 percent minimum; colleges and universities are not but do so because
they think it is sound policy. (A few states, including Massachusetts, do have laws
requiring “prudence” from universities.)
Morton Schapiro, a former president of Williams and later Northwestern,
described the origins of the standard as “completely arbitrary” and yet fortuitous.
“If you look back at the past 10 to 20 years, endowments have earned about 8
percent a year; inflation has been about 3 percent. Guess what? Five percent, it’s
turned out to be a remarkably good rule of thumb.”
At the most basic level, that annual draw helps pay for the business of keeping a
university going. Every year, the National Association of College and University
Business Officers issues a report on the strength of endowments and where the
money they generate ends up. The most recent looked at 658 institutions. About 48
percent of investment income went to student aid. Tuition, as high as it is, does not
cover the cost of an education at most places; about a quarter of the money, the
research showed, went to academic programs and maintaining facilities.
The fixation with infinite growth can hijack endowments to a circuitous logic,
making them problematic in ways that are surfacing now. Locked up in order to get
bigger, they become harder to access when they are needed, and the bigger they
get, the more vulnerable they become to popular resentments.
As the most prestigious universities have followed the exalted fortunes of Wall
Street, they have subjected themselves to the animosities leveled against the
financial class; they can seem like the rich friend showing up for lunch with a
Vacheron Constantin on her wrist, complaining about the cost of renovating her
place in Jackson Hole while insisting on splitting the check.
A Mark of Status
Some observers of the campus upheaval have noted that Columbia, rather than acquiesce to the
government’s demands to preserve $400 million in grant money, might have borrowed against its

From one vantage, huge endowments are an invention of Wall Street, justified as
virtue. Universities defend them as an essential means of securing the most
talented faculty, supporting the most valuable research, delivering the most aid.
But universities imagine themselves as quasi democracies in a way that Goldman
Sachs does not. When every constituency is given a voice, many opinions are
rendered. As Derek Bok, another former Harvard president, once pointed out, a
huge endowment is a disadvantage to the extent that it elevates expectations that
surplus ought to be targeted toward righting perceived injustices.
Endowments are not meant to be tools of politics, but they inevitably appear that
way when donors writing $50 million checks assert priorities that may not be
politically neutral. The competition for contributions can force concessions to
philanthropic interest, vanity and control. Much of what cannot be easily freed in
any single fund falls under the category of “restricted use,” which typically means
that it has been earmarked according to donor prerogative. Very few people turn
over six or seven figures to their alma mater and say, “Enjoy!”
Even in quiet times, outsize endowments invite skepticism given the inequities
they expose in education more broadly. In recent years, a number of small liberal
arts colleges have closed because they could not afford the alternative. For every
undergraduate enrolled in Columbia or Cornell, 92 more are going to ailing, public
two-year colleges.
Whether it should be the concern of the richest schools to help the poorest, the
belief that elite universities have stockpiled too much money is shared across
political affiliations. Two years ago, Zohran Mamdani, a progressive New York
State assemblyman now running for mayor, introduced failed legislation to end
more than $321 million in annual property tax exemption for New York University
and Columbia and divert that money to the city’s troubled public university system.
There are proposals from Republicans in Congress to increase the tax on large
endowments, potentially to 14 percent, much higher than the 1.4 percent put in
place eight years ago. Assuming a 10 percent return, that would leave Harvard with
a tax bill of about $742,000,000, roughly equal to what it spent on financial aid last
year. But you can go around and round. If Harvard raised its endowment draw,
however sacrilegiously, to 7 percent, it would add about $1.3 billion to its budget.
Undoubtedly the prospect of higher taxes and the realities of a chaotic stock
market have made the notion of tapping endowment income more robustly seem
even less attractive to trustees. But those who consider endowments essentially
inviolate dismiss some of the workarounds. It is true that as endowments have
become more heavily invested in hedge funds and private equity, they have
become less liquid. But there are secondary markets for selling positions in some of
these funds if a need for cash is urgent. There are reports that Harvard is now
considering this option.
One of the great luxuries of having a lot of money is the ability to borrow against it,
often cheaply. Princeton University’s president, Christopher Eisgruber, has become
one of the most prominent critics of the Trump administration’s antagonisms
toward the academy. In response to the federal government’s freezing of several
dozen grants, the university, rather than hike up its draw, has issued bonds as a
means of raising cash.
Some observers of the recent campus upheaval have noted that Columbia, the
largest landowner in New York City, rather than acquiesce to the government’s
demands to preserve $400 million in grant money, might have borrowed against its
real estate, the value of which stands apart from its $14 billion endowment.
Harvard, with its triple-A rating, has issued more than $1 billion in bonds since
March. “For a bondholder, the only question is: ‘Will I be paid?’” said Larry Ladd, a
former budget director at the university who is now a consultant. “If Harvard were
liquidated, they would get paid,” he added.
And while many restrictions are imposed by donors, others are imposed by the
university itself, Mr. Schapiro of Williams and Northwestern explained to me
recently, “so they can be unrestricted.” Although it is difficult to pull off, and Mr.
Schapiro does not recommend it as protocol, he once approached the grandson of a
donor who had died long ago to ask if he could use the money for something other
than what was intended. The grandson said yes.
Years after Mr. Tobin delivered his immortality thesis, Henry B. Hansmann, an
economist and a professor at Yale Law School, published a retort, questioning what
was equitable about privileging a world long into the future over the exigencies of
the moment. Whatever lasting arguments his theory might have ignited seem to
have given way to an understanding of an endowment as an end in itself, a stand-in
for a university’s purpose, a rejection of the idea that underlying a belief in
institutional eternity is an alienating self-regard.
As Mr. Swensen, the pioneer of the Yale Model, once put it: “Short of beating an
archrival in football,” posting an endowment’s highest year-end result “ranks near
the top” of “institutional aspiration,” a mark of status with which it becomes
possible to raise more and more money. Modern universities are essentially
engaged in a contest of inverse ratio: Which can claim the most dramatic
differential between the amount of money piled up and the percentage of
applicants turned away.
The Trump administration has named 60 universities it plans to investigate; soon
enough, many will most likely have to wrestle with the questions Harvard and
Columbia have. If they believe they deserve to last forever, they might ask what
besides money they want to leave behind.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/26/business/harvard-endowment-trump.html
Karen Weise;Kenneth Chang,NYT,1,Business,4/28/2025,Amazon Launches First 27 Project Kuiper Internet Satellites,"The battle of billionaires in space between Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk has entered a
new arena: satellite internet.
Amazon, the company that Mr. Bezos started as an online bookseller three decades
ago, is now a merchandising behemoth, the owner of the James Bond franchise, a
seller of electronic gadgets like Echo smart speakers and one of the most powerful
providers of cloud computing.
So perhaps it is not a surprise that Amazon has now launched the first few of
thousands of satellites known as Project Kuiper to provide another option for
remaining connected in the modern world. The market for beaming high-speed
internet to the ground from orbit is currently dominated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX
rocket company, which operates a similar service, Starlink. Starlink, with
thousands of satellites in orbit and more launching nearly every week, already
serves several million customers around the world.
The company’s first 27 satellites were shipped to space and deployed into orbit on
Monday evening.
On Tuesday morning, Amazon said it had established communications with all of
the satellites, and the sequence of turning them on was “proceeding as planned.”
”While this is the first step in a much longer journey to launch the rest of our low
Earth orbit constellation,” Andy Jassy, the chief executive of Amazon, wrote in a
posting on X, “it represents an incredible amount of invention and hard work.”
When was the launch?
The satellite lifted off on Monday at 7:01 p.m. Eastern time from Cape Canaveral
Space Force Station in Florida. They were carried by an Atlas V, a rocket made by
United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.
The spacecraft deployed the Kuiper satellites in a circular orbit at 280 miles above
the surface. The satellites’ propulsion system will then gradually raise that orbit to
an altitude of 393 miles.
“This launch marks the first step towards the future of our partnership and
increased launch cadence,” Tory Bruno, United Launch Alliance’s chief executive,
said in a statement.
What is Project Kuiper?
Project Kuiper will be a constellation of internet satellites intended to provide high-
speed data connections to almost every point on Earth. Doing this successfully will
require thousands of satellites, and Amazon’s goal is to operate more than 3,200 in
the years to come.
The company will compete with SpaceX’s Starlink, a service that was originally
marketed primarily to residential customers.
While Kuiper also aims for that market, particularly in remote areas, it will also be
integrated with Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing offering,
which is popular with large corporations and governments around the world. That
might make it more attractive to businesses that involve satellite imagery or
weather forecasting that not only need to move large amounts of data across the
internet, but also to perform calculations on the data.
Ground stations will connect the Kuiper satellites to the web services
infrastructure in a manner that could also allow companies to communicate with
their own remote equipment. For example, Amazon has suggested that energy
companies could use Kuiper to monitor and control remote wind farms or offshore
drilling platforms.
In October 2023, two prototype Kuiper satellites were launched to test the
technology. Amazon said that the tests were successful. Those prototypes were
never meant to serve in the operational constellation, and after seven months they
were nudged back into the atmosphere, where they burned up. The company said it
has since updated the designs of “every system and subsystem on board.”
“There’s a big difference between launching two satellites and launching 3,000
satellites,” said Rajeev Badyal, an Amazon executive in charge of Kuiper, in a
promotional video ahead of the launch.

satellite processing facility at Cape Canaveral last month. Amazon, via Agence France-Presse

When will Amazon provide internet service from space?
Amazon told the Federal Communications Commission in 2020 that service would
begin after it had deployed its first 578 satellites. The company has said that it
expects to connect customers to the internet later this year.
While a fully functional constellation needs thousands of satellites, the company
can offer service in specific regions with far fewer in orbit before expanding to
more global coverage later on.
The F.C.C.’s approval of the constellation came with a requirement that at least half
the satellites needed to be deployed by July 30, 2026. Industry analysts say the
company could get an extension if it has demonstrated substantial progress by
then.
Getting the satellites into orbit also depends on rocket launches occurring on
schedule, which can be a problem if enough rockets are not available. Amazon also
needs to build hundreds of ground stations, to relay their signals to users.
Is space too crowded for both SpaceX and Amazon?
In 2000, there were fewer than 1,000 satellites in Earth orbit.
Today, SpaceX alone operates more than 7,000 Starlink satellites, and it hopes to
increase that total to 42,000.
Other megaconstellations, including Project Kuiper, could multiply the number of
satellites in the region called low-Earth orbit by several times, and will require
careful orbital traffic control to avoid colliding with each other or with other debris
in low Earth orbit.
But satellites like Kuiper and Starlink do not stay in low Earth orbit indefinitely. At
the end of their service life, they are intentionally removed from orbit to burn up in
the atmosphere. Even if they fail completely, air resistance alone will pull them to
their destruction within a few years so they will not add to the long-term clutter of
space.
What other rockets will launch Kuiper to orbit?
In April 2022, Amazon announced that it was purchasing up to 83 launches
carrying Kuiper satellites, on a series of rockets. Some would fly on New Glenn, a
powerful, voluminous rocket made by Jeff Bezos’ spaceflight company, Blue Origin.
Others would lift off on a Vulcan, a new rocket from United Launch Alliance. Other
batches will travel on the Ariane 6 from Arianespace, a European rocket company.
These three vehicles are new, and have only been launched a handful of times.
In December 2023, Amazon also purchased three Falcon 9 launches for 2025 from
SpaceX, its direct competitor for Kuiper. That decision was made months after a
pension fund sued Amazon, saying that the company’s board of trustees had acted
in bad faith in arranging almost all of the Kuiper launches on the unproven rockets
while ignoring the Falcon 9, which is the dominant rocket in modern spaceflight
and likely to be the less expensive one.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/science/amazon-kuiper-launch-

Michael M. Grynbaum;Benjamin Mullin,NYT,1,Business,4/27/2025,‘60 Minutes’ Rebukes Paramount On-Air Over Executive Producer’s Exit,"In an extraordinary on-air rebuke, one of the top journalists at “60 Minutes”
directly criticized the program’s parent company in the final moments of its
Sunday night CBS telecast, its first episode since the program’s executive producer,
Bill Owens, announced his intention to resign.
“Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways,” the correspondent, Scott
Pelley, told viewers. “None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the
independence that honest journalism requires.”
A spokesman for Paramount had no immediate comment, and has previously
declined to comment on Mr. Owens’s departure.
Mr. Owens stunned the show’s staff on Tuesday when he said he would leave the
highest-rated program in television news over disagreements with Paramount,
CBS’s corporate parent, saying, “It’s clear the company is done with me.”
‘60 Minutes’ Chastises Its Corporate Parent in
Unusual On-Air Rebuke
Mr. Owens’s comments were widely reported in the press last week. The show’s
decision to repeat those grievances on-air may have exposed viewers to the
serious tensions between “60 Minutes” and its corporate overseers for the first
time.
Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of Paramount, has been intent on
securing approval from the Trump administration for a multibillion-dollar sale of
her media company to a studio run by the son of Larry Ellison, the tech billionaire.
President Trump sued CBS last year, claiming $10 billion in damages, in a case
stemming from a “60 Minutes” interview with the 2024 Democratic presidential
nominee, Kamala Harris, that Mr. Trump said was deceptively edited. Ms.
Redstone has expressed her desire to settle Mr. Trump’s lawsuit, although legal
experts have called the case far-fetched.
In his remarks on Sunday night’s telecast, Mr. Pelley presented Mr. Owens’s
decision to resign as an effort to protect “60 Minutes” from further interference.
“He did it for us and you,” Mr. Pelley told viewers of the show, which began airing
in 1968. “Stories we pursued for 57 years are often controversial — lately, the
Israel-Gaza War and the Trump administration. Bill made sure they were accurate
and fair. He was tough that way. But our parent company, Paramount, is trying to
complete a merger. The Trump administration must approve it.”
After “60 Minutes” ran a segment in January about the war between Israel and
Hamas, Ms. Redstone complained to CBS executives about what she considered
the segment’s unfair slant. A day later, CBS appointed a veteran producer to a new
role involving journalistic standards. She reviewed certain “60 Minutes” segments
that were deemed sensitive.
Representatives for Mr. Trump and for Paramount are involved in settlement talks,
and mediation is expected to start this week.
Mr. Pelley’s on-air monologue on Sunday night evoked a previous moment of public
discord between “60 Minutes” and its corporate overseers.
In 1995, also in a closing note to viewers, the correspondent Mike Wallace said on
air that the program had chosen not to broadcast an interview with a former
tobacco industry executive because managers at CBS News had given in to legal
pressure. “60 Minutes” ultimately aired the interview, and the episode was later
dramatized in “The Insider,” a 1999 movie starring Al Pacino as Lowell Bergman, a
“60 Minutes” producer.
Sunday’s “60 Minutes” episode also featured a segment that examined the Trump
administration’s decision to reduce funding to the National Institutes of Health,
including an interview with a former director who expressed his concerns about
adverse effects on Americans’ health.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/business/media/60-minutes-scott-pelley-paramount.html
Jeanna Smialek;Liz Alderman;Melissa Eddy,NYT,1,Business,4/27/2025,Europe’s Pharma Industry Braces for Pain as Trump Tariff Threat Looms,"Insulin, heart treatments and antibiotics have flowed freely across many borders
for decades, exempt from tariffs in a bid to make medicine affordable. But that
could soon change.
For months, President Trump has been promising to impose higher tariffs on
pharmaceuticals as part of his plan to reorder the global trading system and bring
key manufacturing industries back to the United States. This month, he said
pharmaceutical tariffs could come in the “not too distant future.”
If they do, the move would have serious — and wildly uncertain — consequences
for drugs made in the European Union.

Pharmaceutical products and chemicals are the bloc’s No. 1 export to America.
Among them are the weight-loss blockbuster Ozempic, cancer treatments,
cardiovascular drugs and flu vaccines. Most are name-brand drugs that yield a
large profit in the American market, with its high prices and vast numbers of
consumers.
“These are critical things that keep people alive,” said Léa Auffret, who heads
international affairs for BEUC, the European Consumer Organization. “Putting
them in the middle of a trade war is highly concerning.”
European companies could react to Mr. Trump’s tariffs in a range of ways. Some
pharmaceutical companies trying to dodge the tariffs have already announced
plans to increase production in the United States, which Mr. Trump wants. Others
could decide to move production there later.
Other companies appear to be staying put, but could raise their prices to cover the
tariffs, pushing up costs for patients. And higher prices could affect not only
American consumers, but also patients in Europe. Some companies have begun to
argue that Europe should create more favorable conditions for their businesses by
dismantling some of the rules that keep drug prices down.
Or some middle ground could play out: Companies might shift their financial
profits to the United States for accounting purposes to avoid import charges, even
as they leave their physical factories overseas to avoid the expenses of moving and
challenges of having to set up new supply chains.
Ms. Auffret’s group has already warned European officials that they must not hit
back at an attack on the important industry by tariffing American drugs in return:
Tit for tat would come at too serious of a cost to European consumers.
But the pharmaceutical sector is complicated. Agreements with insurance
companies and government agencies can make it difficult to rapidly adjust prices
for branded drugs, while government regulations can make moving both a
challenge and a long-term commitment. The upshot is that no one can confidently
predict the outcome.

Even as Mr. Trump has paused his so-called “reciprocal” tariffs in favor of an
across-the-board rate of 10 percent during the hiatus, he has left in place some
industry-specific tariffs and made clear that computer chips and pharmaceutical
products would be next. The United States recently kicked off investigations into
both sectors, a first step toward hitting them with tariffs.
Many industry experts expect that the new tariffs could be 25 percent, in line with
those on steel, aluminum and cars.
For the countries at the center of Europe’s drug industry, the possible tariffs are
particularly worrisome. That is especially true for Ireland, where pharmaceuticals
make up 80 percent of all exports to the United States.
Many drug companies originally moved to Ireland because it offers very low
corporate tax rates. But it has also worked to develop its pharmaceutical industry
and offers access to a highly skilled work force.
In recent years, the sector has grown rapidly. More than 90 pharmaceutical
companies are now based there, according to Ireland’s Foreign Direct Investment
Agency, and many of the biggest American drugmakers have operations in the
nation. Last year, Ireland’s pharma industry exported 58 billion euros, or about $66
billion, in pharmaceutical and chemical products to the United States.
“The Irish are smart, yes, smart people,” Mr. Trump said in March, while Prime
Minister Micheál Martin of Ireland was visiting the White House. “You took our
pharmaceutical companies and other companies,” he said. “This beautiful island of
five million people has got the entire U.S. pharmaceutical industry in its grasps.”
Now, tariffs could chip away at the benefits of manufacturing there — which is Mr.
Trump’s goal.
“In the U.S., we don’t make our own drugs anymore,” Mr. Trump said last week
from the Oval Office, adding that “the drug companies are in Ireland.”

Firms are already bracing. Companies have been rushing to export their
pharmaceuticals from Ireland and into the U.S. market before the gauntlet falls,
statistics suggest.
Nor is Ireland the only country affected. Germany, Belgium, Denmark and
Slovenia are also major exporters.
“It’s an enormous issue for Europe,” said Penny Naas, who leads a competitiveness
program for the think tank the German Marshall Fund and has long worked in
European public policy and corporate affairs.
European leaders have been reaching out to both American officials and the
industry. In addition to the Irish prime minister’s recent visit to the Oval Office, the
Irish foreign affairs minister traveled to Washington to meet with the commerce
secretary.
Ursula Von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the European
Union’s executive arm, has met in Brussels with the European Federation of
Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, the lobby group representing
Europe’s biggest drugmakers.
The industry is leveraging the moment to push for wish-list items, like less red
tape.
The European drug lobby group told Ms. von der Leyen that companies could shift
production or investment toward the United States to limit their exposure to Mr.
Trump’s tariffs, especially when faster approvals and easier access to capital are
making America more attractive.
At least 18 members of the group, which includes Bayer, Pfizer and Merck, have
planned nearly €165 billion in investments in the European Union over the next
five years. As much as half of that could shift to the United States, the federation
said. Nor is it alone in that prediction.
“Pharma needs more attractive conditions to produce in Europe,” said Dorothee
Brakmann, the director of Pharma Deutschland, Germany’s largest association of
pharmaceutical companies.
Such warnings seem to have teeth. Some companies have begun to lay out plans to
spend more in the United States; the firm Roche last week announced a $50 billion
American investment plan, the latest in a string of such announcements.
In commentary published last week, the chief executives of Novartis and Sanofi
suggested that less regulation was not enough to stem the bleeding. They argued
that “European price controls and austerity measures reduce the attractiveness of
its markets,” and that the bloc should pave the way for higher prices.

Industry executives have also warned that tariffs on the sector could disrupt
supply lines, impair patient access and dampen research and development.
“There’s a reason” that tariffs on medicines are set to zero, Joaquin Duato, the chief
executive of the drugmaker Johnson & Johnson, said on a recent earnings call. “It’s
because tariffs can create disruptions in the supply chain, leading to shortages.”
Ms. von der Leyen has emphasized similar concerns, warning that tariffs on the
pharmaceutical sector risk “implications for globally interconnected supply chains
and availability of medicines for European and U.S. patients alike.”
Pharmaceutical tariffs also hold another danger for the European Union.
The bloc has been trying to build up its ability to manufacture generic drugs, which
are medically essential but much less profitable than the name-brand products, and
are frequently made in Asia.
But if U.S. tariffs mean that generic drug manufacturers in China and India are
suddenly looking for customers outside of America, it could send a flood of
cheaper-than-usual pills toward Europe.
That could make it even more difficult for the European Union to establish a
domestic manufacturing base for generics, even as tariffs lure name-brand drug
production toward the United States.
“We do think that it’s likely that this is going to cause increased investment in the
U.S.,” said Diederik Stadig, a sectoral economist at ING. “The European
Commission needs to be on the ball.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/world/europe/tariffs-pharmaceuticals-drugs-medicine-trump.html
Andrew Duehren,NYT,1,Business,5/2/2025,Republicans Wrestle With Trump’s Demands for Tax Cuts,"It was easy to miss, but last weekend President Trump floated a fundamental
rewrite of the American tax code. In a social media post, and again in remarks to
reporters, Mr. Trump suggested the United States could stop taxing income under
$200,000 and instead rely on revenue from his extensive tariffs.
“It’ll take a little while before we do that, but we’re going to be cutting taxes, and
it’s possible we’ll do a complete tax cut,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Sunday.
“Because I think the tariffs will be enough to cut all of the income tax.”
The idea was news to Republicans on Capitol Hill already in the throes of
translating Mr. Trump’s impulses for cutting taxes into law.
Senator Mike Crapo, a Republican from Idaho who leads the Finance Committee,
said he had not heard from Mr. Trump or his staff about the proposal. “So I just
don’t know what that’s referencing,” he said.
Likewise in the House, where Republicans are preparing to release their first stab
at the tax bill in the coming days. “We aren’t having that discussion at all — it’s
never come up,” Representative Lloyd Smucker, a Republican from Pennsylvania
and a member of the Ways and Means committee, said of not collecting income
taxes on earnings under $200,000.
Even if they take a pass on Mr. Trump’s most recent notion, congressional
Republicans are straining to incorporate several of his previous tax proposals into
the legislation. Those include not taxing tips, overtime pay or Social Security
benefits, three of Mr. Trump’s campaign pledges that the White House has
continued to push in his second term.
House Republicans are planning to include those ideas in their version of the bill,
though their proposals are expected to be narrower than the blanket tax
exemptions Mr. Trump has advertised, according to lawmakers, staff and lobbyists
after the talks. Mr. Trump’s other ideas from the campaign trail, like allowing
Americans to deduct the cost of buying a generator, seem very likely to fall by the
way side.
While Republicans acknowledge they’ll now probably have to pass at least a couple
of Mr. Trump’s tax proposals, some still grouse about them.
“My beef with what’s being proposed right now, there’s no guiding principle other
than, ‘well, this is what President Trump promised on the campaign,’” said Senator
Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin. “I understand the political message
there, but let’s keep our tax code simple. I’d much rather lower the rates and keep
it simple, rather than do another little special carve-out deal.”
As with all of the tax cuts Republicans are considering, a chief concern about Mr.
Trump’s ideas is their cost. Without steps to curb their reach, the cost of the
campaign promises could balloon into the trillions, according to estimates from the
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Republicans are trying to limit how much they add to the deficit with the
legislation, forcing a parallel and politically treacherous negotiation over cuts to
spending on Medicaid and other programs that help low-income Americans. How
far Republicans can cut taxes, and what Mr. Trump’s ideas look like in practice, will
depend on how much in spending Republicans can ultimately agree to cut.
“I want to make sure that we get tax relief for hardworking Americans, which
seems to be the focus of those, but there is a finite amount of money as well,”
Senator Roger Marshall, a Republican from Kansas, said of Mr. Trump’s campaign
promises. “So I think the big debate is: How much money does the House want to
save?”
The leading proposal for not taxing tips — a bill crafted by Senator Ted Cruz,
Republican of Texas, and Representative Vern Buchanan, Republican of Florida —
would take a number of steps to limit the scope of the tax break.
Under their bill, Americans making more than a threshold that rises annually, set
at $160,000 this year, would still have to pay taxes on their tipped income. People
making under that limit would avoid income taxes only on the first $25,000 in tips
they receive, though they would still owe payroll taxes. To prevent all types of
workers from trying to claim the tax break, the bill tasks the Treasury Department
with limiting it to people in industries that traditionally receive tips.
It also excludes gig workers from the tax break. Some companies, including the
food-delivery service DoorDash, are lobbying for lawmakers to expand the tax
break to independent contractors. The company has invited its drivers, who work
as independent contractors rather than traditional employees, to write to members
of Congress about the issue, with nearly 40,000 of them doing so already.
“This is a matter of basic fairness — tips are tips,” Max Rettig, global head of public
policy at DoorDash, said in a statement.
While the details for not taxing tips are up in the air, Republicans expect their bill to
ultimately include limitations similar to what Mr. Cruz and Mr. Buchanan had in
their bill. Lawmakers said they were also trying to make sure the tax exemption
for overtime pay was targeted toward middle-and-low income Americans — and
would not create a gold rush in tax dodging for rich Americans. To hold down costs,
Republicans may approve the tax breaks only for the duration of Mr. Trump’s term.
Mr. Trump’s wish to not tax Social Security benefits is more complicated.
Republicans are using a special procedure called reconciliation to pass the tax
legislation without Democratic support. Reconciliation requires lawmakers to
follow a series of rules, one of which is that bills considered under the process
cannot affect Social Security’s finances.
To work around that prohibition, House Republicans, rather than directly changing
how Social Security benefits are taxed, are preparing to offer a more general tax
break to older Americans. Americans over 65 are already eligible for a slightly
larger standard deduction, and Republicans have considered a further expansion.
“If we can do a deduction that erases the tax burden that our seniors pay on their
Social Security income, for people within a certain income threshold, it equates to
the same thing,” said Representative Nicole Malliotakis, a New York Republican
and member of the Ways and Means Committee. “It’s eliminating their tax burden.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/republicans-trump-tax-cuts.html
Eshe Nelson,NYT,1,Business,4/28/2025,U.S. Dollar’s Weakness Creates an Opportunity for the Euro. Can It Last?,"President Trump’s shake-up of the global trade system has sent tremors through
the long-held view that the United States is the source of the world’s safest
financial assets. That’s  created an opportunity for Europe.
The market tumult in which investors simultaneously sold off the U.S. dollar,
American stocks and U.S. Treasury bonds eased last week as Mr. Trump backed off
his threats to fire the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, and Treasury
Secretary Scott Bessent tried to reassure foreign officials that trade deals would be
struck.
But many European officials attending the spring meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington last week were skeptical that the
uncertainty over Mr. Trump’s trade policy would dissipate any time soon. They said

the unpredictable nature of the Trump administration’s approach to setting policy
would not easily be forgotten. Instead, they saw the potential to attract investors to
European assets, from the euro to the bond market.
“We see that our stability, predictability and respect for the rule of law is already
proving a strength,” Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner responsible
for the trade bloc’s economy, said on Wednesday in a discussion on the sidelines of
the I.M.F. meetings. “We already have stronger investor interest in euro-
denominated assets.”
The most comprehensive indication that funds are flowing to Europe: Since the
beginning of April, the euro has gained 5.4 percent against the dollar, rising above
$1.13, the highest level since late 2021.
The question among policymakers and investors is whether the recent jump in the
euro and other euro-denominated assets is simply a short-term rebalancing of
portfolios that heavily favored the dollar or the beginning of a long-term trend in
which the euro firmly encroaches on the dollar’s role as the world’s dominant
currency.
A troubled past
“There’s a lot of enthusiasm about Europe,” Kristin J. Forbes, an economist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an interview.
She said the excitement about the euro reminded her of the currency’s founding in
1999, when some economists and policymakers raised the prospect of it replacing
the dollar. In its early years, the euro’s international use exceeded the combined
use of the currencies it replaced.
But then the euro was hit by crises. Despite having a monetary union of a dozen
members, including Germany, Europe’s largest economy, the region remained
politically fragmented, sapping confidence in the currency. The sovereign debt
crisis in 2012, followed by a decade of ultra low interest rates, meant the region’s
bonds offered low returns.
The euro is now used by 20 member countries and represents about 20 percent of
the world’s central banks foreign exchange reserves, a figure that has barely
budged in the past two decades. Thirty percent of global exports are invoiced in
euros, whereas more than half are in dollars.
Many European officials at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank
meetings in Washington were skeptical that the uncertainty over the U.S. trade policy
would dissipate any time soon. Jose Luis Magana/Associated Press
Speculation about new dominant currencies should be taken “cautiously,” Ms.
Forbes said, but there is more momentum behind the euro.
“This feels like it does have more legs because it is a combination of a stronger,
more unified Europe,” she said. “At the same time, there are more problems
emerging with U.S. dollar assets.”
Improvements have been made on some of the issues that previously deterred
foreign investors. Today, European bonds are providing better returns, and
investors trust that the European Central Bank will be the lender of last resort,
minimizing the risk that one country’s economic troubles could affect all euro
assets.
More safe assets
For investors, the most promising new development is the prospect of Germany
issuing about 1 trillion euros in additional government debt, known as bunds and
considered the safest euro-denominated assets.
For years, Germany’s strict fiscal conservatism has restrained the supply of bunds.
But last month, Parliament altered the borrowing limits anchored in its
constitution, the so-called debt brake, to allow the government to borrow hundreds
of millions of euros to invest in the military and infrastructure.
“There are cheers in Europe” because of Germany’s fiscal stimulus, said Kristalina
Georgieva, the I.M.F. managing director. “And it adds something that is not
tangible, but it is important — confidence.”
The demand for German debt has preceded any additional issuance. During the
recent market turmoil, bund prices rose, pushing down the yields, a clear sign of
investor interest. At the same time, yields on U.S. government bonds have moved
in the other direction. By the end of last week, the yield on 10-year bunds was 2.47
percent, reversing nearly all the increase that followed the stimulus
announcement.
Investors are also anticipating an increase in debt issued jointly by European
governments, an idea that has been proposed to finance more military spending
across the bloc. Economists have pointed out that this happened before: The
European Union issued more than 600 billion euros in bonds to finance post-
pandemic recovery programs. But that borrowing faced fierce opposition, and
future issuance would also struggle to win the backing of all the member states.
Although there has been confusion and frustration with Mr. Trump’s trade policies,
many European officials, including central bankers, emphasized the need for
Europe to seize this moment.
“This will be a time of creativity and pragmatism, getting things moving,” Olli
Rehn, the governor of the Finnish central bank, said in a speech. “I am very much
looking forward to this period as a positive challenge because we are very serious
about reinforcing common defense in Europe. Which will, by the way, need safe
assets.”
‘A long and hard road’
Optimism is growing about the role of the euro. Klaas Knot, the governor of the
Dutch central bank, said he had gone from being agnostic about the international
use of the euro to a “cautious believer.”
But he added that “the external strength” of the euro “is a reflection of internal
strength” in Europe, and governments need to go further to increase that strength,
he said in a speech on the sidelines of the meetings in Washington.
Officials must continue to deepen the single market that connects the bloc’s more
than 448 million people and enable them to trade and do businesses freely, Mr. Knot
said. Lawmakers, he said, also needed to build a single capital market that would
make it easier for money to cross European borders. “We still have quite some
work to do in Europe.”
Alfred Kammer, the director of the I.M.F.’s European department, warned against
“over-interpreting” the recent shift toward the euro. A “move to European
exceptionalism,” he said, is “still a long and hard road away.”
The region, he said, needed many more structural changes that would enable a
more dynamic business sector in which companies could reach larger markets and
pools of capital.
Many officials said it was more likely that the euro would be one of several assets
that become more prominent as investors reduce their holdings in dollars. In
recent weeks, for example, the price of gold has soared, exceeding $3,300 per troy
ounce, and the Swiss franc has also surged, gaining nearly 7 percent against the
dollar this month.
“I don’t see everyone massively getting out of dollars and suddenly shifting to the
euro; I think it’s more a healthy diversification,” Ms. Forbes said. But private
investors abroad who have built up a lot of holdings in U.S. debt and are now
watching the dollar decline want alternatives.
“Europe,” she added, “is a natural place to diversify.”

Julie Creswell;Danielle Kaye,NYT,1,Business,4/24/2025,Pepsico Cuts Growth Forecast Amid Tariffs and Slowed Consumer Spending,"Consumers, worried about the economy, are pulling back on their spending, and
that anxiety is translating into lower sales and profits for some of the country’s
largest consumer-oriented companies.
On Thursday, PepsiCo cut its full-year guidance outlook, citing a reduction in
consumer spending as well as the impact the company is feeling from increased
global tariffs.
“Relative to where we were three months ago, we probably aren’t feeling as good
about the consumer now,” Jamie Caulfield, the chief financial officer of PepsiCo,
told Wall Street analysts and investors on an earnings call Thursday morning.
The company, which manufactures Pepsi and Gatorade drinks as well as popular
snacks like Doritos and Cheetos, cut its profit forecast for the full year to flat from
its earlier guidance that expected earnings growth to be in the mid-single digits. It

reported a decline of 1.8 percent in revenue, to $17.9 billion, for the quarter that
ended March 22, and a drop of 10 percent in net income, to $1.8 billion, from a year
earlier.
PepsiCo’s stock fell more than 4 percent, to $136, by early afternoon.
Comments made on PepsiCo’s earnings call echoed what executives at other
consumer companies have said in recent days about how apprehension in the
global economy is key to less consumer spending. The pullback has started to
weigh on some companies’ revenues and dampen their outlook for the coming
months, especially as they try to calculate the costs they’ll incur from the Trump
administration’s new or increased tariffs on imported goods.

At Chipotle, same-store sales fell for the first time since 2020 in the most recent
quarter, the chain reported this week. Uncertainty about the path forward for the
U.S. economy started to affect spending in February, the company said, shortly
after President Trump’s inauguration — a trend that continued into April.

“It was all around this idea of saving money, economic uncertainty — they’re
eating at home more frequently than they’re eating out,” Scott Boatwright, the
burrito chain’s chief executive, said when asked about consumer behavior. The
underlying trend, he added, is “really tied to the consumer sitting on the sideline.”
Chipotle also lowered its full-year guidance. Beyond sluggish consumer spending,
the chain said it expected Mr. Trump’s tariffs imposed in April — a broad 10 percent
duty on many imports and tariffs on aluminum — to raise the company’s food,
beverage and packaging costs this year.
Another signal of distress among shoppers: Consumers are doing less laundry to
scale back on detergent purchases, an executive from Procter & Gamble, which
makes household staples like Tide detergent, told Yahoo Finance.
On Thursday, P.&G. cut its full-year outlook and said whiplash on tariff policy had
factored into a “pause” in consumption as consumers also tried to make sense of
stock market volatility and job market uncertainty, said Andre Schulten, the
company’s chief financial officer.
Signs that economic concerns are starting to affect consumer spending are
appearing in the airline industry, too. American Airlines pulled its full-year
guidance on Thursday, mirroring a move last month from Delta Air Lines. Robert
Isom, the chief executive of American Airlines, told CNBC on Thursday that
domestic leisure travel “fell off considerably” starting in February.
The most recent survey from the Conference Board showed consumer confidence
tumbling in March to its lowest level since January 2021. Americans are
increasingly anxious about their jobs and finances, the business group reported.
Hoping to entice consumers who are tightening wallets, executives at PepsiCo said
it was offering less expensive, under $2, individual bags of snacks along with
smaller snack packs in stores.
PepsiCo said it had calculated into its lower profit estimates the higher costs
associated with the tariffs. “We also factored in some of our mitigation plans, some
we will be able to execute more quickly than others,” Mr. Caulfield said on the call
on Thursday.
Analysts had been keeping a close eye on the impact that tariffs would have on the
food and beverage industry, specifically a 25 percent tariff on imported aluminum.
And while Wall Street analysts have been watching for potential fallout of the
Trump administration’s trade wars on sales of American brands in key
international markets, specifically Europe and China, PepsiCo said its global
markets performed well in the first quarter.
In the United States, the popularity of using Ozempic and other weight-loss drugs
has curbed sales for snacks and shifted purchases to smaller portions, Ramon
Laguarta, the chief executive of PepsiCo, told analysts.
PepsiCo is also navigating demands by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
This week, Mr. Kennedy declared that “sugar is poison” during a news conference
and said he had “an understanding” with major food manufacturers to remove
petroleum-based food colorings from their products by the end of 2026.
Mr. Laguarta said that PepsiCo had been an industry leader in reducing sodium
and sugar in products and that more than 60 percent of its business was from
products with no artificial colors. In the next few years, he added, the company will
have “migrated all the portfolio into natural colors or at least provide the consumer
with natural color options.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/business/pepsico-earnings-economy-tariffs.html
Clay Risen,NYT,1,Business,4/25/2025,Whiskey Fraud Strikes Britain and Ireland,"There are some 48,000 barrels of Scotch whisky quietly aging in Martin
Armstrong’s warehouses in southwestern Scotland. Last year, 17 of them became a
problem.
Mr. Armstrong normally deals with companies that buy hundreds of barrels at a
time from distilleries, then pay him to store them as they age. In July, he started
getting desperate calls from people who had bought just one or two barrels from an
investment outfit called Cask Whisky Limited. They had been told that some of
those barrels were stored in Mr. Armstrong’s warehouse.
Cask Whisky had promised those investors sky-high returns. But when the
company collapsed last year, it left them scrambling to find their barrels.
“We were inundated by questions,” Mr. Armstrong said.
He couldn’t help most of them. He had never even done business with Cask
Whisky. Still, Mr. Armstrong knew exactly what he was dealing with: yet another
in a growing number of Scotch whisky-investment scams.
A New, Full-Bodied Fraud
Comes in a Whisky Barrel
Barrel-investment scams have taken off in recent years, Mr. Armstrong said, because
the rapid rise in the price of luxury whisky makes investors willing to overlook red

There are dozens of companies like Cask Whisky, often located in London but
selling barrels stored in remote corners of Scotland and Ireland, making it hard for
clients to see their investments in person. Some are semi-legitimate operations
that sell barrels at prices so inflated they will take decades to turn a profit; others
are practicing outright fraud.
“There’s a whole range of different types of cask scams, from the mild to the just
evil,” said Isabel Graham-Yooll, a whisky consultant in London. “It’s a murky old
world.”
The City of London Police said it received 89 reports of alcohol investment fraud in
2023, the most recent data available, amounting to nearly $4 million in lost money.
Those numbers are set to grow, experts warn, as the global economy teeters and
people become more aware of the risks involved in barrel investing and try to get
out. Many are about to realize that what they took to be a sound investment is
anything but.
“I personally think that we’re at the beginning of what’s going to be a major
industry crisis,” said Felipe Schrieberg, a journalist and a founder of the consumer-
awareness website Protect Your Cask. “Bloodbath has been the word that I’ve been
using.”
As a rule, whisky barrels gain in value the longer they age: The taste of the liquid
improves, while slow evaporation means there is less of it each year. As a result,
barrels have long been a favored commodity among fraudsters, who promise big
returns to unsuspecting investors. But for several reasons, the scams have picked
up in earnest over the last five years.
Whisky gains much of its value through aging, and in Scotland that can mean waiting

For one thing, near-zero interest rates pushed investors to seek out better returns
than banks could offer. Government-issued stimulus checks during the Covid
pandemic gave British taxpayers money to play with. And sophisticated marketing
tools allowed companies to pinpoint promising demographics — often retirees with
a nest egg and a poor grasp of the risks involved.
All this happened at a time when the valuations for top-rated single-malt Scotch
were skyrocketing. In a 2023 report on so-called passion assets by the Knight
Frank Luxury Investment Index, rare whisky grew 428 percent in value over the
previous 10 years, far more than products like wine and watches.
Investment companies took such numbers and blasted them across Facebook and
Google Ads, reeling in thousands of hapless clients.
“The biggest problem is that people are so desperate to make an investment that
the fear of missing out means that they bypass all logical safety checks,” Mr.
Armstrong said.
To insiders like Mr. Armstrong, the red flags are obvious. A new barrel of whisky
should cost less than $1,000 before a reasonable markup, but these companies often
sell them for as much as six times that amount.
They tout access to highly regarded distilleries like Linkwood and Deanston,
without explaining that the barrels frequently come with trademark protections
that forbid using the distilleries’ names, which significantly reduces their value.
And the investment companies often issue ownership documents that leave out key
details, like the date of distillation, making it hard for buyers to track down their
barrels among the estimated 22 million stored around Scotland.
“I think part of it is that romance of whisky, the romance of having your own cask
in a warehouse, that makes people let their guards down,” said Mr. Schrieberg, the
journalist.
Very few barrels achieve the characteristics required to fetch high prices, a fact that barrel-investment

Even the promise of steady, elevated returns is largely a myth. Value growth in
whisky is not linear; a four-year-old barrel is not worth much more than a three-
year-old one, and barrels reach premium status only at around 18 years old.
And only a vanishingly small number of barrels produce whisky with the right
aroma and taste to fetch the sort of five-figure prices that investment companies
often promise. There is simply no way of knowing whether a particular barrel, on
the day it is filled, will ever reach that height.
“It’s like saying this specific blue paint was used by Picasso, this particular Picasso
painting made with that blue paint went up 1,000 percent, ergo, if you buy this tub
of blue paint, it is going to go up that same percent,” said Blair Bowman, a whisky
broker who has been critical of the barrel-investment business.
Making the hard sell for bad investments isn’t necessarily illegal. But several
companies are clearly committing fraud.
Mr. Armstrong requires barrel owners to tell him when they sell to third parties,
but neither the original owners, nor Cask Whisky, informed him about their sales.
As he tried to piece together what had happened, he realized that the company had
likely sold the same barrels to multiple people, or sold barrels that didn’t exist in
the first place.
In March, the BBC produced an exposé about the barrel-investment industry,
including interviews with investors who had put hundreds of thousands of pounds
into schemes that turned sour. The BBC also reported that the London police were
investigating Cask Whisky Limited and two similar operations, Cask Spirits Global
Limited and Whisky Scotland, for fraud.
But enforcement is rare. In Britain, the financial authorities don’t regulate barrels
as investments, offering little protection for buyers. And the line between high-
pressure salesmanship and fraud is a blurry one, though in some cases the
country’s Advertising Standards Authority has gone after companies for
misleading marketing.
Investors have slim chances of recovering their money. In March, Britain’s
Insolvency Office, the government agency that is shutting down Cask Whisky, sent
out a memo telling investors that it couldn’t help them recover their barrels; all it
could offer was a list of email addresses for warehouses where those barrels might
sit.
Isabel Graham-Yooll, a whisky industry consultant, said Britain lacks strong
protections against barrel-investment scams. “We’re just all waiting for someone to

“There’s this kind of superhero complex, where we’re just all waiting for someone
to come in and fix things,” Ms. Graham-Yooll said.
The problem is largely specific to Scotland and Ireland, where the buying and
selling of barrels among businesses is a longstanding practice. It is less of an issue
in the United States, where it’s harder for individual buyers to purchase barrels
and where the Securities and Exchange Commission often regulates the sale of
barrels as investments.
To be fair, some barrel-investment companies are legitimate, and may even offer a
realistic way to turn a long-term profit. But the industry is so complex and scams
so plentiful that experts advise staying away.
“In theory, there is a world in which buying casks by the general public could
work,” Mr. Schrieberg said. “But if you’re a Joe Public, I’d recommend don’t get
involved. It’s just too high-risk and there’s too much ugly stuff going on.”

Stocks rose on Thursday, marking a third consecutive daily rally as investors hope
for an easing of President Trump’s trade wars and weigh comments from a Federal
Reserve official on tariffs’ economic impacts.
The S&P 500 gained 2 percent after stalling in early trading. The index has
seesawed this week: Monday saw a sharp sell-off, followed by three days of sizable
gains after President Trump on Tuesday said that he was prepared to be “very
nice” in trade negotiations with China.
The rally then paused after officials in China said they were not holding talks with
the United States about easing trade tensions. But indexes continued to swing on
scraps of information about tariffs and monetary policy, in the absence of concrete
developments about the escalating global trade war.
On Thursday, Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, told Bloomberg that the
economic hit from Mr. Trump’s tariffs would take time to show up in the data,
suggesting that the central bank was not poised to lower interest rates soon. But
when asked what would prompt him to favor a rate cut, Mr. Waller said: “If I saw
enough movement in the unemployment rate to make me think that things were
going bad, or growth prospects started tanking, or consumer spending started
really going down, then I’d be ready to go.”
He Yadong, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Commerce, said on Thursday that
“there are currently no economic and trade negotiations between China and the
United States, and any claims about progress in China-U.S. economic and trade
negotiations are baseless rumors without factual evidence.”
A spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Guo Jiakun, reiterated China’s
stance, which is that the tariff war was started by the United States and that China
would only engage in talks under certain conditions. “China’s attitude is consistent

and clear: If you want to fight, we will fight to the end; if you want to talk, the door
is open,” he said.
The day before, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed speculation that Mr.
Trump was considering unilaterally lowering tariffs on China and emphasized that
any moves to de-escalate trade tensions would need to be mutual. “I don’t think
either side believes that the current tariff levels are sustainable,” he said.
In other developments on Thursday:
Big companies reporting their latest earnings warned that tariffs and economic
uncertainty would dent profits in the months ahead. PepsiCo and Merck cut their
earnings forecasts, while American Airlines withdrew its previous forecast for the
rest of the year, until “the economic outlook becomes clearer.”
A rise in major technology stocks boosted the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite
index, which gained 2.7 percent for the day. Shares in Amazon were up more than
3 percent, as were shares in the chip giant Nvidia.
The U.S. dollar fell against several major currencies, including the euro, the
British pound and the Japanese yen.
The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, which move inversely to prices, fell to 4.31
percent.
Oil futures recovered some ground, with Brent crude up about 0.4 percent, to
more than $66 a barrel.

Adeel Hassan,NYT,1,Business,4/26/2025,Ex-Disney Worker Who Hacked Menus Gets 3 Years in Prison,"A former employee of Walt Disney World who hacked into menus used by its
restaurants and edited them — changing prices, adding profanity and altering
listed allergens — was sentenced to three years in prison by a federal judge in
Florida this week.
None of the changes, including falsified information about food allergens that could
have been harmful to visitors, ever appeared before the public, according to court
records. The menu alterations were caught and court records show that none of the
changes ever reached the printing stage.
The former employee, Michael Scheuer of Winter Garden, Fla., was sentenced on
Wednesday in federal court in Orlando, Fla., after pleading guilty in January to one
count of computer fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft.
Mr. Scheuer, 40, was ordered to pay restitution of about $620,000 to Disney and
$70,000 to the unidentified software company that provides Disney with its menu
creation program.
While court documents do not mention Disney World, menus that were entered
into evidence in Mr. Scheuer’s case are from the hundreds of restaurants at Walt
Disney World in Orlando.
Disney World representatives did not respond to messages seeking comment.
In early June 2024, Mr. Scheuer had returned from paternity leave, court
documents show. A few days later, he had an argument with a supervisor about
menu creation, according to the documents, and he was told that he would be
suspended.
Instead, he was fired for unspecified misconduct, the documents state.
An investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation later revealed that,
beginning around that time and over approximately the next three months, there
were multiple hacks into servers that hosted the menu creation program.
Those changes included price cuts or hikes of a few dollars, profanities and altering
allergens in certain items.
On a drink called the “Giddy-Up” — a blend of vodka, lemonade and iced tea — he
lowered the price by $2, according to court records, and took two ounces off a 10-
ounce filet mignon. In another instance, “shellfish” was changed to “hellfish.”
On a couple of menus, either the prices or the descriptions of the items
disappeared.
He changed a wine region — Golden, Colo. — to the location of a mass shooting,
Aurora, Colo. He also edited “Infamous Goose” — high-quality imported wine from
New Zealand — to “Infamous Moose.”
More crucially, Mr. Scheuer edited certain menu items, falsely showing that they
were safe for people with allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish and milk,
according to his plea agreement.
Prosecutors said “the discreet way in which these changes were made was likely
by design, specifically to avoid detection.”
But Mr. Scheuer’s lawyer, David Haas, said that his client had only been trying to
get the attention of Disney so that it would respond to him.
“He knew the menu changes would be identified in Disney’s extensive menu
review process,” Mr. Haas said in a court document.
Disney had indeed noticed, and it had contacted the F.B.I., identifying Mr. Scheuer
as a possible suspect. In September, the F.B.I. executed a search warrant at Mr.
Scheuer’s home and seized several electronic devices.
The criminal complaint also shows that Mr. Scheuer blocked 14 Disney employees
from their company accounts through denial-of-service attacks. Some of the
targeted workers were former colleagues involved in his firing, according to court
records.
On one occasion, Mr. Scheuer drove to the home of one of the targeted employees
shortly before 11 p.m., walked to the front door and gave a thumbs-up to the Ring
doorbell camera before leaving, court records show.
Gregory W. Kehoe, the interim U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Florida, said
that Mr. Scheuer’s actions were at least partly attributable to a mental health
episode. Prosecutors asked for a 70-month sentence.
Mr. Haas said in an interview on Friday that “Mr. Scheuer remains remorseful and
apologetic to his former co-workers,” adding that he was grateful to the judge for
imposing only a 36-month sentence.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/26/us/disney-worker-prison-

Updated April 28, 2025
There was a line of hundreds of people in front of the Pop Mart store in Los Angeles
at 4:45 a.m. on Friday.
Korin Reese arrived thinking she was somewhat early and was stunned to find
customers already waiting. Some brought stools and foldable chairs to sit on, while
others came with bags full of snacks and drinks. Ms. Reese heard that some of the
people in line had been there since 10 p.m. the day before.
They, like Ms. Reese, wanted to get their hands on the latest series of a new key-
ring doll called the Labubu, which is sold exclusively at Pop Mart, a Chinese
collectibles retailer. The dolls, which belong to a tribe called The Monsters, are the
latest in a long line of iconic collectible characters from Asia, including Hello Kitty
— now a 50-year-old matriarch — Sonny Angel and Gudetama.
Labubu dolls are fuzzy little Nordic elves with snaggletoothed, mischievous grins
and impish ears. They’re all female, they’re kindhearted, but sometimes, as they go
about spreading joy, they get into trouble. “Well-intentioned” trouble, though, said
Emily Brough, head of licensing at Pop Mart North America. “It’s never malicious.”
How These Little Elves Turned Into a
Global Sensation
The creatures, conceptualized in 2015 by an artist born in Hong Kong, Kasing Lung,
began as characters in a children’s book series. In 2019, Mr. Lung signed a
partnership with Pop Mart to turn the storybook elves into collectible designer
toys, starting with a line of figurines. Pop Mart’s first Labubu key-ring series,
called the Exciting Macaron, was released in October 2023.
Each time a new Labubu has been released, it has sold out within minutes online.
(Each doll costs roughly $30, but some limited-edition items can cost more.) They
have spawned communities — in real life and online, where fans discuss tips on
how to score dolls or dress them up and share images of their collections — and
have turned into unexpected fashion accessories, often juxtaposed against luxury
handbags.
Labubu dolls, like this one from the Let’s Checkmate
collection, typically sell out within minutes of being
released online. Pop Mart
The success of Pop Mart, the Chinese company behind the brand, has been
somewhat recession-proof, according to Bloomberg, with its stock and profits
rallying despite global economic uncertainty and trade war concerns. The
company reported $1.8 billion in revenue in 2024 — a more than 100 percent
increase from the previous year. The Labubu dolls and The Monsters tribe
contributed about $400 million in revenue last year — a growth of 726 percent from
the previous year — making it among the company’s top-selling products.
It was last year when the popularity of the dolls really took off, crossing over from
the world of niche hobby collecting into the mainstream. Last spring, Lisa, a
member of the pop group Blackpink and one of the stars of “White Lotus,” posted a
picture of her Labubu dangling off a Louis Vuitton bag on her Instagram story. And
in the fall, she opened up about her obsession with Pop Mart and the dolls in an
interview with Vanity Fair. “I spent all my money” at these stores, she told the
magazine.
Then in February, the pop star and fashion icon Rihanna was spotted with a
Labubu, also clipped onto her Louis Vuitton bag; the singer Dua Lipa was seen
with one, too. This week, the actress Emma Roberts posted an Instagram story of
her latest haul of four Labubu dolls, set to the Britney Spears song “Oops! ... I Did
It Again.” In March, Pop Mart opened a pop-up store at the British luxury
department store Harrods, leading to lines of fans snaking around Knightsbridge,
eager to get the doll.
One of the ways Pop Mart has built interest in the dolls is by releasing some of
them in a “blind box” so that buyers don’t know which doll is hidden inside. That
distribution strategy is what “keeps fans interested” and constantly on their toes,
said Joshua Paul Dale, the author of “Irresistible: How Cuteness Wired Our Brains
and Conquered the World.”
In December, it was that mysterious hype that got Martin Andre Navarro
Nibungco, a 22-year-old musician, stopped at an airport. He was returning from a
vacation in Bangkok to his home in Los Angeles with 12 Labubu dolls in his
suitcase to gift to his friends. He had to transfer to a domestic flight at the San
Francisco airport and, while going through airport security, six Transportation
Security Administration agents descended on his suitcase and took him aside.
“Everyone was like, ‘Oh, my god, we need to know what you guys got? What do
you think you guys got?’” Mr. Navarro Nibungco said in a phone interview. He
opened his suitcase, and “one of the agents took one of the boxes through the X-
ray,” he said.
When Mr. Navarro Nibungco carries his Labubu around (he clips it to his belt
loop), he has found that it often serves as a fun conversation starter with strangers.
“The association with the Labubus is only comfort,” and it opens the door to a
harmless, politics-free chat, he said. It’s “escapism.”

“People are patiently waiting and are willing to pay 20-something bucks despite
whatever is going on with the world right now,” he said. “That says something.”
In response to the Labubu craze, entire mini industries have sprung up on sites like
Etsy and AliExpress, where creators sell tiny outfits specifically designed for the
dolls, car seats for them to sit in and even little handbags for them to carry.
At 10 p.m. Eastern on Thursday, the day before the new Labubu line was to release
in U.S. stores, the dolls were supposed to drop online. But the Pop Mart website
and app crashed because they were inundated with more traffic than the company
had prepared for, Pop Mart said in an email. On Reddit, users shared that they
were panicking and fervently refreshing the website.
When the site and app were back up, the dolls had already sold out.
“So I was like, you know what? I’m just going to go down and actually try to
physically pick these up,” Ms. Reese, 42, a financial planner in retail, said in a
phone interview. “I expected there to be a line but I didn’t think it was going to be
that serious,” she said, adding that it was “literally the Hunger Games.” There were
long lines at other Pop Mart locations as well.
At one point, the crowd in Los Angeles was growing restless, Ms. Reese said, with
people pushing one another to reach the front. Amid the chaos, a woman in front of
her fell to the floor. In the end, Ms. Reese left empty-handed. It didn’t matter — she
already had six dolls at home.
Online, too, many Labubu enthusiasts — who speculated that bots buying up the
inventory to resell it were responsible for crashing the website — felt defeated
when they couldn’t score a doll. “DID WE WASTE AT LEAST AN HOUR OF OUR
TIME WAITING FOR THE ADORABLE STUPID LITTLE COLLECTABLE
DOLLS,” one user wrote in a post. “Yes.”
“Twas a hard battle,” the user wrote, “but we must play the waiting game now.”

Every Monday, Maurine Gentis, a retired teacher, waits for a delivery from Meals
on Wheels South Texas.
“The meals help stretch my budget,” Ms. Gentis, 77, said. Living alone and in a
wheelchair, she appreciates having someone look in on her regularly. The same
group, a nonprofit, delivers books from the library and dry food for her cat.
But Ms. Gentis is anxious about what lies ahead. The small government agency
responsible for overseeing programs like Meals on Wheels is being dismantled as
part of the Trump administration’s overhaul of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services. Roughly half its staff has been let go in recent layoffs and all of its
10 regional offices are closed, according to several employees who lost their jobs.
“I’m just kind of worried that the whole thing might go down the drain, too,” Ms.
Gentis said.
In President Trump’s quest to end what he termed “illegal and immoral
discrimination programs,” one of his executive orders promoted cracking down on
federal efforts to improve accessibility and representation for those with
disabilities, with agencies flagging words like “accessible” and “disability” as
potentially problematic. Certain research studies are no longer being funded, and
many government health employees specializing in disability issues have been
fired.
The downsizing of the agency, the Administration for Community Living, is part of
far-reaching cuts planned at the H.H.S. under the Trump administration’s proposed
budget.
While some federal funding may continue through September, the end of the
government’s fiscal year, and some workers have been called back temporarily,
there is significant uncertainty about the future. And some groups are reporting
delays in receiving expected federal funds.
Maurine Gentis of Victoria, Texas, who receives Meals on Wheels deliveries. “I’m just
kind of worried that the whole thing might go down the drain, too,” Ms. Gentis said.

“There’s a lot of confusion,” said Becky Yanni, the executive director of the Council
on Aging in St. Johns County in Florida. She said she has been told that the most
recent funding for its Meals on Wheels program and other services might be late.
If the funding does not arrive, “in a lot of communities, you will be looking at cuts in
services,” said Sandy Markwood, the chief executive officer for USAging, which
represents the network of area agencies of aging.
The community living division helps coordinate services and provide funding for
older and disabled Americans so they can stay at home rather than live in a
nursing home. With a budget of $2.6 billion, the unit represents a minuscule
fraction of total H.H.S. spending.
Under the reorganization introduced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,
the community unit’s responsibilities will be divided among other agencies,
including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Administration
for Children and Families.
“This consolidation allows the department to better meet the current health needs
of vulnerable populations across the country,” a spokeswoman for H.H.S. said in a
statement. “This does not impact the important work of these critical programs as
it will continue elsewhere within H.H.S.”
So far, several programs under the unit will be eliminated under the proposed
budget, including one that provides ombudsmen in nursing homes, to help ensure
the safety and welfare of residents, and respite care programs, to provide a break
for those caring for an older person or person with disabilities. States would also
have more latitude in determining where funds should be allocated.
In addition to meal deliveries, the community living agency supports numerous
programs, including the nonprofit Centers for Independent Living, that are staffed
by people with disabilities, who help older adults and others with disabilities move
out of nursing homes and back into the community, and find services, like
transportation and legal assistance.
Theo W. Braddy, the executive director for the National Council on Independent
Living, which represents the centers and people with disabilities, said the
uncertainty has upended planning.
“Everybody is on edge. We can’t tell them anything because we don’t know
anything yet,” he said, adding that no one from the Trump administration or H.H.S.
has attempted to contact the group with updates.

Advocates say the recent cutbacks have further marginalized older Americans and
those with disabilities. “The bottom line is that people in charge simply don’t care
about large swaths of the American people,” said Dr. Joanne Lynne, a clinical
professor of geriatrics and palliative care at George Washington University.
“We have made living with disability and old age exceedingly unpleasant,” she
said. “We are on course to make it virtually intolerable.”
Community groups like Meals on Wheels are bracing for significant cuts. In
addition to the potential loss of funding from the Administration for Community
Living, Republican lawmakers are proposing reducing grants to states that use
another stream of federal funding. The Trump administration and Republicans are
also pushing for significant cuts to the Medicaid program, which provides heath
care coverage for low-income Americans.
“We’re concerned about a number of potential threats happening all at once,” said
Josh Protas, the chief advocacy and policy officer for Meals on Wheels America, an
association of the local nonprofits. About a third of the association’s local units
already have waiting lists, he said, and lower funding would result in fewer meals
for fewer people.

People who are 60 or older with low incomes, and who have difficulty preparing
food for themselves, typically qualify for Meals on Wheels. The demand for
services is increasing as food prices rise and more people need assistance. More
than two million older Americans receive food deliveries each year, and many say
they would have difficulty paying for meals without the program.
“Meals on Wheels is a godsend for me,” said Richard Beatty, a 70-year-old with
poor vision and limited mobility living in Baltimore. He receives deliveries four
times a week and isn’t sure how he would manage without the program.
If there are cuts in funding, the programs would have to make hard choices about
who would be eligible for deliveries. “We would have to make drastic changes to
who we were serving,” said Dan Capone, the chief executive of Meals on Wheels
South Texas, which serves roughly 300 people a week, including Ms. Gentis. His
group also receives private donations, with federal funds accounting for some 40
percent of the budget, he said.
The federal community unit under the ax also plays a key role in supporting
disabled Americans, including older individuals.
“So much of the work we do is about giving people dignity in their lives,” said
Karen Tamley, the chief executive of Access Living, a Chicago-based center, one of
400 across the United States.
The centers connect people with a variety of services, and offer job and skills
training to young adults with disabilities. They may teach someone to drive, or help
them find affordable housing.
The Administration for Community Living has helped organizations navigate the
state and local bureaucracies responsible for doling out federal funds. When Mr.
Capone wanted more clarity as to how Texas was distributing the money, he got in
touch with the unit’s regional office in Dallas. “We just started building that
relationship with the field office, and that field office is gone,” he said.
“It is frustrating on a practical level,” said Fay Gordon, one of the regional
administrators who was let go earlier this month. “These programs are live and
need direction.”

Some groups are not waiting before starting to take steps to reduce costs. Brittany
Boyd-Chisholm, the chief executive of the Center for Independent Living of Central
Pennsylvania, said that more than half of her funding comes through the federal
agency. She has asked all the managers, herself included, to take a cut in salary of
between 5 and 10 percent and is weighing other actions. She said her center was
already underfunded.
No one has provided her with any information about future grants, and her emails
have not been returned. “It makes you feel completely on your own,” Ms. Boyd-
Chisholm said.
Created under the Obama administration, the agency was intended to unify the
work of three other agencies: the Administration on Aging, the Office on Disability
and the Administration on Developmental Disabilities.
“These programs being together and working together was about efficiency and
was about coordination,” said Alison Barkoff, the former acting administrator
under President Biden, who stepped down last fall.
During the first Trump administration, at the height of the pandemic, the agency
worked with the department’s Office for Civil Rights to ensure hospitals and
doctors had clear guidelines so that if staffing fell short they wouldn’t deny care to
those with disabilities.
“We had found common ground and issues to work on together,” said Daniel Davis,
who worked for the agency’s Center of Policy and Evaluation, whose entire staff
was laid off, according to former employees.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/health/meals-on-wheels-disabilities-aging-trump-cutbacks.html
Sapna Maheshwari,NYT,1,Business,4/27/2025,Inside The Mad Dash to Turn Division I Athletes Into Influencers,"A new effort at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is aimed at turning
its student-athletes into well-remunerated social media stars. Other schools are
following suit.

Sapna Maheshwari, a U.N.C. alumna, interviewed more than a dozen student-athletes and coaches in Chapel Hill,
N.C., for this article.
Published April 27, 2025
Updated April 28, 2025
On a February afternoon at the University of North Carolina, a group of seven
students on the diving team sat barefoot on the floor of the college’s muggy
natatorium. They were staring expectantly at a petite blond woman in a black
sweater perched on a concrete block.
Vickie Segar was there, with the blessing of the university’s athletic department, to
pitch them on turning their TikTok and Instagram accounts into cash cows.
“Let’s talk about the money in the creator economy,” said Ms. Segar, after
explaining that she was a graduate of the university who had run a top influencer
marketing agency for a dozen years. “Does anybody follow Alix Earle?”
The students said yes, amid several chuckles, because asking a college student
that question in 2025 is like asking if a millennial has ever heard of Beyoncé.
How much money, she continued, did they think that Ms. Earle, a TikTok megastar
who rose to fame with confessional-style videos about beauty and college life,
makes for promoting a brand across several posts on Instagram Stories?
“$100,000?” one student guessed. “$70,000,” another tossed out.
They’re on the Varsity
Influencer Team
Ms. Segar, whose firm has worked with Ms. Earle on brand deals, paused. She
drew out her response: “$450,000 per Instagram Story.”
For a moment, there was just the hum of the pool and a single exclamation from
one student: “Oh. My. God.”
Ms. Segar smiled and explained, “Our job is to help you guys bring in some of that
money.”
Benjamin Gildin and Vickie Segar, who run Article 41.
U.N.C. doesn’t have a formal contract with Ms. Segar or her firm, Article 41. But the
school has encouraged students and coaches to work with them. Later this year,
the firm’s pitch will also be a part of orientation for freshman athletes at the school.
Welcome to the budding business of turning college athletes into social media
stars. The world of intercollegiate sports has been upended in recent years by the
National Collegiate Athletic Association’s rules that allow student-athletes to make
money from their name, image and likeness — known as N.I.L. For the most part, it
was viewed as a change that would reward stars in college basketball and football.
Now, Chapel Hill is at the forefront of the next stage of the N.I.L. era. The school is
supporting Ms. Segar in her effort, which began last fall, to turn all 850 of its
student-athletes into influencers.
The school doesn’t get a cut of their earnings. But “they want every athlete at the
school to make as much money as possible because it will get better athletes,” Ms.
Segar said.
This hoped-for, large-scale conversion of college athletes to influencers shows how
N.I.L. deals “have grown exponentially in ways that nobody could have imagined
or predicted,” said Michael H. LeRoy, a law professor at the University of Illinois.
“This is another milestone in how this is evolving.”
And while many students are eager to make some extra cash, the efforts are
alarming to some. “This saddens me,” Mr. LeRoy said. “Their bodies are being
monetized on TikTok for the benefit of the school.”
A Gold Rush
The new N.I.L. rules have already minted a few unexpected stars in the last few
years. There’s Olivia Dunne, the 22-year-old Louisiana State gymnast, who can
now command hundreds of thousands of dollars for an advertorial TikTok post. And
Haley and Hanna Cavinder, 24-year-old twins, who made N.I.L. deals valued at
more than $1.5 million, according to Forbes, while playing basketball at the
University of Miami.
Ms. Segar, 42, who graduated from North Carolina in 2005 and lives in Chapel Hill,
believes those players are just the start. Uber, Athleta and State Farm are among
companies that have already paid for posts that feature student-athletes showing
off their game-day looks or routines. Only a few students will hit big numbers, but
Ms. Segar reasons that many could eventually make at least a few thousand dollars
per branded TikTok or Instagram post.
Article 41, which Ms. Segar founded in 2024 with her husband, Ben Gildin, a lawyer
and former lacrosse player at Kenyon College, will take a 20 percent cut of the
deals, which is typical among influencer management firms.
Skyler Smith, a U.N.C. swimmer, recording a video for her social media, sponsored by Uber Eats.
Other companies, including traditional Hollywood agencies and boutique firms,
have been pouncing on N.I.L. influencer opportunities, too. Those efforts have
largely been focused on top talent in basketball and football who might one day
play professionally. Creative Artists Agency, one of Hollywood’s powerhouse firms,
says it has worked with nearly 100 athletes on N.I.L. deals since 2021.
ESM, a sports management firm that historically worked with N.F.L. players, now
represents a roster of current and former student-athletes, including the Cavinder
twins, and is helping Clemson start an in-house agency.
But Ms. Segar’s firm is unique, so far, in its belief that every athlete —
benchwarmer or not — can have a following.
‘The Lion’s Share of the Money’
Bella Miller, who competes in gymnastics for the school, has struck a paid deal with Athleta.
Bubba Cunningham, the U.N.C. athletic director, works out of an office next door to
the Dean E. Smith Center, where its famed men’s basketball team plays. From
there, he oversees 28 varsity teams, many of them elite, like women’s soccer and
field hockey.
Mr. Cunningham, whose given name is Lawrence, has been the college’s athletic
director for more than a decade, which means he has watched the full-scale erosion
of the long-held bargain between athletes and their universities: a free education in
exchange for their on-field prowess. That meant, officially at least, no
advertisements, gifts or cuts of merchandise sold by schools, even jerseys with
their name on the back.
That model has all but imploded in recent years amid a series of antitrust cases.
Based on the preliminary terms of a landmark settlement, schools like U.N.C. will
offer student-athletes two potential forms of compensation beyond scholarships in
the 2025-26 school year. The school is likely to have $20.5 million — calculated by
taking 22 percent of the most recent annual revenue from four major college sports
divisions generated from media and sponsorship rights and ticket sales — to pay
athletes directly, through a revenue-sharing agreement. The settlement would
resolve several antitrust lawsuits filed against the N.C.A.A. and the biggest
conferences by former college athletes.
At U.N.C., that $20.5 million will go to men’s and women’s basketball, football and
baseball, according to Mr. Cunningham. Many other schools are doing similar
splits.
“Since this is about the commercial value of the sport, we’re going to attribute the
money to the sport that earned it,” he said.
Making an arrangement with a firm like Ms. Segar’s offers him a solution for
everyone else — especially female athletes.
“The most popular player on the most popular team is what I’ve always said will
get the lion’s share of the money,” Mr. Cunningham said. “But the most
entrepreneurial student that understands social media and understands how to
create a social media presence can become an influencer.”
Ms. Miller, who has more than 27,000 followers on TikTok, said that she wasn’t sure sports like hers
would ever benefit from N.I.L.
Bella Miller, a 22-year-old gymnast at U.N.C. with more than 27,000 followers on
TikTok, said she wasn’t sure sports like hers would ever benefit from N.I.L., with so
few athletes eventually competing professionally. Despite the success of someone
like Ms. Dunne, most brands and agents “don’t want to focus their time and energy
on sports like gymnastics, volleyball, swimming because they didn’t really see that
potential,” she added.
The ‘Cringe-y’ Hump
Article 41’s pitch about becoming an influencer — complete with a 50-page training
guide with tips like “no, you don’t have to dance” and “treat each TikTok as a bite-
sized lesson” — is aimed at members of a cohort who have, in some cases, been
using social media since before they were teenagers.
For many, the notion of becoming a creator is appealing. In a 2023 Morning Consult
survey, three in five members of Generation Z said they would become influencers
if given the opportunity. (And many of them might have the opportunity. There are
27 million paid creators in the United States, and 44 percent of them are doing it full
time, according to a 2023 survey from the Keller Advisory Group, a consultancy.)
Alyssa Ustby, a star player on the women’s basketball team, is among U.N.C.’s highest-paid student-
athletes when it comes to N.I.L. deals.
Alyssa Ustby, 23, a star player on the women’s basketball team, who is
bespectacled and earnest off the court, is among the highest-paid U.N.C. student-
athletes when it comes to N.I.L. deals.
She said she had around 1,000 Instagram followers before college: She’d post
photos of friends, or senior prom. But when she entered U.N.C. in 2020, TikTok was
ubiquitous.
“I was like, ‘OK, what’s the worst that could happen — that I stay where I am?’”
Ms. Ustby said. She quickly became a hit with a TikTok series that showed her
training with other U.N.C. athletes, poking fun at her form as she tried to do laps
with the swim team and trying to catch a ball with the women’s lacrosse team.
Now, she has 132,000 followers on TikTok and 54,000 on Instagram and commands
between $10,000 and $15,000 for branded posts. Sponsors have included Papa
John’s (“Where’s the best place to eat an epic stuffed crust pizza?” she asks, eating
one as a study snack and in the gym in a TikTok ad) and American Eagle Outfitters.
Ms. Ustby, who majored in advertising and public relations (and just signed a free-
agent contract with the W.N.B.A.’s Los Angeles Sparks), said she saw her
experience building a TikTok audience as akin to an internship. She earned more
than $100,000 through brand deals last year and tracked them on a spreadsheet
that is also monitored by her father, a wealth manager.
Jake Dailey, a wrestler, has no reservations about featuring his body prominently on his social media. He
has scored free products and a recent paid deal with an apparel company called the Mutt Dog.
Jake Dailey, a 19-year-old freshman wrestler from Scranton, Pa., with moppy hair
and a big smile, said that he was probably 10 years old when he started using social
media. He started posting silly jokes and wrestling videos to TikTok as a high
school freshman in 2021, which his mother encouraged, even though it earned
some derision from his peers.
“I would say, yeah, it’s cringe-y,” but “it’s definitely going to pay off in the long run
for me,” he said. Mr. Dailey said he had scored free products and a recent paid deal
with an apparel company called the Mutt Dog.
Many of Mr. Dailey’s posts depict him shirtless, pointing his phone camera at
himself in the mirror or flexing. In his view, physique is part of why student-
athletes play well on social media. “Young, fit, attractive people definitely come
from athletics,” he said.
Mr. Dailey, who has 90,000 TikTok followers and 32,000 on Instagram, said he
would be thrilled to become a full-time influencer. Otherwise, he plans to become a
dentist.
The Thirst Trap Strategy
Bodies are, inevitably, part of what’s on display. When Ms. Segar and Mr. Gildin
spoke to U.N.C.’s divers, they urged them to highlight their physical abilities. “I put
diving at the top with gymnastics” with tricks that regular people can’t do, Ms.
Segar told the group, using an expletive for emphasis. (She said she intentionally
peppers her talks with curse words to put the students at ease.)
Women are often the audience that brands are trying to reach on TikTok and
Instagram, and they’re more likely to post as creators on the platforms, Ms. Segar
said. The success of athletes like Ms. Dunne and the Cavinder twins sometimes
attracts a line of criticism about how much their looks matter.
Mr. Dailey, whose posts depict him shirtless, hopes to become a dentist if influencing eludes him as a
career.
Ms. Segar admitted that athlete-influencers in the very top tier are more likely to
be conventionally attractive, but pushed back on the idea that the student-athletes
she is pitching need to adopt what she called Mr. Dailey’s “thirst trap strategy.”
A breakout star probably has “something really special about them — they are
either a top athlete or they are really beautiful or they are incredibly funny,” she
said. “But we don’t need people to get eight million followers. We need them to get
to 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 followers — that is where we start seeing revenue.”
Ms. Segar acknowledged that race can play a role in determining which athletes
gain bigger social media followings, outside of sports like basketball and football.
But she said she believed that was changing with the younger generation. And, she
added, “there is more money going to diverse creators in the N.I.L. space than
there is in the traditional influencer space that I’ve worked in for over a decade.”
Mr. LeRoy, the Illinois law professor, said he was concerned about the mental
health ramifications as more athletes pushed to have big presences on social
media.
Ms. Ustby an advertising and public relations major, said she sees her experience building a TikTok
audience as akin to an internship.
Ms. Ustby, the basketball player, said a friend on the team who started building up
her TikTok presence at the same time as her didn’t enjoy the same success.
“She was constantly putting in all this effort, making videos, and they would just
never go viral,” she said. “She said it literally just felt like a popularity contest she
was losing, and it sucks, and that was a really strenuous thing on our friendship
because my stuff was kind of taking off.”
Mr. LeRoy said that it was worth remembering that “these are undergrads, many
of whom are teenagers.”
“If part of your N.I.L. strategy as a school is to increase your student-athlete
exposure to the social media ecosystem that is filled with irrationality and hate,
you’re not helping the mental health of the athletes,” Mr. LeRoy said. “This is not a
good atmosphere for them to be competing at a high level and then also competing
in the social media sphere.”
Mark Gangloff, U.N.C.’s head coach of swimming and diving, said he was keeping
an eye on how influencing fit into athletes’ “very full plates.”
“That is my only caution — how much is too many things for any one person to try
and take on at one time?” he said.
(Article 41 and U.N.C.’s coaches have emphasized that the effort is entirely
voluntary and that many student-athletes have opted to keep their social media
profiles private.)
Top of the Algorithm
Ryleigh Heck, a U.N.C. field hockey player, recording a video for Athleta. She has been watching TikTok
since it was known as Musical.ly pre-2018, and counts the Cavinder twins, the basketball players, among
her favorite influencers.
Ms. Segar and Mr. Gildin are self-funding Article 41, which has 13 full-time
employees and 24 paid interns. (She sold her influencer agency, Village Marketing,
to the ad giant WPP in 2022.) The couple are prepared to invest several million
dollars into the firm, which they say has helped launch social profiles for more than
70 students and coaches who have signed agreements with the firm.
Article 41 is fielding requests for similar work from other colleges like the
University of Michigan. It plans to seek compensation for its services from other
institutions, though it is not asking for money from U.N.C., where Ms. Segar and
Mr. Gildin are donors and Ms. Segar sits on a board for its athletic booster club.
The firm is intervening when brands send free products to athletes and insisting
that they are paid for posting about them. It’s also trying to sweeten existing
equipment deals between brands and teams by adding promises of social media
posts to their deals to help teams earn revenue.
Athleta is among the brands that have already struck paid deals with Ryleigh
Heck, a field hockey player, and Ms. Miller, the gymnast, but it does not officially
outfit U.N.C. athletes otherwise. Michelle Goad, Athleta’s chief digital officer, said it
was testing ads with the students in part to help “build a bridge to our next
generation of consumers,” and to see if the exposure could eventually exceed that
of traditional college sponsorships.
Asked if she’d thought about becoming a creator herself, Ms. Heck quickly responded, “I totally thought
about it and I’m so into it.”
Anna Frey, a 17-year-old tennis star from Farmington, Utah, will be one of the
biggest athlete-influencers on campus when she starts her freshman year at U.N.C.
this fall, with 2.1 million TikTok followers who watch posts of her serving tennis
balls, performing dances to popular TikTok sounds and going to school dances.
(She is also represented by ESM.)
Her father, Tanner Frey, said there were some serious cons to that sort of presence.
“I feel like 90 percent of people are so nice in the comments and 5 percent are mean
and 5 percent are perverts,” he said in an interview.
Mr. Frey said he had made a block list of “about probably 30 words” that Instagram
and TikTok could use to censor offensive comments on his daughter’s posts. He
said the “meanest, nastiest” comments came from gamblers who would berate his
daughter in the comments if she lost a match.
Still, he said it was “the best time ever in the history of the world to be a female
athlete,” in part because of the opportunities tied to brand deals and the new
N.C.A.A. rules for payments.
“Four years ago, none of this was even possible,” he said. “If Anna wanted to go
play college tennis, she’d have to make a really hard decision between that and
accepting half a million dollars a year from these brands and going pro.”
He added, “It’s nice they can go and do both now.”

Melissa Eddy,NYT,1,Business,4/24/2025,Trump’s Tariffs Expected to Grind Germany’s Growth to a Halt,"Germany’s economy will not grow for the third year in a row, the government said
on Thursday, scaling back a previous prediction as President Trump’s tariffs bite
into Europe’s largest economy, leaving it stagnant.
In January, the German government had predicted 0.3 percent economic growth,
but Mr. Trump’s tariffs of 25 percent on imported automobiles, steel and aluminum
threaten to hit Germany’s export-oriented economy hard, as could the turbulence
in the markets caused by the yo-yo nature of how the tariffs have been imposed.
“The German economy, which is already suffering from weak foreign demand and
reduced competitiveness, is particularly affected by the U.S. trade policy,” Robert
Habeck, Germany’s economy minister, told reporters in Berlin on Thursday.

Germany is the only member of the Group of 7 nations whose economy has failed
to grow in the past two years.
A new German government will take power after the expected next chancellor,
Friedrich Merz, is sworn in on May 6. He has promised to spur growth, aided by
looser borrowing limits that will allow the government to spend hundreds of
billions of euros on defense and infrastructure.
But many of the problems plaguing Germany are homegrown, and economists
warn that unless the country tackles some of the underlying structural problems —
including a burdensome bureaucracy, one of Europe’s highest corporate tax rates
and soaring energy prices — even the extended borrowing will not bring relief.
“It is still unclear whether and which reforms the next federal government will
implement,” Mr. Habeck said. “The structural problems must be tackled quickly
and consistently. This will determine whether the German economy receives a
boost to its competitiveness or whether all of the money goes up in smoke.”
Germany is also facing a demographic problem, leading to a shrinking work force
and a drop in productivity. At the same time, the country is grappling with a
surging anti-immigrant sentiment, which is making it difficult for companies to
attract the skilled foreign workers they need to remain competitive.
Many companies have scaled back their growth outlook as they digest the 10
percent blanket tariff on goods exported to the United States and await the
outcome of a 90-day pause on higher levies.
The trade war is expected to be a drag on the economy next year as well. The
government now predicts growth of 1 percent for 2026.
“If the new German government does not take decisive and swift
countermeasures, we could even face a significant third consecutive year of
recession,” said Helena Melnikov, managing director of the German Chamber of
Commerce and Industry.
“It is therefore all the more important that the future German government shifts
into forward gear and finds solutions to the customs dispute with the U.S.A.,
especially at the E.U. level,” Ms. Melnikov said.
This week, the International Monetary Fund also predicted that Germany’s
economy would not grow this year, cutting its forecast to 0 percent from 0.2 percent
in January. It noted that stronger consumption driven by rising wages and the
willingness of the next government in Berlin to take on more debt could have a
positive effect on growth.
Growth across the wider eurozone, which includes Germany and 26 other E.U.
members, was also scaled down to 0.8 percent from 1 percent, the I.M.F. said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/business/german-economy-trump-tariffs.html
Meaghan Tobin,NYT,1,Business,4/25/2025,China Is Weighing Tariff Exemptions on Some U.S. Imports,"The Chinese government is considering whether to exclude some essential
products from its retaliatory 125 percent tariffs on American goods, said the head of
an American business group in China.
Officials from China’s commerce ministry canvassed businesses in China to
identify imports from the United States that are crucial to supply chains and
vulnerable to China’s new trade barriers, Michael Hart, president of the American
Chamber of Commerce in China, said at an event in Beijing on Friday.
“There are some companies who have said that if a long-term tariff war continued,
their business model would not work in China and we would see them exit,” Mr.
Hart said. “We shared that with the Chinese government because they are of
course trying to foster foreign direct investment.”
Lifesaving drugs and other health care products were one of the clearest sectors of
concern, Mr. Hart said.

Markets in Asia and Europe rose on Friday as investors looked for signs that the
trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies were starting to ease.

The trade tensions pose a major challenge for China’s economic growth, which has
been powered by exports. President Trump ratcheted up tariffs this month to 145
percent for more than half of China’s exports to the United States.
Some factories in southern China have already suspended operations since the
beginning of this month, raising concerns about whether unemployment could
increase in China.
Chinese officials have responded by not only imposing extraordinary tariffs on U.S.
imports but encouraging consumers to buy products made in China.
But there are some goods that China does not make. China depends on foreign
companies for advanced computer chips, and many in the country’s tech industry
have hoped semiconductors will escape the tariffs.
There have also been indications that China may be relenting on tariffs on
semiconductors made in the United States. A state-backed trade association in
China said this month that a significant portion of advanced chips would be exempt

from China’s tariffs if they were made outside the United States even if they were
sold to China by an American company.
Many advanced chips are designed by American companies like Nvidia, Qualcomm
and AMD but manufactured in Taiwan. The guidance said that for the purposes of
tariffs, China would not consider such chips as originating in the United States.
Reports have circulated in Chinese media outlets and on Chinese social media this
week that Beijing had decided not to put tariffs on some semiconductor-related
products made in the United States. The Chinese government has not announced
such a policy.
On Thursday, a logistics and warehousing company in Shenzhen said on social
media that it had been notified that eight types of chip-related products originating
in the United States would be exempt from additional tariffs. A representative from
the company, when reached by phone on Friday, could not confirm the reports.
Caijing, a Chinese business magazine, published a report on the exemptions on
Friday morning. The report was removed within hours.
Guo Jiakun, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said he was not familiar
with the situation when he was asked on Friday at a news briefing whether China
was considering rolling back some tariffs on U.S. products.
“Right now we are in a situation of unintended consequences,” Mr. Hart said. “The
United States and China are both doing the same exercise where they are starting
to understand that there may have been some unintended consequences to
businesses and supply chains from the tariffs, and I think that’s why we are seeing
both of them look at making exceptions.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/business/china-considering-tariff-exemptions.html
Ana Swanson,NYT,1,Business,4/28/2025,"Howard Lutnick, Trump’s ‘Buoyant’ Trade Warrior, Flexes His Power Over Global Business","Since Howard Lutnick was tapped to serve as President Trump’s commerce
secretary, executives from some of the world’s largest companies have been trying
to win him over.
Leaders of Nvidia, Facebook, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and
Alphabet have visited his newly purchased $25 million property in Washington — a
16,250-square-foot mansion that Mr. Lutnick, a billionaire, recently quipped would
be “big enough for my ego” — to persuade him to adopt a business-friendly agenda.
As Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs to levels not seen in a century, Ford Motor,
General Motors and other companies that have built their businesses around
international trade reached out to Mr. Lutnick in the hope that he could persuade
the president to take a less aggressive approach. Some chief executives have put in
calls to the commerce secretary at midnight.
Mr. Lutnick, 63, heads a department that both promotes and regulates industry,
and he has been put in charge of overseeing trade. As a result, he has found himself
in a position of incredible influence, as the go-between for a president imposing
sweeping tariffs and the industries being crushed by them.
A former bond trader who amassed billions on Wall Street, Mr. Lutnick has become
one of the loudest salesmen for tariffs in an administration generally unified on
their benefits. He has publicly echoed the president’s message that big tariffs are
needed to revive American industry, and that if companies don’t like them, they
should build factories in the United States.
Howard Lutnick, the secretary of commerce, has become a go-to for major companies
seeking relief from tariffs. But he’s not always friendly to their interests.
But in internal conversations in the administration, he has often been a voice for
moderation. He argued in favor of Mr. Trump’s pausing his global tariffs for 90 days
after they sent convulsions through the stock and bond markets. And he has made
the case to the president to grant relief to certain favored industries, helping them
to win exemptions from billions of dollars of levies.
After the country’s biggest car companies argued to Mr. Lutnick that tariffs on
Canada and Mexico would hurt the competitiveness of U.S. auto factories, Mr.
Lutnick lobbied the president to secure a major exemption in March.
In April, Mr. Lutnick helped to push through exceptions that saved electronics
companies from severe China tariffs, after he and other officials received calls from
executives like Tim Cook of Apple and Michael Dell of Dell Technologies.
Mr. Trump appears to regret granting such exclusions. He has groused to
associates that he did not want to do them in the first place, and wrote on Truth
Social in April that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” saying electronics would be
subject to other tariffs in the future.
Companies have been left deeply confused about the direction of trade policy but
more determined than ever to lobby for lucrative exemptions.

Mr. Lutnick did not respond to a request for an interview. A spokesman for the
Commerce Department declined to comment. The New York Times spoke with
more than three dozen corporate executives and current and former employees of
the Commerce Department, the White House and Mr. Lutnick’s former Wall Street
firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, and others.
Mr. Lutnick is not always on the side of helping industry. Often he has employed
the threat of tariffs or other aggressive tactics against businesses to encourage
them to invest more in the United States.
For example, Mr. Lutnick has paused disbursements to companies from the CHIPS
program, a bipartisan, multibillion-dollar effort to rebuild America’s semiconductor
industry. Mr. Lutnick put pressure on some executives to increase their U.S.
investments if they want to receive their funds, even though companies have
already signed contracts for those payments, according to three people familiar
with the conversations.
He has also given companies the impression that they may get tariff relief by
investing more in the United States, and discussed holding tariffs paid by
companies in escrow, returning the money if they make U.S. investments.
Companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia have announced investments since
Mr. Trump began threatening tariffs.
As a former investment banker, Mr. Lutnick seems particularly interested in novel
ways to shore up government finances. He has backed Mr. Trump’s plan of selling
citizenship to wealthy foreigners with a “gold card,” and talked about the
government’s taking a cut from patents and innovations.

interested in novel ways to shore up government finances. Theo Wargo/Getty Images
Mr. Lutnick has floated renaming the Department of the Interior “the Department
of American Assets” and using tariff revenue to finance a new sovereign wealth
fund. He has also spoken passionately about establishing a new “investment
accelerator” that aims to cut red tape for investors.
Mr. Lutnick’s supporters say he brings fresh thinking that is badly needed in
Washington. But executives and foreign officials have described some of his
proposals as zany or harmful, and come away from conversations deeply unsettled,
half a dozen people familiar with the exchanges say.
And despite overseeing a sprawling government agency, Mr. Lutnick is working to
further expand his reach.
He has been moving to take control of the customs service in order to make Mr.
Trump’s “External Revenue Service” — which would collect import taxes — a
reality. Mr. Lutnick has also expressed interest in gaining authority over the U.S.
Postal Service. After Mr. Trump gave him “a whole 24 hours,” in Mr. Lutnick’s
words, to figure out how to fix the post office’s finances, Mr. Lutnick suggested
merging it into the Commerce Department and using mail carriers to do the
national census.
As a go-to adviser for the president, Mr. Lutnick has helped fan Mr. Trump’s
impulses and instincts. After Mr. Trump expressed concerns that the United States
was losing influence over the Panama Canal, Mr. Lutnick had a friend set up two
iPhones to record video of ship traffic through the canal, he told an audience at a
conference in Washington in March. Mr. Lutnick shared the videos with Mr. Trump,
and they lamented how much Chinese writing was on the side of the boats and
shipping containers. “The Panamanians had sold out,” he said.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct
financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Few of the ideas that Mr. Lutnick appears most enthusiastic about fall within the
traditional purview of the Commerce Department, an agency with roughly 50,000
employees that oversees business, weather monitoring, fisheries, artificial
intelligence and commercial space activity.
Within the department, employees say morale has plummeted, as the
administration has piled on work and slashed hundreds of jobs. Technologists and
scientists who have devoted their careers to making the United States more
globally competitive — one of the Trump administration’s stated goals — say they
have been left rudderless.
Some Commerce employees said that Mr. Lutnick, unlike past secretaries, did not
send a welcome email or give a welcome address, and that they did not know his
email or see him in person for a month after his confirmation. Mr. Lutnick has told
others that he planned to spend most of his time at the White House.
Many employees believe Mr. Lutnick is focused on an audience of one: the man he
refers to as “DJT.” Mr. Lutnick often speaks of the president’s intuition, wisdom and
prescience; has boasted of having regular Friday night dinners with Mr. Trump;
and describes any day that he speaks to the president as a “good day.”
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of health and human services, said Mr. Lutnick
had a “unique chemistry” with the president and “an instinct for finding hidden
levers of power to implement policy.” He described Mr. Lutnick as “garrulous,
funny and irrepressibly buoyant.”
“I think if you cut his head off, he’d still be smiling,” Mr. Kennedy said.
Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, described Mr. Lutnick as
“relentless” and said they were “very close partners” in developing and executing
trade policy. “The country is extremely fortunate to have him in public service,” he
said.
At a dinner in the Australian Embassy in February where he gave the keynote
speech, Mr. Lutnick said he had first brushed with Mr. Trump decades ago at New
York charity dinners, after which they would go out and “chase the same girls.” The
line was met with awkward silence, a person in attendance said.
Mr. Lutnick told the group of foreign dignitaries and investors that the U.S.
economy was greatest at the turn of the 20th century, when it had high tariffs on
foreign products. He said Mr. Trump planned to construct “a tariff wall” around the
United States and urged foreign countries to be on the right side of it.
Some foreign governments that have negotiated with Mr. Lutnick have described
him as brash and aggressive. Canadian officials say he issued a series of
devastating threats in a February phone call, warning that Mr. Trump could eject
Canada from the intelligence-sharing group the Five Eyes and review the defense
system that shields both countries from foreign missiles.
Mexican officials, in contrast, described Mr. Lutnick as tough but engaging, and
said he was receptive to their arguments that automotive supply chains that run
between the countries can be beneficial for U.S. factories.
“With us, he was constructive,” said Luis Rosendo Gutiérrez Romano, the Mexican
deputy secretary for trade.
Mr. Lutnick seems to be relishing his role in Mr. Trump’s orbit. He threw himself a
lavish confirmation party in February at his Washington home. Mr. Lutnick and his
wife, Allison, mingled with senators, Wall Street traders and executives like Meta’s
Mark Zuckerberg.
Many Commerce Department employees believe that Mr. Lutnick is focused on an

He has also embraced the media spotlight. Some of his near-daily TV appearances
have set off alarm among Trump officials and allies, as well as charges from
Democrats that Mr. Trump’s billionaire cabinet is out of touch.
In late March, Mr. Lutnick said in an interview that only a “fraudster” would
complain about missing a Social Security check, and that his 94-year-old mother-in-
law “wouldn’t call and complain.”
In April, Mr. Lutnick said in a TV interview that “the army of millions and millions
of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones — that kind of
thing is going to come to America.”
While new to Washington, Mr. Lutnick served for more than 30 years as the chief
executive of Cantor Fitzgerald, the New York brokerage firm, and carved out a
substantial fortune in a brutally competitive industry. He also led BGC Group, a
broker dealer, and was a top executive at Newmark, a commercial property firm.
Mr. Lutnick’s life was tinged with tragedy that made him more protective over
friends and family and encouraged him to build an empire of wealth around them.
He lost both his parents suddenly as a young man. And Cantor Fitzgerald lost
hundreds of employees, including Mr. Lutnick’s brother and best friend, during the
Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center, where its offices were.
Some former employees said Mr. Lutnick had treated them like family, taking them
to Six Flags and the circus and buying them popcorn and cotton candy. Others
recalled that Mr. Lutnick would leave the office to eat dinner with his family, then
come back for meetings at 10 p.m., which he expected employees to attend.
Jimmy Dunne, the vice chairman of Piper Sandler, an investment bank that has
worked with Cantor, described Mr. Lutnick as “very intense and very tough.”
“You go to battle with him or against him, you better be pretty secure because he’s
going to test you,” Mr. Dunne said. “He doesn’t shy away from a fight.”
Mr. Lutnick described himself as a fiscal conservative and social liberal, and he has
a history of supporting both Republicans and Democrats. But his strong support
for Israel and conservative economics helped sway him toward Mr. Trump.
Employees who had known Mr. Lutnick for a long time were surprised in 2020 to
hear him question the results of the presidential election. In 2024, Mr. Lutnick was
a major donor to Mr. Trump and then co-chair of his transition team. Mr. Lutnick
vied to become Treasury secretary, but lost out to the hedge fund manager Scott
Bessent. The hostility between the two men has not abated, despite their working
together to persuade Mr. Trump to pause some of his tariffs.

Jack Ewing,NYT,1,Business,4/27/2025,Tesla and Volkswagen May Have a Leg Up As Tariffs Raise EV Prices,"President Trump’s tariffs on imported cars and auto parts could stall the growth of
electric vehicles, setting back a technology critical to addressing climate change.
But the tariffs could also work in favor of some electric models made in the United
States, like the Tesla Model Y or Volkswagen ID.4, that are among the cars with the
fewest imported parts and, thus, the least vulnerable to tariffs.
The tariffs could lead to steep increases in the cost of batteries and other
components. By hurting electric vehicle manufacturing in the United States, the
tariffs could also cede more ground to Chinese automakers that have a substantial
lead.
One thing is clear: The tariffs will raise prices for all vehicles — gasoline, electric
or hybrid — and could lead to severe parts shortages if some suppliers go out of
business. There will be ripple effects that no one can predict. But vehicles that are
subjected to lower tariffs could gain a competitive advantage.

E.V. supply chains may be easier to overhaul
Electric vehicles have far fewer parts than cars that run on gasoline or diesel. In
theory, it should be easier for carmakers to source parts from the United States,
avoiding tariffs.
Efforts to create a domestic supply chain for electric vehicles are well underway, in
part because of Biden administration policies that provided loans and subsidies to
battery factories and other projects.
LG Energy Solution, a South Korean battery maker, runs three battery factories in
the United States that supply General Motors and other customers. Three more LG
plants will begin producing batteries next year, and a seventh is planned.

The problem is that many battery raw materials come from China and may face
stiff tariffs. For example, China dominates the supply of refined graphite, an
essential ingredient in most electric vehicle batteries.
American companies are working on producing battery-grade graphite, lithium
and other key materials. But it will be several years before these operations can
replace Chinese suppliers.
Some E.V.s are already the most American-made
Workers assembling an electric drivetrain at a General Motors plant in Spring Hill,

All the cars that Tesla sells in the United States are made in California or Texas.
Last year, Tesla’s Model Y sport utility vehicle topped Cars.com’s annual American-
made index, which uses data that automakers submit to the federal government
and other sources to rank vehicles according to how much of their content and
labor originates in the United States.
Tesla uses some parts from Mexico and China that will be subject to tariffs, but less
so than other automakers. That gives the Model Y, Tesla’s most popular vehicle, a
cost advantage that could narrow the price gap with conventional cars. On
average, sale prices for electric vehicles are $12,000 more than comparable
vehicles with internal combustion engines, according to Cox Automotive.
“We do have localized supply chains in both America, Europe and China,” Elon
Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, said last week on a conference call with analysts
and investors. “So that puts us in a stronger position than our competitors.”
Another vehicle relatively insulated from tariffs is the Volkswagen ID.4, an electric
sport utility vehicle made in Tennessee with a battery from Georgia.
“That’s not a bad thought,” Kjell Gruner, the president of Volkswagen Group of
America, said last week when a reporter asked whether the ID.4 might gain a
competitive advantage.
But he added that figuring out the ultimate impact of tariffs was extremely difficult
because many variables were at play and because Mr. Trump’s trade policies
changed frequently. Mr. Gruner said he started each day with a meeting with other
executives to discuss the latest developments.
“You need to look at your entire value chain, from logistics to manufacturing,
procurement, sales and marketing,” Mr. Gruner said. “You need to get into the
weeds.”
Mr. Musk has warned that tariffs will also be bad for Tesla and said he had failed to
talk the president out of them.
Automakers may favor more profitable gasoline vehicles
Except for Tesla, most carmakers don’t make much or any money on electric
vehicles. Carmakers may decide to curtail production of those cars and focus on
gasoline pickups and sport utility vehicles that usually are very profitable.
The risk is that, by delaying rollouts of electric vehicles, U.S. carmakers will lose
their ability to compete with Chinese, South Korean and European carmakers that
are expanding their electric lineups. There is near unanimity in the industry that
sooner or later electric vehicles will become more popular than cars with internal
combustion engines.
“It’s hard to figure out how you net out the massive costs potentially associated
with tariffs with the need to continue to invest in the future,” said John Bozzella,
president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry association.
Some tariffs will fall harder on E.V.s
Electric vehicles usually have more semiconductors than cars with internal
combustion engines and would be hit harder by tariffs on chips that Mr. Trump has
signaled may be coming.
Some tariffs may also apply to charging equipment, which could slow the recent
rapid growth of stations where people can plug in vehicles. Fear of not being able to
find a charger has kept many people from buying electric vehicles.
The motors in most electric vehicles use magnets that contain rare earth minerals,
which will be in short supply because of restrictions that China recently imposed in
retaliation to U.S. tariffs.
The rare earths crunch will probably come in the second half of the year, said Neha
Mukherjee, lead rare earths analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.
“There are stockpiles already in the market which can suffice for now,” Ms.
Mukherjee said. If the restrictions continue, she said, “we’ll see prices ticking
higher.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/business/tariffs-tesla-volkswagen-evs.html
Jacob Gallagher,NYT,1,Business,4/24/2025,"With Underdog Brand, Jason Kelce Takes ‘Made in the U.S.’ Seriously","Jason Kelce, a mellow mountain of a man, has spent most of his life fretting over
offensive snaps.
Now, a year into his retirement after 13 seasons as a center for the Philadelphia
Eagles, Mr. Kelce has space to puzzle over other matters. Lately, he’s been thinking
about sweatshirts and T-shirts. And he has thoughts. Lots of thoughts.
“On the inside of a sweatshirt, I don’t like when it feels fuzzy,” said Mr. Kelce,
speaking on a video call from his Philadelphia home in April, just a few days after
the birth of his fourth daughter. He wants a “heavier-duty” sweatshirt, with a
smidge of stretch. Something durable, “that you can wear working or lounging
around on the couch.”
Oh, and it needs to be made entirely in the United States.
To achieve all this, Mr. Kelce, 37, has taken matters into his own hands. Today, his
Underdog apparel brand is debuting a tidy collection of crew neck sweatshirts and
T-shirts, all produced — from the cotton to the completed garment — in the United
States. These items are produced in collaboration with American Giant, a San
Francisco-based company formed in 2012 that manufactures entirely in the United
States.
The American Giant-produced Underdog pocket T-shirts and French terry
sweatshirts will sell for $45 and $79, respectively, and will be sold on the Underdog
website. They are, to Mr. Kelce’s specifications, on the burlier side. During the
interview, he wore the pocket T-shirt in green, his abundant biceps mildly squeezed
by the sleeves.
Underdog has released a pocket T-shirt and a French terry sweatshirt, both of which had design input
from Mr. Kelce. Underdog
“I don’t want to offend anybody, I never understood the reason that somebody
would want to wear Gucci, or some of these high-end brands,” said Mr. Kelce,
leaving unsaid that his brother, Travis, has been known to wear a Gucci hat or two.
“It’s never appealed to me.”
“I would much rather wear something that symbolized a blue-collar worker as
opposed to a suit,” he added, even if he does have to wriggle into a suit when he
appears as an analyst for “Monday Night Countdown” on ESPN.
That Underdog’s clothes are entirely made in the United States is the most
gratifying part to Mr. Kelce.
“I grew up going into steel mills with my father,” he said of his childhood in
Cleveland Heights, Ohio. “So, the concept of American workers making things was
something that was ingrained early. And I just always gravitated toward it.”
Mr. Kelce has long been plotting for life after his last snap. In 2022, he started the
“New Heights” podcast with his brother. It remains in the top 200 of Apple’s top
podcasts, though it now runs behind his wife Kylie’s show, “Not Gonna Lie.”
While many retired athletes pour money into car dealerships or restaurant
ventures, Mr. Kelce became curious about clothes.
“I was trying to come up with what’s a way that we can celebrate Philadelphia,”
said Mr. Kelce, who is nothing if not an unofficial ambassador for his adopted city.
“And I love wearing shirts that represent me and everything that I believe in.”
Bayard Winthrop, the chief executive of American Giant, said Mr. Kelce “had lots of small opinions” on

He started Underdog in 2022 as an apparel brand with vigorous nods to
Philadelphia. Past graphics featured his Eagles teammates, and the name alludes
to the Eagles having labeled themselves as underdogs on their way to winning the
Super Bowl in 2018. It is a unique proposition from a former athlete, and one that
has, to many outside the Eagles fandom, perhaps flown under the radar. Underdog
does not have the techy edge of say, Tom Brady’s slick, fitness-centric Brady brand.
It leans more on Mr. Kelce’s jolly, jumbo-size profile than on his on-field prowess.
The label has made prior attempts at producing in the United States, though Mr.
Kelce soon learned that even if the tag said an item had been made here, “a good
portion of that might be made overseas.” Garments that read “Made in the United
States” can be produced from cotton or other components that derive from
elsewhere.
In American Giant, Underdog found a partner that was capable of producing the
whole garment, including the fabric, here in the United States. The cotton was
harvested and finished in the Southeast, including in North Carolina. The garments
themselves were produced in Los Angeles.
“These fabrics were custom-designed for Jason,” said Bayard Winthrop, the chief
executive of American Giant who underscored that the ex-Pro-Bowler “had lots of
small opinions” about how the shirts and sweats should fit and feel.
“The shirts have a really gutsy, sturdy quality to them,” said Mr. Winthrop. “They
drape a certain way. They’re not clingy to the body. They’re not overly delicate.”
Mr. Kelce and his Philadelphia Eagles teammates labeled
themselves as underdogs ahead of the Super Bowl in 2018,
which helped inspire the brand’s name and logo. Michelle

Last year, Mr. Kelce traveled with Mr. Winthrop to North and South Carolina see
the production process firsthand, giving him a look at how clothes are made that
few people ever see, or even consider. With most apparel manufacturing having
been exported overseas, only 2 percent of the clothing Americans buy is
manufactured domestically.
“The eye-opening part for me was how truly decentralized this is, how many
people touch just one T-shirt and how many steps there are in that process,” said
Mr. Kelce. “I had never really thought much about that.”
Though this project has been in the works for around two years, it debuts at an
auspicious moment, as Americans are contemplating what they’re willing to
sacrifice — macro- and micro-economically — to bring back American
manufacturing. Hours before the interview, President Trump pulled back on steep
tariffs that had unsettled the global economic landscape, though a tit-for-tat trade
war with China has continued.
“I have no issues with global trade whatsoever,” said Mr. Kelce, who was
evenhanded about the impact of his small stab at making his goods solely in the
United States. He was, he said, not going to stop buying shirts and clothes that
were not totally made here.
“I don’t think there’s any type of statement trying to be made other than, ‘Listen,
there’s some really awesome reasons to support homegrown American businesses
and local businesses,’” he said.
For the company’s initial wave of products, Underdog used cotton harvested and finished in the

Considering Mr. Kelce’s longstanding love affair with Philadelphia, it may strike
some shoppers as odd that the Underdog line is not produced there. It was
discussed, but the reality, said Mr. Winthrop, was that Philadelphia, like many cities
that were once manufacturing hubs, was “gutted out” when it came to apparel
production.
“There is no at-scale dyeing or finishing or knitting capability in Philly,” he said. Mr.
Kelce said that in the future, the company would find ways to incorporate the city
into its brand. His partner, Stephen Porter, noted that anything Underdog screen
printed or embroidered was done locally.
The line might not be made in Philadelphia, but his green shirt proved that Mr.
Kelce knew he had to keep his fans happy.
“Philadelphia bleeds green,” he said. “If we didn’t have a green shirt, it would have
felt like malpractice.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/style/jason-kelce-underdog-made-in-

Santul Nerkar,NYT,1,Business,5/2/2025,Former Abercrombie C.E.O. Ruled Unfit to Stand Trial for Sex Trafficking,"Michael S. Jeffries, the former chief executive of Abercrombie and Fitch who was
charged with running an international sex-trafficking ring, on Friday was found
unfit to stand trial because of an Alzheimer’s diagnosis.
In a three-page order, Judge Nusrat J. Choudhury of the Eastern District of New
York, wrote that Mr. Jeffries was “suffering from a mental disease or defect
rendering him mentally incompetent.” Judge Choudhury also ordered that Mr.
Jeffries be hospitalized for four months to observe whether his condition improves.
The ruling followed a letter filed last month by Mr. Jeffries’s lawyers, Brian H.
Bieber and Alek Ubieta. They wrote that, based on the independent evaluation of
three doctors, Mr. Jeffries, 80, had severe dementia and Alzheimer’s, which
“ensures continued decline over time.” The condition meant Mr. Jeffries could not
understand the charges he was facing, his lawyers wrote.
Mr. Jeffries was indicted last October on charges that, from 2008 to 2015, he
coerced dozens of men into sex with him, using his position as the clothing
retailer’s chief executive to sexually exploit models who were motivated to
advance their careers. He had pleaded not guilty.
Working with his romantic partner, Matthew Smith, and a third person, James
Jacobson, Mr. Jeffries lured the men to secret sex parties with the possibility that
they’d receive modeling jobs, federal prosecutors said. Mr. Smith and Mr. Jacobson
have also been charged with sex trafficking, and, like Mr. Jeffries, have pleaded not
guilty.
According to prosecutors, the men that Mr. Jeffries and his co-defendants coerced
were not allowed to leave the sex parties. Along with being forced into sex, they
were made to consume alcohol, drugs and Viagra. The charges echoed claims made
in a class-action lawsuit brought against Abercrombie in 2023 and reported on in a
BBC investigation.
The defendants “used their money and influence to prey on vulnerable men for
their own sexual gratification,” Breon Peace, the former U.S. attorney for the
Eastern District, said in a statement last October.
Though Mr. Jeffries was credited with saving Abercrombie from bankruptcy in the
early 1990s, the company faced a variety of crises under his stewardship, well
before last year’s criminal indictment.
When Mr. Jeffries left the company in 2014, the company was facing backlash over
what many customers saw as its hypersexualized imagery of young models, and it
had been enduring sliding sales.
In 2004, Abercrombie agreed to pay $40 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that
accused the company of favoring white employees over Black, Hispanic and Asian
workers. In 2012, it faced an age-discrimination lawsuit that claimed that
employees on Abercrombie’s Gulfstream jet were required to respond to any of Mr.
Jeffries’s requests with “no problem.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/nyregion/abercrombie-jeffries-unfit-

Daisuke Wakabayashi;Mike Isaac,NYT,1,Business,5/3/2025,Trump’s Tariff on Cheap Chinese Imports Will Cost Big Tech Billions,"The expansion of the loophole for tariff-free shipments of goods nearly a decade
ago gave rise to Temu, Shein and other low-cost online retailers offering items
straight from Chinese factories at unfathomable discounts.
It also unleashed something else — a cascade of billions of dollars of digital
advertising that provided a windfall for Meta, Alphabet and other technology
industry giants. Temu and Shein, jockeying for the attention of American shoppers,
blanketed seemingly every inch of the internet with their ads. In the last two years,
only Amazon spent more on online advertising in the United States than Shein or
Temu.
Now, the advertising bonanza might be coming to an end after the demise of the
shipping loophole that spurred it.
On Friday, President Trump eliminated the exemption that had allowed goods
made in mainland China and Hong Kong valued at less than $800 to enter the
United States without being subject to import taxes. For Temu and Shein, this
means they are now subject to tariffs of as much as 145 percent to bring over
Chinese goods. Last week, Temu started adding “import charges” to certain
products, which more than doubled the overall price to buy and ship the items.
A Temu spokesperson said on Friday that the company had stopped shipping
products from China directly to customers in the United States, and that its U.S.
orders would now be shipped from local warehouses in America, as the business
“transitions to a local fulfillment model.” Shein did not immediately respond to an
email requesting comment.
The new tariffs are expected to deal a punishing blow to companies built on selling
goods at rock-bottom prices and attracting customers through aggressive online
advertising.

Using the slogan “Shop Like a Billionaire,” Temu bought advertising time during
the Super Bowl.
Temu’s parent company, PDD Holdings, used a similar strategy for its Chinese e-
commerce app, Pinduoduo, in China, spending lavishly on advertising to grow
rapidly in a competitive market.
Sky Canaves, a principal analyst for retail and e-commerce at the research firm
eMarketer, said the ads from Temu and Shein were once “inescapable” on search,
social media and apps. But that is changing.
“They’ve already pulled back their advertising pretty heavily,” she said.
Over a two-week period starting March 31, Temu spent 31 percent less on U.S. daily
advertising on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snap, X and YouTube than its average
daily spending on those platforms in the previous 30 days, according to estimates
from Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm. Shein’s daily advertising outlays on
its social networks in the United States were down 19 percent over the same two
weeks.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Temu and Shein, which had flooded Google in the United States with ads for the
goods they sell, started to disappear from the platform in April. On April 5, Temu
accounted for 19 percent of all U.S. ads displayed on Google Shopping, but that
figure dropped to zero a week later, according to research by Tinuiti, a marketing
firm. Shein went from around 20 percent in early April to zero by April 16.
Tinuiti identified the tariffs as the main factor behind the advertising pullback. It
said the reduction in spending coincided with the raising of prices by both
companies on certain products.
Without the constant advertising presence, Temu’s and Shein’s apps have fallen off
the charts of the 10 most downloaded mobile apps in the United States. Temu
served about 30 million daily users in the United States, the company disclosed in a
lawsuit filed against Shein in 2023.
Temu and Shein flooded the internet with ads, trailing only Amazon in U.S. online ad

At Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, some Asian retailers
had already reduced their U.S. advertising spending in anticipation of the end of
the so-called de minimis exemption, Susan Li, Meta’s chief financial officer, said on
a conference call with investors on Wednesday. Some of the spending has been
redirected to Meta platforms in other markets, but the spending in April was down
from a year earlier, she said. Ms. Li did not name any of the companies.
Investors were closely watching what Meta said because advertisers from China,
led by Temu and Shein, had been one of the company’s fastest-growing segments.
Last year, advertisers from China generated $18.4 billion in revenue for Meta,
accounting for about 11 percent of its total and more than doubling in size since
2022.
Snap, a social media firm, said that “a subset of advertisers” had cut back on
spending because of the changes to the shipping loophole. The company declined to
provide a forecast for its current quarter, citing the uncertainty caused by the
tariffs. Snap’s shares fell 12 percent after the announcement.
Last week, Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said changes to the
tariff loophole “will obviously cause a slight headwind to our ads business in 2025,”
primarily from Asian e-commerce companies. He also did not identify specific
companies.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/business/china-tariffs-temu-shein.html
Colby Smith,NYT,1,Business,5/2/2025,Solid Jobs Report Reinforces Fed’s Patient Approach to Interest Rate Cuts,"A solid labor market has for months given the Federal Reserve comfort that it
could hold off on interest rate cuts until it had more clarity about how President
Trump’s policies would impact the economy. New data released on Friday
reinforced that patient approach.
Officials at the central bank are widely expected to keep interest rates steady when
they announce their next decision on May 7. After lowering interest rates by a
percentage point last year, the Fed has since January opted against making
additional reductions. That has left interest rates at a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5
percent.
Until this point, officials have felt little urgency to lower interest rates because the
economy so far has stayed on solid footing. Mr. Trump’s attempts to reset global
trade relations through steep tariffs now risk upending that.
Despite the president’s decision in April to temporarily pause more stringent levies
from taking effect on nearly all of the country’s trading partners, businesses have
struggled to navigate the uncertainty. Many have shelved big investments and
slowed hiring, and some are already raising prices. Surveys suggest that
consumers also have turned much more downbeat about the outlook, fueling
concern that this pessimism will eventually translate to less spending.
The fear is that consumers will cut back so aggressively that businesses will be
forced to lay off workers, worsening the economic slowdown. Jerome H. Powell, the
chair of the central bank, has warned that in addition to denting growth, tariffs of
the nature Mr. Trump is pursuing also risk stoking inflation.

That combination risks putting the Fed in a bind and further in the cross hairs of
Mr. Trump. The president has in recent weeks stepped up his attacks on Mr. Powell,
railing on the Fed chair to lower interest rates. On Friday, he again renewed that
pressures, writing in a social media post: “NO INFLATION, THE FED SHOULD
LOWER ITS RATE!!!”
The central bank is responsible for fostering low, stable inflation as well as a
healthy labor market. Officials are now having to game out what they would do if
their goals for the economy come into tension with one another.

The latest jobs report, which showed better-than-expected monthly payrolls
growth and a steady unemployment rate, is welcome news for officials. It follows
inflation data earlier this week that confirmed that in March, price pressures
stayed somewhat subdued even as it remained above the Fed’s 2 percent target.
Officials are now debating whether the forthcoming surge in consumer prices will
just be a temporary adjustment that fades over time, or if it will lead to persistently
higher inflation.
Having just grappled with surging inflation in the aftermath of the pandemic, the
Fed has stressed the importance of ensuring that tariff-related price pressures do
not mushroom into a bigger problem. Last month, Mr. Powell said that containing
inflation was crucial to fostering a healthy labor market.
“Without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor market
conditions that benefit all Americans,” he said at an event at the Economic Club of
Chicago.
That emphasis suggests there is a high bar for the Fed to restart interest rate cuts.
Officials will need to see clear evidence that the economy is weakening before
taking action, something that could take time.
Christopher J. Waller, a governor, said in a recent interview that he did not expect
tariffs to impact the economy in a significant way before July, suggesting no near-
term cuts.
Preston Mui, a senior economist at research and advocacy group Employ America,
said he expects the labor market to gradually slow over the next couple of months
rather than sharply collapse.
“When it gets sharp is when you have these big spikes in layoffs,” he said. That will
depend on what Mr. Trump does with tariffs. If the president reverses course by
the self-imposed 90-day deadline in early July, the labor market may avoid a more
painful hit. If tariffs remain in place, or the uncertainty around trade policy lingers,
the damage could start to mount.
After Friday’s report, traders in federal funds futures markets scaled back their
expectations for interest rate cuts from the central bank this year. They see much
lower odds of a June reduction but continue to forecast a quarter-point cut in July.
Over the course of the year, they see the Fed cutting at least three times.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/business/fed-jobs-interest-rates.html

Updated April 27, 2025
Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring who said she was
“passed around like a platter of fruit” as a teenager to rich and powerful predators,
including Prince Andrew of Britain, died on Friday at her farm in Western
Australia. She was 41.
Ms. Giuffre (pronounced JIFF-ree) died by suicide, according to a statement by the
family. She wrote in an Instagram post in March that she was days away from
dying of renal failure after being injured in an automobile crash with a school bus
that she said was traveling at nearly 70 miles per hour.
In the statement, her family called her “a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual
abuse and sex trafficking” and “the light that lifted so many survivors.”
In 2019, Mr. Epstein was arrested and charged by federal prosecutors in the
Southern District of New York with sex-trafficking and conspiracy, accused of
soliciting teenage girls to perform massages that became increasingly sexual in
nature.
Virginia Giuffre, Voice in Epstein Sex-
Trafficking Scandal, Dies at 41
Barely a month after he was apprehended, and a day after documents were
released from Ms. Giuffre’s successful defamation suit against him, Mr. Epstein
was found hanged in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower
Manhattan. His death, at 66, was ruled a suicide.
In 2009, Ms. Giuffre, identified then only as Jane Doe 102, sued Mr. Epstein,
accusing him and Ghislaine Maxwell, his co-conspirator and the daughter of the
disgraced British media magnate Robert Maxwell, of recruiting her to join his sex-
trafficking ring when she was a minor under the guise of becoming a professional
masseuse.

In 2015, she was the first of Mr. Epstein’s victims to give up her anonymity and go
public, selling her story to the British tabloid The Mail on Sunday.
“Basically, I was training to be a prostitute for him and his friends who shared his
interest in young girls,” Ms. Giuffre was quoted as saying in Nigel Cawthorne’s
2022 book, “Virginia Giuffre: The Extraordinary Life Story of the Masseuse Who
Pursued and Ended the Sex Crimes of Millionaires Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey
Epstein.”
“Ghislaine told me that I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey,” she said.
Ms. Giuffre accused Mr. Epstein, a multimillionaire financier, and Ms. Maxwell, a
British socialite, of forcing her to have sex with Prince Andrew, also known as the
Duke of York. He flatly denied the accusations, but he relinquished his royal duties
in 2019.
In 2021, she sued the prince, who is the younger brother of King Charles III of
England, contending that he had sexually assaulted her at Ms. Maxwell’s home in
London and at Mr. Epstein’s homes in Manhattan and Little St. James, in the Virgin
Islands.
A widely published photograph showed Prince Andrew with his hand around her
waist. He said he had no memory of the occasion.
After Prince Andrew agreed to settle the suit by Ms. Giuffre in 2022, he praised her
in a statement for speaking out and pledged to “demonstrate his regret” for his
association with Mr. Epstein “by supporting the fight against the evils of sex
trafficking, and by supporting its victims.”
The settlement included an undisclosed sum to be paid to her and to her charity,
now called Speak Out, Act, Reclaim.

District Court — Southern District.
In interviews and depositions, Ms. Giuffre said she was recruited to the sex ring in
2000 while working as a locker room attendant at Mar-a-Lago, President Trump’s
resort in Palm Beach, Fla. By her account, she was reading a massage therapy
manual when she was approached by Ms. Maxwell and invited to become Mr.
Epstein’s traveling masseuse. She said the two of them then groomed her to
perform sexual services for wealthy men.
Ms. Giuffre sued Ms. Maxwell for defamation in 2015 for calling her a liar; they
settled for an undisclosed sum in 2017. Ms. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of sex
trafficking and other counts. The verdict was viewed as the legal reckoning that
Mr. Epstein had denied the judicial system, and his victims, by hanging himself.
Ms. Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Virginia Louise Roberts was born on Aug. 9, 1983, in Sacramento to Sky and Lynn
Roberts. When she was 4, the family moved to Palm Beach County, where her
father was a maintenance manager at Mar-a-Lago.

She said she ran away from home after having been molested by a close family
friend since she was 7. She was placed in foster homes; boarded with an aunt in
California; fled to the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco, the former
hippie haven; lived on the streets when she was 14; and spent six months with a
65-year-old sex trafficker, who abused her.
Compared with living on the streets and earning $9 an hour for her summer job at
Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Epstein’s offer to make $200 a massage several times a day was,
Mr. Cawthorne wrote, one that “Virginia had determined for herself she could not
refuse.”
But her mandate went well beyond those duties, she told the BBC in 2019: She said
that she was “passed around like a platter of fruit” to Mr. Epstein’s friends and
ferried around the world on private jets.
In 2002, when she was 19, Ms. Giuffre enrolled in the International Training
Massage School in Thailand to become a professional masseuse. There she met
Robert Giuffre, an Australian martial arts instructor, and they married.
The couple had three children, Christian, Noah and Emily, and lived in Australia,
Florida and Colorado before settling in Perth in 2020. They have since separated.
He and their children survive her, as do her mother and two brothers, Sky Roberts
and Danny Wilson.
Ms. Giuffre told The Miami Herald in 2019 that the birth of her daughter in 2010
prompted her to speak publicly about her victimization. She explained why she had
originally agreed to work as a masseuse for Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, and to
provide sexual services.
“They seemed like nice people,” she said, “so I trusted them, and I told them I’d had
a really hard time in my life up until then — I’d been a runaway, I’d been sexually
abused, physically abused. That was the worst thing I could have told them,
because now they knew how vulnerable I was.”

Julie Creswell,NYT,1,Business,4/25/2025,RFK Jr. Wants to Ban Food Dyes. Manufacturers Are in No Hurry.,"Same cereal. Same sugary taste. Different hues.
A box of Froot Loops sold in the United States contains vivid rings of red, orange,
green, purple, yellow and blue — neon colors derived from synthetic dyes, like Red
No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Blue No. 1 and Yellow No. 6. In a box sold in Canada, the
colored rings obtain paler shades from the juices of blueberries, watermelon and
huito, an Amazonian fruit. And not a single one is blue.
The manufacturer in both countries, WK Kellogg, formerly known as the Kellogg
Company, can clearly make Froot Loops without synthetic dyes. The question is:
Will it and other big food companies adopt the approach in United States? And will
consumers, raised on color-popping cereals, flame-colored nacho chips and neon
blue sports drinks consume those foods if they are a bit more … beige?
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services, wants them to. On Tuesday, Mr. Kennedy, who has long criticized artificial
dyes used in Froot Loops and other processed foods as part of a larger food system
No More Food Dye in Froot Loops? Not So Fast.
that he says contributes to chronic disease and poor health, announced that he had
reached “an understanding” with major food manufacturers to remove commonly
used petroleum-based food colorings from their products by 2026.
The meaning of “an understanding” remains unclear. No food companies attended
the press conference, and few have said they will remove synthetic colors, which
the Food and Drug Administration currently allows. But a shift may be coming.
This week, citing expected demand from consumers, the beverage giant PepsiCo,
which also makes Doritos and Lay’s potato chips, said it would either phase out
synthetic colors or offer consumers natural color options in the next couple of
years.
Mr. Kennedy is perhaps hoping that using his bully pulpit as head of the agency
that oversees the F.D.A. will be enough to push big food companies to change their
ways. They have responded to pressure before. About a decade ago, a number of
companies tried shifting to natural colors. Most notably, Kraft Macaroni & Cheese
successfully replicated its characteristic orange noodles by switching to turmeric
and paprika. But other companies struggled. Some reverted to synthetic dyes after
sales slumped.
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said he had reached “an understanding” with major food
manufacturers to remove commonly used petroleum-based food colorings from their products by 2026.

For some critics of synthetic dyes, however, Mr. Kennedy’s announcement was a
disappointment. Dr. Peter Lurie, a former F.D.A. official and the executive director
of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the government should move
more forcefully to eliminate the dyes.
“History tells us that relying on voluntary food industry compliance has all too
often proven to be a fool’s errand,” Dr. Lurie said in a statement.
Rewriting the Recipe
No matter how much pressure Washington exerts, shifting to natural colors won’t
happen overnight. It is not as easy as simply replacing Yellow No. 6 with carrot
juice, said James Herrmann, marketing director of food colors at Sensient
Technologies, a company that manufactures colors — both artificial and natural —
for the food and beverage industry.
It can take up to two years to develop the seeds, grow the plants and concoct the
combination of, say, red cabbage and black carrot extract that produces a desired
shade, he said. And it’s not just getting the color right. Food companies are likely to
have to make adjustments to their manufacturing processes and facilities.
Light and heat are enemies of natural colors, causing them to fade, change or even,
in some cases, separate, Mr. Herrmann said. Natural colors must be kept cool, and
they have a relatively short shelf life, which means adding refrigeration and
ensuring a steady supply of them, he said. He added that colors from carrot or beet
juice and their synthetic cousins might have different viscosities, requiring
factories to change pumps or the piping used to apply the colors.
Also, more natural dye is needed to achieve a satisfying color than synthetic dye,
so recipes may have to be reformulated. “Your sugar or flour may be off,” Mr.
Herrmann said.
And that’s assuming enough carrots, cabbage, beets and spirulina (an algae) are
available to replicate the oranges, greens and blues of chips and sports drinks. Mr.
Herrmann, whose company uses proprietary seeds for most of its colorings, said
he wouldn’t “put the seed in the ground for the crop until we know there’s a
customer there for it.”
“If everybody switches at once,” he added, “there is simply not enough material
around the world available to meet the demand.”
Because it can take 10 times as much material from natural colors to mimic a small
amount of synthetic dyes, costs could very likely climb as well.

Late Tuesday, the Consumer Brands Association, the trade organization for the
food industry, said in a statement that the ingredients in the food supply “have
been demonstrated to be safe” and “removing these safe ingredients does not
change the consumer packaged goods industry’s commitment to providing safe,
affordable and convenient product choices to consumers.”
Stacy Flathau, a co-chief corporate affairs officer at WK Kellogg, said in an emailed
statement that 85 percent of its cereals contained no artificial colors, but that it was
removing synthetic colors from those sold in schools. The company added that it
was looking forward to working with the F.D.A. to identify ways to remove artificial
colors from foods containing them.
Growing Colors From Scratch
Concerns about the safety of food colorings, especially regarding behavior in
children, have been on the rise. A 2021 health assessment by the State of California
suggested that “synthetic food dyes are associated with” behaviors “such as
inattentiveness, hyperactivity and restlessness in sensitive children.” In Europe,
food containing some dyes come with a warning label to that effect. Health Canada,
which allows the use of food dyes but with strict restrictions on the amounts, notes
on its website that it deems the evidence of those effects in children to be
insufficient.
California banned artificial dyes in school meals in 2024, and just last month, West
Virginia enacted a statewide ban, the most comprehensive in the country. More
states are considering restrictions.
Sensient had been building its portfolio of natural colors, assuming that, by 2030,
food companies will have moved away from synthetics. But the timeline could be
speeding up.

Sensient develops its natural colors starting with the seed. It has developed a
variety of beets, for instance, that are larger and more saturated in color, Mr.
Herrmann said. The company provides those seeds to contract farmers around the
world. After the produce is harvested, Sensient pulps, pulverizes and strains the
purple sweet potatoes, red radishes and grapes into a rainbow of extracts, powders
and liquids.
The process also eliminates the flavors of most of the underlying fruits, vegetables
or other plants, but not all.
“You’re never going to take the taste out of strawberry juice. It’s going to be a little
acidic, a little strawberry-ish. And that works well for a strawberry flavor in a kids’
cereal,” said Linsey Herman, a vice president of research and development at
Nature’s Path, which makes organic cereals and other foods. “But nobody is dying
for a carrot-flavored cereal.”
Even though the color, whether natural or synthetic, doesn’t often change the taste
profile of the frosted pastry or chip or soda, the appearance does signal certain
flavors — or intensity of flavors — to consumers, said Charles Spence, a professor
of food psychology at the University of Oxford.
“If you reduce the color saturation level of a drink, your mind may tell you it’s
going to taste less sweet or less sour than the original color,” Mr. Spence said.
“Duller hues may signal that this is a duller flavor or stale for some people, while
for others it may signal that it’s a more natural color, something found more in
nature.”
In recent years, Mr. Herrmann said, about 80 percent of new foods and beverages
hitting the market were being made with natural colors. But food companies have
dragged their feet on making the switch with popular existing products over fear
that consumers may spurn them.
“They have to understand what their die-hard fans want,” he said, “and make sure
the natural product reaches the synthetic shades as closely as possible.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/business/rfk-jr-food-dye-ban-

Alan Rappeport;Tony Romm,NYT,1,Business,4/25/2025,Trump Budget to Take Ax to ‘Radical’ Safety Net Programs,"The Trump administration, which has made clear that it aims to slash government
spending, is preparing to unveil a budget proposal as soon as next week that
includes draconian cuts that would entirely eliminate some federal programs and
fray the nation’s social safety net.
The proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year would cut billions of dollars from
programs that support child care, health research, education, housing assistance,
community development and the elderly, according to preliminary documents
reviewed by The New York Times. The proposal, which is being finalized by the
White House’s Office of Management and Budget, also targets longstanding
initiatives that have been prized by Democrats and that Republicans view as
“woke” or wasteful spending.
Technically, the president’s blueprint is merely a formal recommendation to
Congress, which must ultimately adopt any changes to spending. The full extent of
President Trump’s proposed cuts for 2026 is not yet clear. Rachel Cauley, a
spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget, said in a statement that
“no final funding decisions have been made.”
But early indications suggest the budget will aim to formalize Mr. Trump’s
disruptive reorganization of the federal government. That process — largely
overseen by the tech billionaire Elon Musk — has frozen billions of dollars in aid,
shuttered some programs and dismissed thousands of workers from their jobs,
prompting numerous court challenges.
The early blueprint reflects Mr. Trump’s long-held belief that some federal
antipoverty programs are unnecessary or rife with waste, fraud and abuse. And it
echoes many of the ideas espoused by his budget director, Russell T. Vought, a key
architect of Project 2025 who subscribes to the view that the president has
expansive powers to ignore Congress and cancel spending viewed as “woke and
weaponized.” He previously endorsed some of the cuts to housing, education and
other programs that Mr. Trump is expected to unveil in the coming days.
The White House is expected to release the budget as soon as next week, according
to two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to
describe the highly secretive process. The president is expected to couple his
blueprint for 2026 with a second measure — also set for release next week — that
would slash more than $9 billion in previously approved spending for the current
fiscal year, including money that funds PBS and NPR.
In total, the proposed cuts are likely to inform Republican lawmakers as they look
for ways to fund their economic agenda, including a package that would extend
and expand a set of tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump’s first term. Their ambitions
are projected to cost trillions of dollars, though Republican leaders have explored
whether to invoke a budget accounting trick to make it seem as though their tax
package does not add considerably to the federal debt.
In an interview with Time published on Friday, Mr. Trump suggested that he liked
the idea of making millionaires pay higher taxes to help offset tax cuts for others
but also said it would be politically untenable.
Some of the cuts the administration is envisioning could exacerbate the federal
deficit. The White House is looking to reduce about $2.5 billion from the budget of
the Internal Revenue Service with the goal of ending the Biden administration’s
“weaponization of I.R.S. enforcement,” which it said targeted conservatives and
small businesses. Budget scorekeepers have previously said that cuts to the I.R.S.
would reduce the amount of revenue coming into the government, since it would
make it harder for the tax collector to go after businesses and people who owe
money but do not pay.
In many cases, the draft budget slashes many federal antipoverty programs,
generally by cutting their funds and consolidating them into grants sent to the
states to manage. The full extent of those changes is not clear, but the result could
be fewer programs and dollars serving low-income Americans, who may be at risk
of losing some benefits.
Among the most prominent programs that could be eliminated is Head Start, which
provides early education and child care for some of the nation’s poorest children.
Documents reviewed by The Times show the White House is considering a $12.2
billion cut, which would wipe out the program. The budget document says Head
Start uses a “radical” curriculum and gives preference to illegal immigrants. A
description of the program also criticizes it for diversity, equity and inclusion
programming and the use of resources that encourage toddlers to welcome
children and families with different sexual orientations.
Despite the Trump administration’s pledge to make housing more affordable, the
budget draft would reduce funding for several programs that support housing
developments or provide rental assistance. The budget proposes saving $22 billion
by replacing the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s rental
assistance programs with a state-based initiative that would have a two-year cap
on rent subsidies for healthy adults.
The draft budget also eliminates the Home Investment Partnerships Program,
cutting the $1.25 billion fund that provides grants to states and cities for urban
development projects on the basis that it is “duplicative” of other federal housing
programs. It also cuts the $644 million housing block grant programs for Native
Americans and Native Hawaiians, saying that these would be unnecessary because
of new, unspecified initiatives such as enhanced “opportunity zones” that would
give states greater incentives to provide affordable housing.
The overhaul of the nation’s health research apparatus, a few years after the
coronavirus pandemic killed millions of people around the world, could also be
drastic, with about $40 billion in proposed cuts to the Department of Health and
Human Services.
The draft budget recommends cutting $8.8 billion from the National Institutes of
Health, which it declared has “broken the trust of the American people with
wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research and the promotion of
dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.”
The proposal would consolidate and shrink some of the agency’s core functions
that focus on chronic diseases and epidemics. It would entirely eliminate funding
for some divisions, such as the National Institute on Minority Health and Health
Disparities, which would lose the $534 million that it currently receives.
The budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be almost
halved, to $5.2 billion from $9.2 billion. Associated programs such as the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and Public Health Emergency
Preparedness and Response would be eliminated. A note in the preliminary
document refers to overdose prevention funding by the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration as the “Biden crack pipe.”
Although Mr. Trump has said he prioritizes “law and order” in his presidency, his
budget proposes about $2 billion of combined cuts to the F.B.I., the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives. The D.E.A. cuts would scale back international counternarcotics efforts
in European countries that are equipped to crack down on drug trafficking. The
A.T.F. cuts would eliminate offices at the agency that the Trump administration
says have “criminalized law-abiding gun ownership through regulatory fiat.”
The proposal said the goal was to invest in getting F.B.I. agents into the field and to
eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the bureau that were “pet
projects” of the Biden administration.
“Importantly, this administration is committed to undoing the weaponization of the
F.B.I. that pervaded during the previous administration, which included targeting
peaceful, pro-life protesters, concerned parents at school board meetings and
citizens opposed to radical transgender ideology,” said the note explaining the
proposed cuts.
As part of Mr. Trump’s “America First” approach, the budget draft calls for more
than $16 billion in combined cuts for economic and disaster support for Europe,
Eurasia and Central Asia, as well as humanitarian and refugee assistance and
U.S.A.I.D. operations.
“To ensure every tax dollar spent puts America First, all foreign assistance is
paused,” the draft budget document said. “To be clear, this is not a withdrawal from
the world.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/trump-budget-cuts.html
Alisha Haridasani Gupta,NYT,1,Business,4/25/2025,"With Khloud, Khloe Kardashian Will Release a Protein-Packed Popcorn","Cereal. Ice cream. Flavored sparkling water. A Snickers bar. Donuts and brownies.
Candy.
What sounds like the treats table at a child’s birthday party is, in fact, a list of
snacks that can now be found crammed with protein.
Next week, Khloé Kardashian, the reality TV star and entrepreneur, will add her
Khloud Protein Popcorn to the list. Her popcorn will come in three different
flavors: white Cheddar, olive oil and sea salt, and sweet and salty. It will contain 7
grams of protein per serving, derived from the popcorn’s “Khloud Dust,” which is a
blend of milk proteins and seasoning, according to a statement from Ms.
Kardashian’s company, Khloud Foods.
“I’ve always been a snacker and constantly on the lookout for options that are
convenient, healthy, and actually taste good,” Ms. Kardashian said in an emailed
statement. With Khloud, Ms. Kardashian added, she wanted to create a snack that
ticked those boxes and was “something I’d feel good sharing with family and
friends.”
Protein Is in Everything These Days. Even
Popcorn.
The introduction of Khloud Popcorn, which Ms. Kardashian announced on social
media this week, fits with a broader food trend. Experts call it the “proteinification”
of snacks, or desserts, or basically “everything,” said Jonathan Deutsch, a
professor of culinary arts and science at Drexel University and a trend spotter for
the Specialty Food Association, a national organization of food and beverage
businesses. The brands hope to cash in on growing consumer demand for protein,
which is driven largely by social media.
A trend report by Cargill, a company that sources and processes ingredients for
food manufacturers, showed that 61 percent of surveyed consumers noted that
they were hoping to increase their protein intake in 2024, up from 48 percent who
said so in 2019. Sixty-three percent of consumers reported that they were looking
for protein in their snacks in 2024.
The trend also stems from increased use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, like Ozempic
and Mounjaro, said Dr. Lisa Young, a nutrition consultant and adjunct professor of
nutrition at New York University. Those who use the weight-loss drugs report not
only a loss in appetite but also a loss of muscle mass, which means that they are
likely to try to pack as much protein as possible into the little that they do eat.
But, Dr. Young added, even people using GLP-1 drugs need only a fraction more
protein than the recommended amount for an adult, which is 0.8 grams of protein
per kilogram of body weight per day. People on the weight-loss drugs, and those
who do intense workouts, like weight training, are advised to shoot for 1.2 to 1.5
grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.
Protein-enriched snacks, she added, can also fall under the category of ultra-
processed foods, the consumption of which, she cautioned, can add to gut problems.
From a marketing perspective, Mr. Deutsch said, there are only three
macronutrients that the food industry can try to target in its new product lines: fat,
carbs and protein.
“They’re not going to have a ‘fat popcorn’ and they’re not going to have an ‘extra-
carb popcorn,’” he said. “That leaves one macronutrient, right?”
According to Mr. Deutsch, an apple or popcorn “as God made it,” or even just a
glass of water, could be seen as the ideal snacks for most people because, “when
you walk around civil society, you’re not stumbling over people with protein
deficiencies.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/style/khloe-kardashian-protein-

Stanley Reed,NYT,1,Business,4/27/2025,Trump’s Tariffs Squeeze an Already Struggling British Car Industry,"The 25 percent tariffs imposed by President Trump on imported cars have added to
the pressures on vehicle manufacturers around the world, but the pain could be
particularly acute in Britain’s venerable but flagging auto industry.
Britain exports more than 70 percent of the cars that it makes. In 2024, it sent
about 101,000 of those vehicles — about 17 percent of car exports, worth 7.6 billion
pounds (about $10.1 billion) — to the United States, according to the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders, an industry group. Tariffs now threaten to close
what had been one of Britain’s largest markets.
Over the decades, Britain has built a reputation for producing innovative and iconic
vehicles like the Land Rover Defender and the Morris Minor, which helped make
car ownership affordable as the country emerged from World War II.

In recent years, though, the auto industry has struggled to keep pace as it
navigates obstacles including the global shift to electric vehicles and Britain’s exit
from its main export market, the European Union.
The annual number of cars made in Britain has fallen nearly 50 percent since the
end of the last decade, to about 770,000. It now imports far more cars than it
makes.
Given the Trump administration’s rapid policy swings, it is impossible for auto
industry executives to know what level of tariffs will stick. But Washington’s moves
are already bad news for some of Britain’s carmakers, which view the United
States as a crucial growth market.
“This is about a very unsettling move for U.K. manufacturing,” said Peter Wells, a
car expert at Cardiff University in Wales.

in 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters
Mr. Wells said companies would most likely be forced to alter their plans, like
production runs and shipping. “So already it’s costing money to try and deal with
the volatility,” he said.
JLR, the maker of Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles, said it would suspend
shipments to the United States for April. The company, which is owned by India’s
Tata Motors, is one of the largest vehicle manufacturers in Britain, but 28 percent
of its sales over the last year were in North America, where it does not make cars.

Any long-term changes in the United States are likely to have large implications for
Britain’s automakers. The United States last year shipped only 18,000 vehicles to
Britain, which imposes a 10 percent tariff on U.S. imports.
Some European models from American automakers do well in Britain. The Ford
Puma, which is made in Romania in a joint venture, has recently been the top-
selling model in Britain.
British car manufacturing is now dominated by a small group of international
companies, including Nissan, which operates a large plant at Sunderland; BMW,
which makes the Mini; and Toyota.

To keep attracting investment, especially in new electric models, these plants need
to be able to compete with rivals around the planet. Executives and analysts say
the industry faces a raft of challenges, including high energy costs and stress on
the network of suppliers of parts and services after Brexit.

said he expected the market for high-priced brands like JLR “to carry on to be quite
strong.” Sjoerd van der Wal/Getty Images
“Ultimately, the U.K. is not a competitive place to be building cars today,” Alan
Johnson, Nissan’s senior vice president for manufacturing in the region, told a
parliamentary hearing last week.
Stuart Bradley, principal engineer at Warwick Manufacturing Group, a part of the
University of Warwick, said he thought that high-priced brands from carmakers
like JLR or Rolls-Royce Motor Cars might have a brighter future in Britain than
what he called “commodity” producers.
“I think the high-value market is going to carry on to be quite strong,” he said.
The unions that represent the estimated 200,000 workers in auto manufacturing in
Britain worry that the tariffs are just the latest in a series of blows that could lead
to job losses or even plant closings.
Some manufacturers have closed British plants in recent years. In 2021, for
instance, Honda shut down a plant at Swindon that employed 3,500 people.
Unite, a trade union that represents around 70,000 autoworkers, estimates that the
British car industry is operating at just over half capacity, probably sapping the
profitability that comes from spreading costs over large volumes.
“It’s not sustainable,” said Des Quinn, Unite’s national officer for automotive. “The
whole sector is in crisis.”
Much depends on the difficult transition to electric vehicles. The industry says it is
being squeezed by the British government’s requirement to phase out sales of the
bulk of gasoline- and diesel-powered cars by 2030.
Britain had made rapid advances in increasing its electric car fleet. Britain led
Europe, for instance, in sales of electric cars last year, according to the British
government.

bulk of gasoline- and diesel-powered cars by 2030. Chris Jackson Collection, via Getty Images
Critics, though, say strict government-imposed quotas for electric vehicle sales
have encouraged imports of electric vehicles like Teslas, which are made in
Germany or China, at the expense of the domestic industry. Chinese automakers
like BYD are also making inroads.
The question is whether the British-based makers can catch up in the coming years
— especially in the production of smaller, cheaper electric cars for ordinary
consumers.
“I’m not entirely confident that all of the industry will come through unscathed,”
Mr. Wells said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/business/trump-tariffs-uk-cars.html
Colby Smith,NYT,1,Business,4/26/2025,Bessent Seeks to Reassure Global Leaders on Dollar’s Role as Safe Haven,"On the sidelines of the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to convey an
important message about the United States dollar.
Speaking to a crowd of global policymakers, regulators and investors, Mr. Bessent
sought to allay fears that had ballooned in recent weeks about the dollar’s global
standing and the country’s role as the safest haven during times of stress. He
reiterated that the administration would continue to have a “strong-dollar policy”
and affirmed that it would remain the currency that the rest of the world wanted to
hold, even though it had weakened against most major currencies.
For participants at the event, Mr. Bessent’s comments were a needed salve after a
bruising couple of weeks in financial markets as a result of President Trump’s trade
war. Violent swings in stocks, coinciding with the weakening of the dollar as
investors fled U.S. government bonds, had incited panic.
Dollar Doubts Dominate
Gathering of Global
Economic Leaders
The fact that Mr. Bessent found it necessary to emphasize that message in front of
such a big crowd underscored how precarious the situation had become since Mr.
Trump returned to the White House less than 100 days ago. What now looms large
are uncomfortable questions about what happens if the international community
starts to lose faith in the dollar and other U.S. assets, something that economists
warn would be costly for Americans.
“People are playing through scenarios that previously had been judged
unthinkable, and they’re playing them through in a very serious kind of way in the
spirit of contingency planning,” said Nathan Sheets, the chief economist at
Citigroup and a Treasury official in the Obama administration.
“If the United States is going to pursue aggressive economic policies, it’s natural
for the rest of the world to step back and say, ‘Well, do we want to buy U.S. assets
as we have in the past?’”
‘New World Order’
At a similar gathering hosted by the I.M.F. and World Bank six months ago,
attendees were preparing for an entirely different economic backdrop. Convening
less than two weeks before the presidential election, they still had in their sights a
rare soft landing in which the major central banks finished their fight against high
inflation while managing to avoid a recession.

The tariffs Mr. Trump had been talking about on the campaign trail were top of
mind, but for the most part, they were viewed as a negotiating tactic. Any turn
toward protectionism was widely expected to push up the value of the dollar
compared with other currencies. The rationale was that tariffs would lower
demand for imported goods, since they would make them more expensive for
American consumers, and over time result in fewer dollars being exchanged for
foreign currencies.
But since Inauguration Day, the opposite has occurred. An index that tracks the
dollar against a basket of major trading partners has fallen nearly 10 percent in the
last three months. It now hovers near a three-year low. The sharpest slide came
after Mr. Trump announced large tariffs on nearly all imports in April. While he
temporarily reversed course, the dollar has yet to recoup its losses.
There are reasons not to read too much into its recent weakening. The U.S.
economic outlook has fundamentally changed. Businesses are “frozen” by tariffs,
Christopher J. Waller, a governor at the Federal Reserve, said this week as he
warned about layoffs stemming from the uncertainty.
Economists have sharply scaled back their estimates for growth while raising their
estimates for inflation, a combination that carries a whiff of stagflation. In that
environment, it is not surprising that the dollar and other U.S. assets appear less
appealing.
Dollar depreciation — even if extreme — also does not necessarily translate to a
loss of stature in the global financial system. There have been previous big drops in
the value of the dollar that have not incited a wholesale shift away from the
currency’s primacy, said Jonas Goltermann, the deputy chief markets economist at
Capital Economics.
Earlier entries about North American tariffs
But at this year’s spring meetings, there was a palpable sense that something more
ominous could be taking place. Joyce Chang, JPMorgan’s chair of global research,
noted a disconnect between domestic and international participants at the
conference that the Wall Street bank hosted during the week of the meetings.
U.S.-based investors appeared less concerned about a structural shift away from
the country’s assets and more focused on the ways in which Mr. Trump could
course-correct on his economic policies. International investors were consumed by
the prospects of a “regime change” in the financial system and a “new world order,”
Ms. Chang said.
Mr. Trump had recently escalated his attacks on Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair,
fanning fears about how much the administration would encroach on the central
bank’s independence. That longstanding separation from the White House is
broadly seen as essential to the smooth functioning of the financial system.
“The dollar’s role in the system was not ordained from above,” said Mark Sobel, a
former Treasury official who is the U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and
Financial Institutions Forum. “It’s a reflection of the properties of the United
States.”
Those include a large economy that transacts with the world; the financial
system’s deepest, most liquid capital markets; a credible central bank; and the rule
of law.
“I do believe that Trump is doing permanent damage,” Mr. Sobel said.
Few Alternatives
It is hard to overstate the dominance of the dollar globally, meaning there are real
limitations to how significantly private and public investors can diversify away
from it, even if they want to.
Most trade is invoiced in dollars. It is the leading currency for international
borrowing. Central banks also prefer to hold dollar assets more than anything else,
and by a wide margin.
“Anybody who’s looking for diversification has to be realistic,” said Isabelle Mateos
y Lago, the chief economist at BNP Paribas. “Reserve assets, by definition, have to
be liquid.”
Alternatives do exist, but they are hobbled by their own weaknesses. China lacks
open, deep and liquid capital markets, and its currency does not float freely,
tarnishing its appeal globally. Top European leaders — including Christine
Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank — have talked more readily
about bolstering the prominence of the euro, something that is considered more
plausible now that countries like Germany are stepping up their spending. But the
amount of available euro-denominated safe assets pales in comparison with that of
U.S. capital markets.
Still, in the recent period of volatility, investors have found a number of places to
take cover. The euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen have been clear beneficiaries.
Gold has rallied sharply, too.
“You don’t need to have the role of the dollar as a reserve asset go to zero,” said Ms.
Mateos y Lago. “A multipolar system can totally work.”
Burden or Privilege?
When asked at Wednesday’s event, which was hosted by the Institute for
International Finance, whether the dollar’s reserve currency status was a burden
or a privilege, Mr. Bessent said: “I actually am not sure that anyone else wants it.”
But economists warn that Americans would be losing clear benefits if the
government was too cavalier about the dollar’s shedding its special status.
The country’s exporters would reap rewards, as a weaker dollar would make their
products more competitive. However, that advantage could come at the expense of
reduced spending power for Americans abroad and higher borrowing costs at a
time when the government has huge financing needs.
Despite the pain that Americans may have to bear, the global financial system
would be far more “resilient” if other currencies shared the dollar’s global role over
time, said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California,
Berkeley. During times of stress, that would mean multiple sources of liquidity.
However, three months into Mr. Trump’s second term, Mr. Eichengreen warned
that a “dire scenario is now on the table” — a sharp sell-off of dollar-denominated
assets into cash.
“A chaotic rush out of the dollar would be a crisis,” he said. “All of a sudden, the
world would not have the international liquidity that 21st-century globalization
depends on.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/26/business/dollar-trump-bessent.html
Elian Peltier,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,How Pope Francis Challenged and Embraced Africa’s Rising Catholic Population,"When Pope Francis presided over a Mass that incorporated elements of Congolese
tradition in St. Peter’s Basilica in 2019, it was seen as a sign of his enduring
commitment to Roman Catholics across Africa.
When he visited African migrants in southern Italy and later kissed the feet of
South Sudan’s two competing warlords, his actions drew more attention to his
focus on a continent where the number of Catholics is growing faster than
anywhere else in the world.
“Being from Latin America, he felt for our predicaments as a third-world continent
struggling in a world controlled from far away,” said Cardinal John Onaiyekan, the
former archbishop of Abuja, Nigeria, who voted in the 2013 conclave that elected
Francis.
Could the Next Pope Be From Africa?

of Congo? Sign up for Your Places: Global Update, and we’ll send our
latest coverage to your inbox.
As Cardinal Onaiyekan and his peers prepare to meet in the Sistine Chapel next
week to elect the new pope after Francis’ death, the question of how Africa’s rising
Catholic population might shape the next papacy and the church’s future has
become more timely than ever.
About a fifth of Africa’s population, roughly 280 million people, are Catholic. Nearly
a fifth of all Catholics are Africans, and that balance is changing: According to the
Vatican, more than half of the 13 million people who joined the church in 2022 were
in Africa.
Mourning Pope Francis in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo, last week. Francis visited the country in

Africa produces the highest number of seminarians in the world. Of the 135
cardinals who will name the next pope, 18 are from Africa.
Francis’ legacy in Africa is mixed, with some crediting him for adapting church
teachings to African customs and others saying his messages at times felt out of
touch with the diverse and strongly held beliefs that animate many African
societies.
On same-sex marriage and divorce, Francis’ blessing of same-sex couples faced a
strong rebuke from African bishops and many Catholics in countries where
homosexuality remains criminalized, stigmatized or taboo. The resistance from
African bishops highlighted their growing influence within the church, observers
say.
“Pope Francis had a certain solidarity with Africa, and I think his teachings on
social issues were appreciated,” said Father Giulio Albanese, an Italian missionary
who worked in Uganda in the 1980s and accompanied Francis on two trips to
Africa. “But sometimes the openness of the people is not accepted by the bishops.”
Francis visited 10 African countries over five trips throughout his 12-year papacy,
while his predecessor visited the continent twice.
Among Francis’ potential successors from Africa is Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, the
65-year-old archbishop of Kinshasa, whom Francis made a cardinal in 2019, who
was a member of his Council of Cardinals and who led the opposition to the
Vatican’s declaration allowing the church to bless homosexual couples.
That opposition essentially forced Francis to let African bishops ignore the policy.

Congo Cathedral in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. Hardy Bope/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images
Other African contenders include Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, who was a
candidate in the 2013 conclave and holds views similar to Francis’ on climate
change, social justice and homosexuality.
On the other end of the spectrum is Cardinal Robert Sarah of Guinea, who was a
leading opponent of Francis and his attempts to modernize the church.
The election of an African pope would most likely usher in an era of conservatism,
in line with the traditional views of many African Catholics.
On many topics, however, African Catholics said Francis had preached values close
to their hearts, including a more respectful relationship to nature, interreligious
dialogue with Islam and the importance of incorporating local traditions into one’s
faith.
Even on homosexuality, many said Francis’ approach was one of subtlety that
resonated in Africa and made the church’s doctrine more appealing on a continent
with the world’s highest share of young people.
“Pope Francis’ stance on homosexuals was one of both reaffirming traditional
Catholic teaching while also advocating for greater inclusivity and respect,” said
Brian Mboh, 28, who is Catholic and a communications professional from
Cameroon, where homosexuality is criminalized.

During a private audience with the pope in 2023, Sheila Leocádia Pires, a
communications officer for the Southern African Catholic Bishops’ Conference, said
she raised the issue of single mothers’ being deprived of the Eucharist in Africa.
“All are welcome,” was his answer, said Ms. Pires.
For all of Francis’ attention to Africa, Catholics there noted that his influence and
calls for peace yielded few results.
The war in the Democratic Republic of Congo entered a new deadly phase this
year. African migrants still face deadly obstacles in the perilous journey to Europe.
The two competing leaders of South Sudan are threatening a new war.
“They forgot how he knelt down and kissed their feet since they’re at each other’s
throats again,” said Cardinal Onaiyekan.
Others said the care and attention Francis gave to Africa would be what they
remembered about him most.
“Our country was at war but he still came here to share our suffering,” said
Eugenie Ndumba, a parish lecturer in Congo, which Francis visited in 2023.
“He knew where his children were, and he made sure he went toward them.”

Ana Swanson;Jack Ewing,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,Trump Signs Executive Order Walking Back Some Auto Tariffs,"President Trump signed a pair of executive orders on Tuesday that walked back
some tariffs for carmakers, removing levies that Ford, General Motors and others
have complained would backfire on U.S. manufacturing by raising the cost of
production and squeezing their profits.
The changes will modify Mr. Trump’s tariffs so carmakers that pay a 25 percent
tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, for example on steel and
aluminum, or on certain imports from Canada and Mexico, according to the orders.
However, the rules do not appear to protect automakers from tariffs on steel and
aluminum that their suppliers pay and pass on.
Carmakers will also be able to qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of the cost of
their imported components, though those benefits will be phased out over the next
two years.
At a rally in Michigan on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said that he was showing “a
little flexibility” to the automakers but that he wanted them to make their
components in the United States.
Trump Grants Carmakers Some Relief From His
Punishing Tariffs
“We gave them a little time before we slaughter them if they don’t do this,” he said.
The decision to reduce the scope of the tariffs is the latest sign that the Trump
administration’s decision to impose stiff levies on nearly all trading partners has
created challenges and economic uncertainty for American companies. But even
with the concessions announced Tuesday, administration policies will add
thousands of dollars to car prices and endanger the financial health of automakers
and their suppliers, analysts said.
Mr. Trump signed the executive orders aboard Air Force One as he flew to
Michigan, home to America’s largest automakers, for a speech marking his 100
days in office.
Automakers have welcomed any relaxation of tariffs, which they said would raise
car prices, cause sales to fall and threaten their financial viability. But the steps will
leave in place a 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles that took effect April 3, and a
tariff on auto parts that will take effect on Saturday. That will still raise prices for
new and used cars by thousands of dollars and increase the cost of repairs and
insurance premiums.
On Tuesday, General Motors abandoned a previous forecast for solid profit growth
this year as a result of the uncertainty created by Mr. Trump’s trade policies. The
carmaker, which sells more vehicles in the United States than any other company,
said any profit prediction would be a “guess.”
“The prior guidance cannot be relied upon,” Paul Jacobson, G.M.’s chief financial
officer, said during a conference call with reporters.
The automaker also postponed a conference call with financial analysts to discuss
its first-quarter results, citing the Trump administration’s expected change to tariff
policy. The company will now hold the call on Thursday.

See every major action by the Trump administration ›
The move comes just weeks after the administration exempted smartphones,
computers, semiconductors and other electronics from its punishing China tariffs
over concerns from companies like Apple that the import taxes would cause prices
for U.S. consumers to skyrocket.
On Tuesday, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, said that the changes
stemmed from direct conversations with domestic automakers, and that the
administration had been in “constant contact” with the companies to analyze their
business and make sure they got the policy exactly right.
“Donald Trump and his presidency are going to bring domestic auto manufacturing
back,” Mr. Lutnick said.
The Trump administration has not admitted that the tariffs will hurt U.S.
automakers. But on Tuesday it seemed to acknowledge that rolling back the tariffs
would help them. In one order signed on Tuesday, the president said the changes
would help reduce the industry’s reliance on foreign manufacturing and encourage
companies to expand their domestic production.
For one year, the administration will offer automakers an exemption from its auto
parts tariffs for 15 percent of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price of an
automobile assembled in the United States. That would drop to 10 percent in the
second year, and then be eliminated in the third year.

Ana Swanson
Times reporter covering the Trump tariffs
“I have been reporting on economics, trade and international relations for over a
decade, from both China and the U.S. I aim to underpin my work with data and
numbers, as well as give voice to the personal stories of people I encounter in my
reporting.”
Here’s our latest reporting on economic policy and tariffs.
Automakers that assemble cars in the United States will be able to apply for this
so-called offset by submitting documentation to the government about their
projected imports and tariff costs.
In a second executive order, Mr. Trump detailed new rules that will exempt
companies that pay one kind of tariff from paying others. The president said that
when one import was subject to multiple kinds of tariffs, the tariffs should not
“‘stack’ on top of one another” because the resulting tariffs were higher than
necessary.
The order said carmakers paying a 25 percent tariff to bring in cars and car parts
would not be subject to tariffs that Mr. Trump had placed on steel and aluminum or
on imports from Canada and Mexico.
Products that are subject to the tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico will no
longer be subject to tariffs on steel and aluminum, the order said. But it said goods
that were charged tariffs on their steel content would still be charged tariffs on any
aluminum content.
Other duties will still be charged on all of the items, including the tariffs that Mr.
Trump has imposed on China and tariffs imposed for trade violations, like dumping
and unfair subsidization.
The latest rules also leave in place an exemption for parts imported from Canada
and Mexico that comply with a treaty that Mr. Trump negotiated during his first
term. Both countries are major suppliers to the U.S. auto industry.
The exemption buys carmakers some time, said Lenny LaRocca, U.S. automotive
industry leader at the consulting firm KPMG. “It gives them a little bit of time to
plan out what their strategy could be,” he said.
But automakers and suppliers say two years is not enough time for them to
reorganize their manufacturing operations. Even if they do, they will not be able to
make many components as cheaply in the United States as they do elsewhere,
which will lead to higher prices.
Even cars manufactured in the United States typically use far more imported parts
than would be covered by an exemption. Most cars also contain components from
Japan, South Korea or China that will be subject to tariffs.
“Relief today doesn’t fix the longer-term challenge,” analysts at Bernstein said in a
note Tuesday. “U.S. car prices are heading higher just as economic momentum
fades.”
Nevertheless, auto executives expressed gratitude that Mr. Trump had addressed
at least some of their concerns. In a statement on Monday, Mary T. Barra, the chief
executive of G.M., said the company appreciated “productive conversations with
the president and his administration.”
“The president’s leadership is helping level the playing field for companies like
G.M. and allowing us to invest even more in the U.S. economy,” she said.
“Stellantis appreciates the tariff relief measures decided by President Trump,”
John Elkann, chairman of the company that owns Dodge, Jeep, Ram and Chrysler,
said in a statement. “While we further assess the impact of the tariff policies on our
North American operations, we look forward to our continued collaboration with
the U.S. administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and
stimulate exports.”
The executives also hinted that they hoped continued talks with administration
officials would lead to further concessions. “We will continue to work closely with
the administration in support of the president’s vision for a healthy and growing
auto industry in America,” Jim Farley, the chief executive of Ford, said in a
statement.
The exemption appears to have been engineered in part by Mr. Lutnick, who has
played a role in securing lucrative exemptions for some industries in recent
months. In a statement on Monday, he called the deal “a major victory for the
president’s trade policy” and said it would provide “runway to manufacturers who
have expressed their commitment to invest in America.”
Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow with the Mercatus Center, called the
move a “shakedown” by the Trump administration, saying it had imposed pain on
automakers and then demanded promises of investments from them.
“The Trump tariffs created a crisis for automakers, and now the administration is
offering partial relief,” she said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-auto-tariffs-executive-order.html
Damien Cave,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,Ho Chi Minh City Celebrates the Fall of Saigon With a Parade,"Vietnam marked the 50th anniversary of the end of what it calls the American War
on Wednesday with a boisterous parade in Ho Chi Minh City featuring soldiers,
dancers and speeches celebrating what the country’s communist leader called “a
triumph of justice.”
The event brought tens if not hundreds of thousands, according to state media,
including many who camped out overnight for the morning’s festivities.
“The atmosphere was very special,” said Nguyen Thi Song Anh, 18, who joined
some 12th-grade classmates on a crowded sidewalk near the Opera House. “It was
important for me to feel part of this country — and part of this history.”
The scenes of celebration, with a sea of red and yellow representing the flag of
Vietnam in front of high-end French and American retailers, pointed to just how
distant the final day of this country’s grueling war has become.

Ho Chi Minh City, also still known as Saigon, is now a vibrant metropolis of 9
million people, where skyscrapers shadow the handful of buildings with wartime
history and the streets are filled with locally made electric vehicles and young
people snapping selfies for Instagram.
To Lam, the top leader of the Communist Party of Vietnam, acknowledged a need for greater

On most days, people will tell you the war is irrelevant, too old for concern, except
perhaps as a source of gritty stories that drive the young to be grateful for what
they have.
But April 30 is different.
Every year, Vietnam honors the dead and recounts how the underdogs of the North
definitively defeated the French, the Americans and ultimately South Vietnam.
On Wednesday, To Lam, the top leader of the Communist Party of Vietnam, struck
many of the usual chords in a speech before international visitors, which did not
include the U.S. ambassador.
But the U.S. Consul General, Susan Burns, was there — a softening of an earlier
directive from Washington barring senior diplomats from anniversary events.
Mr. Lam described the conflict as a struggle for national independence and a
resistance movement against French colonialism and U.S. aggression. He
celebrated “the liberation of the South,” which Washington has generally referred
to as “the fall of Saigon.”


Vietnam also included troops from China in Wednesday’s parade for the first time,
providing public recognition of Beijing’s assistance during the war. However it was
not a huge surprise: A video of Chinese troops at a rehearsal singing the popular
patriotic song, “As If Uncle Ho Were With Us on the Day of Great Victory” had
already been shared widely on social media.
Still, there were also hints of a more conciliatory approach to past enemies. Even
as Vietnam grits its teeth in negotiations with the White House over proposed
tariffs set (and postponed) at 46 percent, Mr. Lam noted that 2025 is also when the
U.S. and Vietnam celebrate 30 years of diplomatic ties.
Reaffirming an essay he published Sunday, acknowledging a need for greater
reconciliation between North and South, he also spoke about “respecting
differences.”
“All Vietnamese are sons and daughters of this country,” he said. “All are entitled to
live, to work, to pursue happiness and love.”
The parade brought together many international visitors. The U.S. ambassador did not attend, but the

The parade featured soldiers, dancers and speeches celebrating what Mr. Lam called “a triumph of

Ms. Song Anh, the 12th-grader, like many others on the parade route, found the
message compelling. Her grandfathers had fought for the North, but she said it
was time to “overcome our biases.”
“We are all Vietnamese,” she said. “We all carry a sense of pride.”
On Wednesday, it was on full display. Billboards juxtaposed Ho Chi Minh’s gaze
with images of new bridges, connecting past struggles to modern development.
Families sang patriotic songs. The young and hip snapped photos of helicopters
flying over Independence Palace, the seat of the South’s government, which
northern troops seized on April 30, 1975.
Asked if there was anything they would change, a few parade-goers spoke about
the need to eliminate corruption, to create an economy that served all more
equally.
But many also pointed with admiration to new buildings that would have been
unimaginable in the 1970s and ’80s, when the war-wrecked economy was on its
knees.
“It’s so emotional, to see all the development and changes happening in Vietnam,”
said Tran Quang Duc, 67, who had traveled from the province that Ho Chi Minh was
from and wore his military uniform on Wednesday.
“I don’t think anyone would want to fight Vietnam now,” he added, noting that he
fought the Chinese in the war that broke out in 1979. “We’re strong and confident.”
We met beside the Rex hotel, where the U.S. military used to hold its briefings,
claiming the war was being won. Reporters called them the “five o’clock follies.”


A statue of Ho Chi Minh now stands nearby. Vu Thi Ninh Thuy, 42, gathered there
after the parade to take pictures with a few friends. She said she had come out
early that morning because the 50th anniversary was a singular event.
“I wanted to be part of it,” she said. “I wanted to feel what it was like to live in
historic times.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/asia/saigon-parade-vietnam-

Jack Nicas,NYT,1,World,4/17/2025,Hundreds of Capybaras ‘Conquered’ This Town. Now What?,"Luciano Sampietro lifted a three-foot aluminum pipe to his lips and blew, sending a
blow dart laced with sedatives, muscle relaxers and painkillers toward the world’s
largest rodent, lounging near an artificial pond.
The veterinarian’s target, a roughly 110-pound alpha male capybara, was hit in the
hind leg. Mr. Sampietro fired again and struck a female. Within 15 minutes, workers
dressed in the tan outfits of safari guides scooped up the sleeping patients.
But they were too late: The female was already pregnant. So they injected the male
with a drug designed to stop him from impregnating any more.
Yes, in the wealthy suburbs of Buenos Aires, they are sterilizing the capybaras.
The world’s largest rodent is multiplying in — and dividing — one of Argentina’s most
exclusive gated communities.

The rotund, laid-back, dog-sized rodents native to South America have recently
become a darling of the modern internet. They have catapulted to the top of the
unofficial adorable animal rankings via countless videos showing them mellow,
plump and perfectly happy to let monkeys and ducks ride on their backs. Their
image adorns backpacks and stuffed animals, and in Tokyo, tourists pay premiums
to feed them carrots at capybara cafes.
But to some people in one corner of their native land, the cuddly capybara has
become a menace.
Since the pandemic, “carpinchos,” as they are known in Argentina, have
proliferated in Nordelta, a ritzy, picturesque gated community of 45,000 people
north of Buenos Aires. When residents retreated indoors in 2020, the capybaras
began to colonize the manicured neighborhoods, finding green grass, fresh water
and no predators, according to biologists hired by the community.
Over the past two years, the biologists estimate Nordelta’s capybara population
has tripled to nearly 1,000, posing a tricky test case for the urban coexistence of
humans and wildlife.
On a visit last month, capybara families grazed near the tennis courts, dozed on the
volleyball courts and waded in the artificial lagoons. Just past a sign warning of
crossing capybaras, a family crossed the street in a single-file line, illuminated by
waiting headlights.
Sure, most residents admitted, the capybaras are cute. But they also cause traffic
accidents, chomp their way through gardens and, on occasion, have attacked some
of the community’s smallest dogs.
“It’s a wild animal versus a domesticated dog. I mean, it’s totally different,” said Mr.
Sampietro, the veterinarian hired to help manage the capybara population. “I’ve
had to do necropsies on capybaras and it’s difficult to cut the hide with a knife.”

Pablo Pefaure, one of Nordelta’s 26 neighborhood representatives, said his
neighbors frequently complain to him about the amphibious rodents. “They see
them as dangerous, they see them as invasive, they fear for their young children,”
he said.
He said that capybaras have sometimes followed his miniature schnauzer,
Grumete. “I don’t leave him alone in the garden because I don’t know what might
happen,” he said.
His neighbor sitting nearby, Veronica Esposito, did not agree. “No capybara has
ever approached my dogs,” she said. “Everyone says they eat the plants. Yes, they
do. But the plants grow back,” she added. “I don’t see the problem.”
Ms. Esposito is one of a small group of neighbors leading a rebellion against the
capybara controls. They have protested in the streets, taken legal action against
developers and gathered 25,000 signatures for an online petition to protect the
animals. They’ve also attracted 34,000 followers to an Instagram page where they
sometimes shame their neighbors, including one who had used a whip to scare
capybaras off her dock.
“I believe their adorableness is a strategy of the species itself to survive,” said
Silvia Soto, the most vocal neighbor. “Their lovability has conquered us, and we’re
fighting for them.”

So far, the fight has not worked. Last year, Argentina’s national government began
an experiment to perform vasectomies on three capybaras in Nordelta, hoping to
track how it affected the males’ standing in their packs. If successful, the practice
could be expanded.
In February, the Nordelta organization told residents in an email that it was
moving ahead with a different plan: a “contraceptive vaccination program,”
approved by the local government, to sterilize 250 adult capybaras.
Costanza Falguera, the organization’s lead biologist, said her team is using a
“vaccine” that halts the production of sperm and inhibits ovulation. It requires two
injections several months apart, but then might last only for several months,
meaning they might have to keep tranquilizing the capybaras repeatedly.
They aren’t sure how long the sterilization lasts because the drug — Improvac,
made by a New Jersey drug maker, Zoetis — has not been used on capybaras. It is
designed to alter pigs’ hormones before slaughter so the meat tastes better. “Only
for use in male pigs,” Zoetis says on its disclaimer for the drug.
In 2019, Nordelta sprayed its grass with the scent of a carnivore, scaring off many
capybara. But Ms. Falguera said the efficacy dropped over time as the capybara in
Nordelta became long removed from having regular predators.

Thirty years ago, Nordelta was largely untouched wetlands where capybaras roamed freely. It has since
become home to some of Argentina’s richest people.
So, she said, the community settled on the injections, which she said are better than
castration or vasectomies because they are less likely to alter the rodents’ behavior
and group dynamics.
In other words, they still mate, she said, “but they don’t fertilize.”
The decision to sterilize the capybaras ultimately rested with one of Argentina’s
richest men, Eduardo Constantini, an entrepreneur and real estate developer
whose company controls the Nordelta organization. His spokeswoman did not
respond to requests for comment.
To the capybara advocates, intervening in the animals’ reproduction is an
escalation of Nordelta’s attack on the species.
Thirty years ago, Nordelta was largely untouched wetlands where capybaras
roamed freely, hunted by pumas, jaguars, caiman and sport hunters. In the late
1990s, Mr. Constantini began transforming the area with roads, ponds, mansions,
condo towers, a shopping center and a golf course designed by the American golfer
Jack Nicklaus. Construction has been nearly nonstop — with 17 more buildings
underway now — and it is now home to some of Argentina’s richest people.

Ms. Soto argued that the capybara population is only increasing because
developers destroyed the animals’ wild habitat, forcing them out of the forest and
into the suburbs.
“In a matter of hours they knock down a forest,” Ms. Soto said. “What happened to
the wildlife? Have they died? Have they been displaced?”
Her group is pushing for the capybara to be given their own nature reserve, but
there appears to be little interest from Nordelta’s developers. “I don’t understand
how they can only think of vasectomy and sterilization,” she said.

On a recent weekday, as capybara grazed on a playground, Lidia Schmidt and
Felipo Contigiani walked past, hardly noticing. The married couple agreed the
capybara population had to be checked somehow, but they did not see eye to eye on
the causes of the problem.
Mr. Contigiani, who said that he used to hunt capybara as a child, had less
sympathy for the animals. “It’s a wild animal that came to live in the city,” he said.
His wife corrected him. “No, the city came to settle where the wild animal was,” she
said. “It’s the other way around.”

Karen Zraick,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,"Man Accused of Hacking Climate Groups Can Be Sent to U.S., Judge Says","An English court on Wednesday approved the extradition of an Israeli man
charged by New York prosecutors with running a “hacking-for-hire” operation that
targeted environmental groups.
Prosecutors say that companies run by the man, Amit Forlit, 57, earned at least $16
million by hacking more than 100 victims and stealing confidential information on
behalf of a lobbying firm working for a major oil company.
Lawyers for Mr. Forlit identified the company as ExxonMobil in a January court
filing. Exxon has been sued by Democratic attorneys general and other local
officials over its role in climate change. The lawsuits claim the company covered up
what it knew about climate change for decades to continue selling oil. The lobbying
firm was identified in the filing as DCI Group.
An Exxon statement said the company had not been involved in and was not aware
of any hacking. “If there was any hacking involved, we condemn it in the strongest
possible terms,” the statement said.
A spokesman for DCI, Craig Stevens, said the firm instructs employees and
consultants to comply with the law and that no one at DCI had directed or was
involved “in any hacking alleged to have occurred a decade ago.”
DCI also said that “radical anti-oil activists and their billionaire donors, many of
whom still sleep on beds paid for by their family’s fossil-energy legacy trust funds,
peddle conspiracy theories” about the firm.
That was an apparent reference to the role of the Rockefeller family in supporting
organizations advocating for climate-change litigation. Heirs of John D. Rockefeller,
who made his fortune in oil more than a century ago, today lead a foundation, the
Rockefeller Family Fund, that plays a key role in the movement to sue oil
companies over climate change. Lee Wasserman, its director, has said he was
targeted by the hacking campaign.
Mr. Forlit was arrested in London last year following a grand jury indictment in
New York on charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and
conspiracy to commit computer hacking, which could carry a lengthy sentence. His
lawyers had argued that he should not be extradited because he would not receive
a fair trial in the United States because of the political firestorm over climate
change litigation.
They argued that “one of the reasons underpinning the prosecution is to advance
the politically motivated cause of pursuing ExxonMobil, with Mr. Forlit a form of
collateral damage.”
His lawyers also argued that Mr. Forlit would be in danger at the Metropolitan
Detention Center, the only federal jail in New York, which has been plagued by
violence and dysfunction. High-profile defendants recently held there have
included Luigi Mangione, Sam Bankman-Fried and Sean Combs, also known as
Puff Daddy and Diddy.
The Westminster Magistrates’ Court rejected those concerns. Mr. Forlit can appeal
the decision. His lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
One of the groups targeted was the Union of Concerned Scientists, which has long
researched the fossil fuel industry’s role in what it calls climate science
disinformation. The group also does source-attribution science, the practice of
using data to estimate the contributions made by specific corporations to the
effects of global warming, like sea level rise or wildfires. Its work has been cited in
lawsuits against the oil industry.
The organization learned of the hacking from a 2020 report by Citizen Lab, a
cybersecurity watchdog group at the University of Toronto, according to Kathy
Mulvey of the Union of Concerned Scientists. The report found that hackers had
targeted American nonprofit groups working on a campaign called #ExxonKnew,
which argued that the company had hidden information about climate change.
Numerous Union of Concerned Scientists employees received suspicious emails in
which hackers tried to trick them into giving up passwords or installing malicious
software. Prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of
New York began an investigation.
One associate of Mr. Forlit, Aviram Azari, pleaded guilty in New York in 2023 to
crimes including computer intrusion, wire fraud and identity theft and was
sentenced to six years in prison.
Mr. Forlit ran three security and intelligence-gathering firms, two registered in
Israel and one in the United States, that hired people to hack into email accounts
and devices, the filing said. His clients included a Washington lobbying firm
working on behalf of “one of the world’s largest oil and gas corporations, centered
in Irving, Texas, in relation to ongoing climate change litigation being brought
against it.” Exxon was previously headquartered in Irving.
The lobbying firm identified targets to Mr. Forlit, then he or another person gave a
list to Mr. Azari, who owned another Israel-based firm and hired people in India to
illegally access the accounts, the filing said. Those details were used to obtain
documents that were given to the oil company and the media “to undermine the
integrity of the civil investigations,” the filing said.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/climate/hacking-for-hire-exxon-forlit-

said on Wednesday, after three people were fatally shot the day before, in the latest
blow to a country grappling with high levels of gun violence compared to its
European peers.
The three victims were found in a hair salon in the city of Uppsala, about 43 miles
from Stockholm, the capital. They were between 15 and 20 years old, according to
the police, but have not been publicly identified.
The motive was unclear, but the police, who said they responded to reports of “loud
bangs” shortly after 5 p.m. on Tuesday, said they were investigating if the shooting
had been gang-related.
“We can’t say that it has a clear connection to any gang conflict at the moment, but
it’s one of the ideas that we are working particularly intensively on,” Erik Akerlund,
head of the Uppsala police and of the special incident command, said at a news
conference on Wednesday morning.
Teenager Is Arrested on Suspicion of Murder
After 3 Are Shot in Sweden
The teenage suspect, who was not identified, had recently run away from a group
home for children, Magnus Berggren, Uppsala’s deputy chief prosecutor, said
during a news conference later on Wednesday.
Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, condemned the shooting as “a terrible
act” and lamented that “brutal and ruthless violence is once again shaking our
country.”
Despite its reputation for a high standard of living, Sweden has been plagued by
one of the higher rates of gun violence in the European Union, and violent crime
has been on the rise in recent years. The country experienced its worst mass
shooting in February, when a man open fired on an adult education center, killing
10 people.
Factors like the suspect’s age indicate that the shooting may be connected to
gangs, said Diamant Salihu, an investigative journalist for the Swedish public
service broadcaster, SVT, and the author of two books about gang violence and
criminal networks in Sweden.
“During the past decade, we have seen an escalation of deadly shootings,” Mr.
Salihu said. “More recently, the change is that there are very many young shooters
who do it for payment and status,” he added.
The shooting occurred ahead of the Walpurgis celebrations, where Swedes
celebrate the beginning of spring with public bonfires. The police said there was no
current danger to the public.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/europe/sweden-shooting-

several towns near Jerusalem and call for international assistance on Wednesday

The fires interrupted Israel’s annual memorial day for the country’s fallen, one of
the most hallowed dates on the national calendar. Television broadcasts of solemn
ceremonies in military cemeteries were replaced with footage of Israelis making
their way to safety on foot along a major highway.

canceled because of the expanding fires and inclement weather, including high
winds. The cause of the wildfire was not immediately clear.

service said its medics had treated at least 19 people for light injuries.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement that a combination
of strong wind and dryness had created a “deadly combination,” aggravating the
blazes.
Israel has requested international aid to fight the wildfires, which were still
spreading as of Wednesday evening. Officials had reached out to Britain, France,
Greece, Italy and other countries for assistance, according to the Israeli
government.
The Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West
Bank, offered to help in snuffing out the fires, Hussein al-Sheikh, a senior
Palestinian official, said in a text message. In 2021, Palestinian firefighters joined
Israeli efforts to beat back a similar wildfire near Jerusalem.
Israeli officials did not respond to requests for comment as to whether they would
accept the Palestinian offer.
Mr. Caspi said over the weekend — following a smaller but still intense fire near
Jerusalem — that climate change was likely exacerbating the strength of Israel’s
wildfires.
“This specific fire was advancing at eight meters per second. There has been
nothing like it,” he said at a news conference last weekend. “When we talk about
global warming, this is the reality.”

Julie Turkewitz;Isayen Herrera,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,A Mother and Father Were Deported Under Trump. But What Happened to Their Daughter?,"A Venezuelan family is calling for a 2-year-old to be returned to her mother after
the U.S. authorities deported the mother to Venezuela on Friday without the child.
The girl’s father was sent to a prison in El Salvador in March.
The toddler, Maikelys Antonella Espinoza Bernal, remains in foster care in the
United States, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Officials said in
a statement that the child was removed from her parents and from the manifest of
her mother’s deportation plane for her own “safety and welfare.”
The Trump administration claims the girl’s parents are members of Tren de
Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, but it has not offered evidence to back this up.
The girl, known to many in her family as Antonella, is one of several children who
have been swept up in President Trump’s immigration crackdown in recent days.
At least three children who are U.S. citizens were sent to Honduras this month with
their mothers, decisions protested by the families’ lawyers.
In the case of the Venezuelan toddler, the girl’s mother, Yorely Bernal, 20, had
entered the United States with her partner, Maiker Espinoza, and their child in
May 2024, while President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was still in office.

Happened to Their Toddler?

that Antonella was passed from foster parent to foster
parent, landing in a string of homes in the course of a year.

According to the couple’s relatives, the authorities told them their tattoos looked
suspicious, took them into custody and sent the girl to foster care.
During Mr. Trump’s first administration, family separations at the border drew
anger and legal challenges, and eventually ceased to be used as a blanket policy.
But separations continued to take place in limited instances during the Biden
administration when officials believed there was a threat to the child.
It is unclear why officials separated the family members last year. Record searches
indicate that neither parent has a criminal record in Venezuela or Peru, where they
lived for several years, or in the United States, beyond their immigration offenses.
In the United States the couple has lived only in immigration detention.
In 2022, Mr. Espinoza, now 25, was arrested in Peru on an allegation of domestic
violence, but the case was closed and he never faced trial, according to records.
U.S. officials sent Mr. Espinoza to El Salvador on March 30 on one of five planes
carrying Venezuelan men to a maximum-security prison. The Trump
administration claims that all the Venezuelan men on those flights are members of
Tren de Aragua, but it has provided little proof of this.

In late April, Ms. Bernal called her mother, Raida Inciarte, to tell her that she was
going to be deported back to Venezuela, Ms. Inciarte said in an interview. American
officials had told Ms. Bernal that Antonella would be coming with her, Ms. Inciarte
said.
On the video call, Ms. Bernal showed her mother a document from immigration
authorities bearing Antonella’s name, which she claimed indicated the child would
be leaving the United States with her.
But when Ms. Bernal boarded the deportation flight to Caracas, the Venezuelan
capital, on April 25, her child was not there.
From her home in Maracaibo, Venezuela, Ms. Inciarte called on the American
government to release the child, who she said has lived in four foster homes while
her parents were in immigration detention over the past year. (Ms. Inciarte has
been in touch with a case worker and the foster parents, she said.)
Her daughter, she said, had arrived home in Maracaibo on Sunday, and spent
Monday morning crying in her bedroom.

“That little girl,” she said of the toddler, “has a family that has been suffering every
day for a year.”
The toddler is under the supervision of the Office of Refugee Resettlement,
according to the Department of Homeland Security, referring to a part of the
Department of Health and Human Services. An official at that office referred all
questions to the D.H.S.
The Trump administration did not say when, or if, the child would be reunited with
her family.
In its statement, Homeland Security said Mr. Espinoza was a “lieutenant” of Tren
de Aragua who oversees criminal operations, including a “torture house,” and that
Ms. Bernal directed the “recruitment of young women for drug smuggling and
prostitution.”
“President Trump and Secretary Noem take their responsibility to protect children
seriously,” said the statement, referring to the department’s secretary, Kristi Noem.
“We will not allow this child to be abused and continue to be exposed to criminal
activity that endangers her safety.”
María Alejandra Fernández, 31, Mr. Espinoza’s sister, said: “My brother is not a
criminal. He left Venezuela like many young people, looking for an opportunity to
get ahead.”
A protest last month in Caracas, Venezuela, of family members of Venezuelans deported from the United

The department did not respond to a request for more details about the allegations
of gang connections.
Ms. Inciarte said the toddler’s first foster homes were in the El Paso area. But
Antonella was placed in a new home in recent days, Ms. Inciarte said a foster
mother told her, and now she wasn’t sure where that home was located.
The new foster mother did not respond to messages from The New York Times.
The Trump administration has said that Tren de Aragua has “invaded” the United
States, which the president is using to justify the rapid deportations of hundreds of
Venezuelans and to fulfill a campaign promise to take a hard line against
undocumented immigrants.
Ms. Bernal and Mr. Espinoza fled economic and political crises at home in
Venezuela, their families said, and met while living in Peru. She worked at a fast
food stand. He worked as a bricklayer and in ironwork, until opening a business as
a barber, said his sister, Ms. Fernández, who lives in Venezuela.

Antonella was born in Lima on Feb. 8, 2023, according to her birth certificate,
which lists the couple as her parents. When the girl was 1, Ms. Bernal and Mr.
Espinoza decided to follow a growing flow of migrants to the United States, said
their families.
Salaries in Peru were low, said Ms. Inciarte, and the situation wasn’t improving in
Venezuela.
“They got excited,” she said, “and set out to pursue the American dream.”
The couple left Peru, and — with their child in tow — crossed Ecuador, Colombia,
the Darién jungle, which connects South America with Panama and Central
America. In Mexico, they were briefly kidnapped by what Mr. Espinoza’s sister
described as “coyotes,” or migrant traffickers.
Last May, the families said, the two turned themselves in at the U.S. border.

From detention, Ms. Bernal told her mother in a call that the authorities believed
her tattoos — she has many — made her a “gang member.”
But it wasn’t until Mr. Trump took office, said the families, that the accusations
became more specific: The government believed that they were members of Tren
de Aragua.
Ms. Bernal’s tattoos include her parents’ birth years inscribed on her neck, as well
as a lightning bolt, a small flame and a serpent, her mother said. Mr. Espinoza’s
tattoos include the cartoon characters Yosemite Sam and Marvin the Martian,
according to a statement he gave to the authorities, as well as a cross, a crown and
a compass with a plane.
Internal government documents indicate that the U.S. authorities are citing tattoos
to label people as members of Tren de Aragua, though there is little evidence that
the gang uses tattoos as markers of membership.
In her conversations with the foster parents over the last year, Ms. Inciarte, said
the parents described Antonella as “sweet” and “independent” for a toddler. But
they also noted that the girl cried when she moved among families and seemed
confused about who she belonged to.
This anguished the grandmother, who worried about “psychological damage,” she
said.
“Today she wakes up with one mother,” she said, “tomorrow she has another.”

Andrew E. Kramer,NYT,1,World,5/3/2025,Ukraine Rejects Russian Call for a Three-Day Cease-Fire,"President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday said Ukraine will not adhere to a three-
day cease-fire proposed by Russia, saying such a short truce would not help in
negotiations for a lasting peace.
Ukraine in March accepted a proposal from the Trump administration for a 30-day
cease-fire, to be followed by talks on matters including the location of an armistice
line, steps to safeguard a nuclear power plant occupied by the Russian army and
deployment of a possible European peacekeeping force.
On Saturday Mr. Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv that the Russian counteroffer of a
three-day cease-fire covering the anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe,
an important political holiday in Russia, was merely a “theatrical show.”

He said Russia’s offer was intended to “create a soft atmosphere of an exit from
isolation” for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and to assuage security worries
of foreign leaders and dignitaries attending a Victory Day parade in Moscow on
May 9. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has accepted an invitation to attend the
parade.
“We are simply either at war, or Putin shows he is ready to stop shooting as a first
step to ending the war,” Mr. Zelensky said. Ukraine’s offer of a 30-day truce
remains on the table, he added, saying Ukraine would be willing to start that truce
before the May 9 holiday if Russia accepted it.
The military parade last May in Red Square on Victory Day, celebrating the defeat of Nazi Germany.

Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Kyiv has designed
and manufactured a growing fleet of exploding long-range drones capable of
striking Moscow, and has repeatedly targeted the Russian capital.
Mr. Zelensky said Saturday that Ukraine would offer no safety guarantees to
guests at the Red Square parade on May 9, as Russia has carried on missile strikes
on Ukraine despite visits by foreign leaders to Kyiv. Last week, Ukraine’s military
intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, aired a more direct threat, saying guests to the
parade should “bring earplugs.”
The spokeswoman for Russia’s foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova, responded that
Mr. Zelensky’s comments were a “direct threat” to Russia’s celebration. The deputy
head of Russia’s security council, Dmitri A. Medvedev, threatened retaliation for
any attacks during the anniversary ceremonies, writing in a post on Telegram that,
“in the event of a real provocation on Victory Day, nobody guarantees Kyiv will see
May 10.”
The rejection of Russia’s offer comes as Mr. Zelensky has found himself on
somewhat surer ground with the Trump administration in cease-fire talks, mending
relations after a disastrous Oval Office shouting match in February. He has taken
pains to point out that Ukraine accepted the administration’s proposed cease-fire
followed by substantive talks, while Russia has not.
Though its advances on the battlefield have slowed to a crawl amid staggering
casualties, Russia is still seen as having momentum in the war and would lose
leverage if fighting halted for any significant period.
President Trump last month expressed frustration with Russian foot-dragging in
talks and bombardments of Ukrainian cities that have killed scores of civilians,
posting on social media, “Vladimir STOP!” after a missile strike in Kyiv killed 12
people and wounded dozens.

In his comments on Saturday, Mr. Zelensky praised the change of tone in a meeting
with Mr. Trump on the sidelines of the funeral of Pope Francis last month, calling it
his “best conversation” yet with the American leader.
As the two sat face-to-face on chairs in the Vatican, he said, he had broached a U.S.
resumption of the provision of air defense weapons to Ukraine and suggested that
America impose additional sanctions on Russia. “I won’t speak of the details, but
what he told me sounded strong,” Mr. Zelensky said.
On Thursday, the spokeswoman for the State Department, Tammy K. Bruce, said
the United States would step back as a mediator in the talks, which have yielded
only limited commitments to reduce airstrikes on energy infrastructure and an
earlier, one-day cease-fire on Easter Sunday that both sides accused the other of
violating.
“We certainly will remain committed to it and will help where we can,” Ms. Bruce
said of the search for peace. But, she said, “we are not going to fly around the world
at the drop of a hat to mediate meetings.” The negotiations, she said, would depend
on Russia and Ukraine presenting “concrete ideas about how this conflict is going
to end. It’s going to be up to them.”
On Saturday, Mr. Zelensky suggested the United States would step back after a
cease-fire was achieved. He said that “apparently, after an agreement on a cease-
fire, some countries would like us to remain one-on-one with the Russians.”
In response to a question about the prospect of the Trump administration walking
away from talks, Mr. Zelensky said he expected European nations to play a role.
The Europeans, he said, will “be nearby.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/world/europe/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-talks.html
Constant Méheut,NYT,1,World,4/17/2025,The Ukrainian Schoolmaster Teaching History to His Invaders,"On a recent afternoon in Bila Tserkva, a quiet city in central Ukraine, a 59-year-old
history teacher settled into a colorful cafe, opened a laptop and logged into
Chatroulette, an online platform that connects strangers worldwide.
His goal? To teach Russians, citizens of a nation that has invaded his, a bit of
Ukrainian history.
Within minutes, a middle-aged Russian man appeared on the screen, speaking
from what looked like a grocery store. Vitalii Dribnytsia, the history teacher,
wasted no time, opening with a deliberately provocative question: “Who does
Crimea belong to?” he asked, referring to the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula that
Russia illegally annexed in 2014.
Want to stay updated on what’s happening in Russia and Ukraine? Sign
up for Your Places: Global Update, and we’ll send our latest coverage to
your inbox.
“To us,” the man replied without hesitation.
What followed was a dizzying exchange on the historical roots of Ukraine and
Russia, Ukraine’s war of independence from 1917 to 1921, and the Ukrainian
language. At times, the Russian man hesitated about historical facts, but in the end,
he waved it all away. “The internet will tell you everything,” he said. “Ukraine
never existed and never will.”
This was just one of hundreds of online conversations Mr. Dribnytsia, a former
middle school and high school teacher, has had with random Russians over the past
three years of war, as he seeks to challenge the Kremlin’s narrative that Ukrainian
nationhood is a fiction and, by extension, that Ukraine belongs to Russia.
Almost every day, for several hours at a time, Mr. Dribnytsia engages with
Russians on Chatroulette, using a matter-of-fact tone and sharp questions to try to
debunk widely held beliefs in Russia: that Ukraine as a nation was created by the
Soviet Union, that its leaders are neo-Nazis or that its language is merely a dialect
of Russian.
Videos of Mr. Dribnytsia’s candid discussions, which he uploads to YouTube, have
attracted a huge following in Ukraine. His YouTube channel, called “Vox Veritatis,”
Latin for “The Voice of the Truth,” boasts nearly half a million subscribers, with
Ukrainians watching the conversations to learn more about their own history and
sharpen their arguments in defense of Ukraine’s right to sovereignty.
His exchanges have offered a rare and unusual window into the politicization of
history in Russia, shedding light on the ideological foundations behind Russia’s
attempts to erase Ukraine’s past and identity, including by systematically
destroying Ukrainian cultural sites.
“People usually don’t know their own history. That’s normal. But in this war, in
Russia, it’s not just ignorance — it’s the weaponization of history,” Mr. Dribnytsia
said in a recent interview in Bila Tserkva, his hometown. “I’m just trying to set the
record straight.”
A monument in Kyiv commemorating victims of the Holodomor, a Kremlin-engineered famine that killed

A burly man with a white beard, Mr. Dribnytsia knows from experience how
history can be used as a political tool. He studied history in Kyiv in the final years
that Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, when liberalizing reforms were
beginning to lift the lid on decades of hushed-up historical events.
He still remembers one of his professors describing the Holodomor, the Kremlin-
engineered famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in 1932-33, as “an invention of
Western bourgeois historians” — only for students to later read about the famine in
Pravda, the Communist Party’s official newspaper.
“We entered university as typical Soviet students. But by the time we graduated,
the ideological landscape had completely changed,” said Mr. Dribnytsia, who
graduated with a master’s degree in 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed and
Ukraine declared independence.
He began teaching the same year, using textbooks that had not yet been updated
from Soviet times. Mr. Dribnytsia had to rely on his own research and books
written by little-known reformist historians to present a version of events as
accurate as possible.
“I understood that I had to teach children this new information — the facts that had
either been hidden from us or distorted by Soviet history,” he said.
Former students of Mr. Dribnytsia in Bila Tserkva remember him as a demanding
yet passionate teacher.
“He wanted each of us to know our history because a person can only move
forward and make informed decisions by understanding the past,” said Iryna
Semyhailo, 31, now a math teacher in Bila Tserkva.
Though far from the front lines, the sound of drones streaking toward Kyiv are frequently heard over the
town of Bila Tserkva, and several buildings in the town have been destroyed by drone strikes. Brendan

In 2021, Mr. Dribnytsia retired because of serious health issues. That summer, Mr.
Putin published a 5,300-word essay distorting history to claim that Ukrainians and
Russians are “one people” — an argument he would later use to justify his invasion
as a liberation of Ukraine from the West.
Alarmed by the Kremlin’s propaganda, Mr. Dribnytsia began devoting his time to
engaging in online discussions with Russians about history. But what started as an
attempt at open dialogue quickly evolved into a project focused on debunking
Moscow’s narrative, particularly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022.
Drawing from his teaching skills, Mr. Dribnytsia often peppers his interlocutors
with precise questions and cuts them off to point out factual errors — ultimately
pushing them to confront the inconsistencies in their reasoning.
In a video of a conversation recorded two years ago, seen by 1.7 million people, Mr.
Dribnytsia responds to a man who claims that Russians and Ukrainians are
brothers, echoing Mr. Putin’s argument. “How do you define brotherly nations?”
Mr. Dribnytsia asks.
“From history,” the man replies. “We have a shared past.”
Mr. Dribnytsia is the co-author of this
seventh grade Ukrainian history
textbook.

“If Austrians and Hungarians lived in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, does that
mean Austrians and Hungarians are brothers?” Mr. Dribnytsia snaps back,
pointing to two nations that are now neighbors but speak different languages and
have distinct traditions.
The Russian man then points out that Russia and Ukraine share a common
religion, Christian Orthodoxy. Mr. Dribnytsia responds by noting that about a tenth
of Ukrainians are Greek Catholics, before pressing again: why should Russians and
Ukrainians be considered brothers?
“Maybe I’m mistaken,” the Russian man concedes, “though I don’t think so.”
Since mid-2021, Mr. Dribnytsia has recorded over 1,500 conversations — enough to
plant seeds of doubt in some of his interlocutors, though he often encounters
outright hostility.
By his own admission, he hasn’t had much success changing peoples’ minds. Most
Russians he encounters either dismiss his arguments outright or echo Kremlin
talking points. Only a small minority, usually those who oppose the war, engage in
genuine historical debates, he says.
During a recent online chat, a Russian woman praised Mr. Dribnytsia’s work,
urging him to keep “laying out the facts.” Dimitri, a 27-year-old Russian who
opposes the war, said in a phone interview that the videos had taught him about
events overlooked in Russian textbooks, such as the existence of a Ukrainian state
in the late 1910s.
Over time, Mr. Dribnytsia realized his true audience isn’t Russians, but the millions
of Ukrainians who were educated in Soviet times and now want to update their
knowledge — part of a broader movement in wartime Ukraine to break free from
decades of Soviet and Russian influences.
Mr. Dribnytsia, walking along the banks of the Ros River in Bila Tserkva. “People usually don’t know

Some of his videos, where he discusses the first appearance of Ukraine on world
maps or the complex history of Ukrainian nationalist movements — two topics that
were either ignored or distorted in Soviet textbooks — have garnered over a
million views.
“I’m learning a lot from him,” said Natalia Tylina, a 64-year-old Ukrainian retiree
who described herself as “formed in the Soviet Union.” She said she now feels more
confident to argue with acquaintances who “don’t know our history at all” and
spread Russian narratives.
In his conversations, Mr. Dribnytsia is often asked about the darker chapters of
Ukrainian history, including the collaboration of nationalist movements with the
Nazis during World War II. He doesn’t shy away from the topic, acknowledging
their collaboration while also noting that the Nazis later suppressed those same
groups.
Three years of war and as much time trying to correct historical falsehoods have
taken a toll on Mr. Dribnytsia. He loses his calm more often during online
conversations, and he has come to believe it is futile to try to change the minds of
his Russian interlocutors.
“Most of them go on Chatroulette to target Ukrainians and push their fabricated
narratives,” he said. “They’re not here to hear a different perspective or learn
something new.”
Yaroslav Hrytsak, a prominent Ukrainian historian who has watched Mr.
Dribnytsia’s videos, said his work might seem in vain. But if nobody sets the record
straight, he noted, then “Mr. Putin wins.”
“His efforts actually make perfect sense,” Mr. Hrytsak said. “It’s about restoring
our dignity, proving that Ukraine as a nation exists.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/world/europe/ukraine-history-russian-falsehoods.html
Jin Yu Young,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,South Korea to Use Drones to Deter Birds After Deadly Jeju Air Crash,"South Korea will begin deploying drones at airports in the first half of this year to
help prevent bird strikes, part of an overhaul of aviation safety that was announced
four months after the deadliest aviation disaster in the country.
The government also said it aimed to rebuild some crucial infrastructure at six
airports by the end of the year, devise measures to combat pilot fatigue, and
increase the number of safety supervisors.
On Dec. 29, the pilots of Jeju Air Flight 2216 declared “Mayday” and told air traffic
controllers there had been a bird strike as the plane was descending into Muan
International Airport in the country’s southwest. After making a sharp turn, the jet
landed on its belly, slid down the runway and rammed into a concrete barrier,
exploding into a fireball that killed 179 of the 181 people on board.
Aviation safety experts have suggested that the collision with the barrier — an
antenna array used to guide aircraft during landing called a localizer — may have
contributed to the high death toll. Such concrete localizers like the one in Muan will
South Korea to Use Drones to Deter Birds After
Deadly Air Crash
be replaced with frangible structures that break apart easily, the government said
Wednesday.
Investigators have not identified the reasons for the crash and what role, if any, a
bird strike might have played. But the country’s transport ministry said bird
feathers and blood were found in both of the jet’s engines. An investigation by The
New York Times revealed that officials from the Korea Airports Corporation — a
state-owned company that operates nearly all of the country’s airports — had been
warned for years before the crash about the risks of bird strikes at the airport in
Muan.
The transport ministry said Wednesday it would begin deploying drones at
airports in the first half of this year to prevent birds from approaching. By the end
of next year, it plans to develop drones that can identify birds and release bird
repellents, which will then be rolled out to all of the nation’s airports starting in
2028. Drones are commonly used by airports worldwide to scare away flocks of
birds in a plane’s flight path, experts say.
South Korea’s government had in February already pledged 247 billion won
(around $174 million) over three years to improve bird-strike prevention measures
at all the country’s airports. Those included installing bird-detection devices and
implementing a national radar model that would alert air traffic controllers, safety
staff and pilots to the presence of birds.
The ministry said Wednesday it will begin installing thermal imaging cameras in
June and sound wave generators starting in August. In the statement, it also said it
would add laser guns to deterrent measures and acquire more cars to patrol
airports. Muan International Airport didn’t have many of these tools at the time of
the crash.
Officials from the government and the airport have publicly acknowledged that the
airport’s bird-prevention patrol team was short staffed and lacked sufficient
equipment to keep the birds away from the airport.
On Wednesday, the government also vowed to collaborate with local aviation
offices and the Korea Airports Corporation to prevent birds from flocking to land
surrounding airports, several of which are near marshy wetlands where many
birds roost. Conservationists have criticized flight officials for building airports in
proximity to bird habitats.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/asia/south-korea-jeju-air-

Ruth Maclean,NYT,1,World,5/3/2025,Ghana Wanted a Cathedral. It Got an ‘Expensive Hole’ Instead.,"The walls surrounding Ghana’s national cathedral are aging plywood. Its spires are
yellow construction cranes, which have not moved in years. It frequently
reverberates with singing — the singing of a choir of frogs that moves in whenever
the cathedral’s half-finished foundations fill with rainwater.
Ghana’s former president, Nana Akufo-Addo, spent around $58 million of public
money on the $400 million cathedral project — a huge sum in this debt-saddled
West African country. The new finance minister said in March that Ghana’s
economy was in “severe distress.”
The cathedral was designed by the celebrity architect David Adjaye. But beyond
the blueprints, there is very little to show for the money.
“They have only dug a hole — a big hole,” Praise Chinedu, a student and a
Pentecostal Christian, said last month.

Across Accra, Ghana’s coastal capital, citizens joke that the hole is the biggest and
most expensive in the world. A valuable stretch of land surrounded by museums,
bank headquarters and some of Ghana’s ritziest hotels was cleared of government
buildings for the church. That land is now thick with vegetation and bird life,
unvisited except by scrap metal thieves and, occasionally in the rainy season,
swimmers staging stunts for social media.
By The New York Times
The unbuilt cathedral became a symbol of economic mismanagement and a
political battleground after Mr. Akufo-Addo said that its construction was to fulfill a
personal pledge he had made to God.
Now that Mr. Akufo-Addo has left office, the project appears permanently doomed.
The cathedral is now a major target of the new government’s anticorruption
initiative, called Operation Recover All Loot. Last month, the government
announced it would no longer fund the project and dissolved the agency
responsible for managing it.

especially important to young people, has seen a recent boom in church building.

But the national cathedral project never attracted the support Mr. Akufo-Addo
anticipated. Instead, construction stalled at its foundations as Ghana suffered its
worst economic crisis in a generation.
A church service in Accra last month.
To many Ghanaians lately, a cathedral has seemed like the last thing the country
needs, especially one with an estimated cost of $400 million.
The project began with much fanfare. In 2019, at a fund-raising dinner in
Washington, a smiling Mr. Akufo-Addo cut into a large gray, square confection —
the planned cathedral rendered in cake. With a 5,000-seat auditorium and a
concave roof referencing the curve of Asante royal stools, it was intended to be
much more than just a cathedral. It was to be a national monument, similar to the
Washington National Cathedral or London’s Westminster Abbey. A place where the
solemn ceremonies of state — like presidents’ funerals and royal weddings —
would take place.
Mr. Akufo-Addo, who was born into a Presbyterian family but became an Anglican
as a young man, told the group gathered in Washington that the
interdenominational cathedral would be a unifier for Ghanaian Christians, who
represent more than 70 percent of the population. It would also be an offering of
thanks to God for sparing the country from the epidemics, civil wars and famines
that had plagued its neighbors, he said.
But then he revealed a third reason for its construction.
“I made a pledge to God that if I become the president — after two unsuccessful
attempts — in the 2016 presidential elections, I will build a cathedral to the glory of
God,” he said, according to official readouts of the event.
Former President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana last month in his home office. “I find it difficult to see what
is so problematic about it,” he said of the cathedral project.
The statement turned out to be a gift to Mr. Akufo-Addo’s opponents, who argued
that the president should not be allowed to use public money as part of a personal
bargain he made with God — let alone $58 million of it.
Paul Opoku-Mensah, the executive director of the agency overseeing the project,
said that demonizing the cathedral quickly became “a political strategy.”
In March 2024, one member of Parliament, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, led a march
to the construction site, cutting a red ribbon at its gate to poke fun at the president
for commissioning what was still a giant hole.
“We are demanding that the contracts must be immediately terminated to avoid
further financial loss to the state,” he said.
If using the cathedral to target the president was a political strategy, it worked.
John Mahama, a former president who promised to create jobs and fix the
economy, pulled off a dramatic comeback in December’s election. He made Mr.
Okudzeto Ablakwa his foreign minister.
Corruption accusations often take center stage in Ghanaian elections, and the large
sums involved in the national cathedral project convinced many Ghanaians that
officials had been skimming off the top. A public ombudsman said procurement
rules had been breached and recommended a forensic audit.
But in an interview by the big hole in early April, Mr. Opoku-Mensah said he had
nothing to hide and had handed over all the accounts to the investigators.
A meeting room at the cathedral project site.
He explained that the cathedral was not really intended as a church, but as a major
monument that had needed state money to get started but would eventually
become a profit-making magnet for visitors.
“It’s a fundamental misunderstanding of the vision,” he said.
Mr. Akufo-Addo also seemed befuddled about the controversy. “I find it difficult to
see what is so problematic about it,” he said in an interview in April in his book-
lined home office surrounded by a lush garden. He mused aloud about whether
people believed it “would be too big a tribute to my leadership.”
Now that the country’s leaders have changed, few Ghanaians admit to supporting
the cathedral. Those who do say Mr. Akufo-Addo and others should foot the bill —
but not taxpayers.
“It should be funded through donations,” said Esi Darko, an architect, as she left
church one recent afternoon in an Accra neighborhood known as Christian Village.
“It shouldn’t be imposed upon everyone because not all are Christians.”
There are also around five million Muslims in Ghana, a country of more than 35
million people, and, lately, a growing number of atheists.
“Don’t believe in God?” reads a billboard in central Accra. “You are not alone.”
Lawrence Tetteh, a Ghanaian pastor, delivering a sermon at the Fountain of Life Mission Church in
Accra.
Even prominent Christians have soured on the project. Arriving at the church he
leads on a recent Sunday, one well-known pastor, Lawrence Tetteh, and his sister
Lady Gifty Tetteh, a British Ghanaian barrister, ducked into Mr. Tetteh’s office for
an interview.
He embraced the cathedral project initially, he said. He thought Christians from
different denominations would be brought together by it, just as Ghanaian Muslims
are by the national mosque, built by Turkey in 2021. But when he saw so much state
money being spent, Mr. Tetteh said, he stopped supporting the idea.
“We are a developing nation,” he said. “As much as it’s nice to have an edifice, we
also don’t want a situation where our edifice will eat into the little the nation has to
live on.”
Ms. Tetteh said that God would understand if the president explained that he could
not make good on his cathedral promise. “God is not a hard taskmaster,” she said.
Perhaps, she suggested, the former president could build him a little prayer room
instead.

Ségolène Le Stradic,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,Mosque Killing Puts French View of Muslims Under Scrutiny,"The fatal stabbing of a Muslim worshiper in a mosque in France has prompted
heated criticism of government officials who did not initially treat it as a possible
hate crime or show the degree of concern they had in other fatal attacks.
The victim, Aboubakar Cissé, a 21 year-old from Mali, was stabbed dozens of times
Friday morning while he was praying in a mosque in La Grand-Combe, a small
town in southern France, about 50 miles northwest of Avignon.
The main suspect, who filmed himself standing over the victim, was heard
insulting Allah in the video, which was posted on Snapchat, French news media
reported.
A local prosecutor at first suggested — wrongly, it emerged — that the killing had
stemmed from a dispute between two worshipers. But on Sunday, that prosecutor,
Abdelkrim Grini, said in a TV interview that the killing was being investigated as
an “anti-Muslim act” or “an act with Islamophobic connotations.” Other motives are
being explored, he added, including “a fascination with death, a desire to kill and a
desire to be considered a serial killer.”
A Killing in a Mosque Puts France’s View of
Muslims Under Scrutiny
The suspect fled to Italy before turning himself in on Sunday at a police station in
Pistoia, a small town near Florence, Cécile Gensac, the Nîmes prosecutor, said on
Monday. The suspect was identified as a French national of Bosnian origin, born in
2004, who was previously unknown to the police, but nothing else about him or his
views has been made public.
He has not yet been returned to France, which a prosecutor said could take weeks,
or charged with a crime.
“It’s an Islamophobic crime, it’s an act of terrorism, and today we are afraid,”
Aminata Konaté-Boune, a spokesperson for Mr. Cissé’s Soninke ethnic group, said
at a news conference with the victim’s family on Tuesday. “Tomorrow, what will
happen? Will they come knocking on our doors to kill us? Will there be a hunt for
Muslims?”
The killing happened the day after a girl was stabbed to death at a high school in
Nantes, allegedly by another student who was fascinated with Hitler. The school
attack, which also wounded three others, prompted a strong and swift government
reaction, prompting critics to accuse the government of a double standard.

Bruno Retailleau, France’s conservative interior minister, posted a message on
social media on the day of the attack at the mosque expressing support for the
victim’s family and the Muslim community.
But unlike in Nantes, where he visited the crime scene hours after the attack, he
did not immediately rush to the mosque. Instead, he traveled on Sunday to Alès, a
nearby town, where he met with the local prosecutor and mayors.
President Emmanuel Macron of France did not comment on the attack until
Sunday. “I extend the support of the nation to his family and to our fellow citizens
of the Muslim faith,” he said on social media. “Racism and hatred based on religion
will never have a place in France. Freedom of worship is inviolable.”
Yoro Cissé, the victim’s cousin, told the news agency Agence France-Presse on
Tuesday that no member of the government had contacted his family. “We want to
feel safe; France is a country we love,” he said. “We want to feel like everybody
else.”
Ten percent of France’s population is Muslim, according to a 2023 study by the
National Statistics Institute. Islam has grown, at a time when more people profess
no religious affiliation, to become the country’s second-largest faith.
France, which upholds its own brand of secularism known as “laïcité” —
guaranteeing freedom of conscience and the neutrality of the state and of some
public spaces — has an uneasy relationship with Islam. Muslim clothing like
headscarves and full-length robes have stirred endless debate and various
attempts to ban them.
“The least we can say is that the authorities were slow to react,” to the mosque
killing, said Hakim El Karoui, a Muslim business consultant and the author of the
book “Islam, a French Religion.” “Being on the side of Muslims is not popular when
you are a politician in France.”
About 1,000 people marched silently in La Grand-Combe on Sunday to honor Mr.
Cissé’s memory. But some deplored the absence of politicians, French news media
reported.

Assembly in Paris on Tuesday. Ludovic Marin/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images
Another demonstration was organized the same day at the Place de la République
in Paris at the behest of left-wing politicians and associations.
“This violence is the result of an Islamophobic climate that has been cultivated for
months,” said Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the leftist France Unbowed party,
during the protest. That the interior minister did not rush to visit the mosque was
“incomprehensible,” he added.
On Tuesday, Yaël Braun-Pivet, the president of the National Assembly, held a
minute of silence for Mr. Cissé in the lower house, though she said top lawmakers
had not reached an agreement to do so.
Djibril Cissé, the victim’s uncle, said that he had been shocked by the news
coverage of his nephew’s death and by the reactions of politicians.
“He was a sociable person who was a source of hope for all of us,” he said.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/europe/france-mosque-

Mujib Mashal;Hari Kumar,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,India’s Muslims Fear a Growing Backlash After Kashmir Attack,"Widespread detentions and demolitions of property targeting Muslims in India
have provoked concerns that right-wing Hindu nationalists are exploiting last
week’s terrorist attack in Kashmir to deepen a campaign of oppression against the
country’s largest minority group.
Public anger has swelled after 26 people — all but one of them Hindu tourists —
were killed by militants near the town of Pahalgam in the Indian-administered part
of Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region. India has said that Pakistan had a
supporting hand in the attack, an accusation that Pakistan denies.
India has appeared to be preparing to strike Pakistan militarily in response to the
terrorist attack, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowing to hunt down the
terrorists and “raze” their safe havens. A Pakistani government minister said on
Tuesday that Pakistan believed an Indian strike was imminent.
On Wednesday, Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, urged the United States
to press India to de-escalate tensions and “act responsibly,” the state-run PTV said
on Wednesday, after Mr. Sharif had a phone call with Secretary of State Marco
Rubio.
So far, India’s central government has been focused on carrying out a series of
punitive measures against Pakistan, including threatening to disrupt the flow of
cross-border rivers. But officials and right-wing Hindu groups have intensified
harassment of Muslims, which they have framed as a drive against illegal
migrants.
In several states run by Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, local officials have used
the moment to hound what they call “illegal Bangladeshis” and Rohingya, the
Muslim minority who have fled Myanmar. Such labels, including “Pakistani,” are
often used to target Muslim migrants from other parts of India.
The killings of Muslims were reported in two states, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka,
with media reports suggesting they were hate crimes.
Inside Kashmir, security forces have arrested hundreds as they seek the
perpetrators of the April 22 attack, and they have blown up the homes of people
they have accused of having terrorist affiliations. The sweeps, which has included
the detention of 2,000 people according to one official, resemble the collective
punishments that the authorities have previously carried out after attacks on
security forces in Kashmir.
Kashmiris in other states have reported harassment and violence, with right-wing
groups filming themselves assaulting Kashmiri roadside salesmen and threatening
violence if Kashmiris do not leave.

“The attack in Pahalgam was horrible but should not become a pretext to engage in
reprisals and attacks on minorities, including arbitrary arrests or summary
punishments,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, the deputy Asia director at Human Rights
Watch.
Ms. Ganguly said that “ultranationalist broadcast networks and social media users
have been inciting hate” that has resulted in violence.
The immediate backlash after the terrorist attack was targeted at Kashmiris and
soon spread to a wider anti-Muslim sentiment. That, analysts said, has furthered a
demonization of Muslims that Mr. Modi’s party has long employed to unite India’s
Hindu majority.
In the days after the attack, Kashmiri students studying in cities around India
reported harassment and threats. Kashmir’s top elected official, Omar Abdullah,
sent government ministers to different cities to help “ensure the safety and well-
being” of Kashmiris.
In Uttar Pradesh, a Muslim restaurant worker was shot dead and another injured
on April 23. The attackers, declaring themselves members of a Hindu group,
released a video claiming responsibility and saying “I swear on Mother India that I
will avenge the 26 with 2,600 of them.” (The state’s police, however, said the killing
was related to a dispute over food.)
In Karnataka, another Muslim man was lynched for chanting pro-Pakistan slogans,
according to local news reports.
The most sweeping action has come in Gujarat.
On Monday, the state’s police chief said his officers had arrested 6,500 “suspected
Bangladeshi citizens.” Videos of the detention drive showed the men being moved
through the streets inside cordons of ropes.
In an indication of how indiscriminate the arrests were, the police chief said that
only 450 of the detainees had so far been found to be illegal immigrants from
Bangladesh.
The government in Gujarat also announced a demolition drive at a Muslim slum
near a lake, showing drone footage of bulldozers and dump trucks lined up for an
operation that it said involved more than 2,000 police officers. By Tuesday evening,
the state’s home minister, Harsh Sanghavi, said that about 2,000 huts had been
razed in a drive against “illegal Bangladeshis.”
Harsh Mander, a social activist, said that painting Indian Muslims as
“Bangladeshi” was an old trope used by Mr. Modi’s party.
Court petitions by residents asking for a pause were denied on Tuesday, as the
government had made a national security argument.
The petitioners argued that they were citizens of India with documentation and
had lived in the area for decades. They acknowledged that the demolitions had
taken place in an area the government claimed was public land, but said they had
happened without prior notice or due process.
Petitioners in the Gujarati city of Ahmedabad said that those detained had been
subjected to “custodial violence, atrocities and humiliation,” despite police soon
realizing that “more than 90 percent of those who are detained” were Indian
citizens.
The actions against Muslims, Mr. Mander said, “are all signs of what the state is
doing to use its power and authority in ways that are unlawful and unconstitutional
against a particular community.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/asia/india-muslims-detentions-demolitions.html
Matina Stevis-Gridneff,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,Mark Carney Has to Deliver on Trump and the Economy After Canada Election Win,"Canada’s banker-turned-prime-minister pulled off a political miracle, leading his
party from polling abyss to a rare fourth term in power, and securing the top
government job after entering electoral politics just three months ago.
Mark Carney, the country’s new leader, told Canadians that he was the right person
to stand up to President Trump and that, with his economics expertise, he knew
how to boost the country’s lackluster economy and fortify it in turbulent times.
Now he has to actually do all of that, and quickly, as his country moves from a
prolonged period of political turmoil and faces the fallout of a trade war with its
closest ally and economic  partner: the United States.

Mess at Home
When Mr. Carney’s predecessor, Justin Trudeau, announced in January that he
would resign after 10 years leading Canada, he created a rare opportunity that Mr.
Carney jumped at.
But after Mr. Carney won the race to replace Mr. Trudeau in March as prime
minister and leader of the Liberal Party, he also inherited a messy situation at
home that he must now urgently take on.
The Canadian Parliament has not been in session since before Christmas, after Mr.
Trudeau suspended its activities to be able to hold the Liberal leadership election
that elevated Mr. Carney.
As a result, the country has been in a state of political instability for months with no
ability to pursue a legislative agenda.
And Mr. Carney doesn’t yet have his own cabinet — he made small changes to the
one he inherited from Mr. Trudeau, but he is likely to put his personal stamp on the
government by choosing top ministers now that he’s won the national elections.
Justin Trudeau walks away from a lectern after announcing his intention to resign as

What’s more, the Liberals did not manage to clinch a majority of seats in the House
of Commons and will need to court three members from smaller parties to get their
policies passed in the 343-seat chamber.  
Mr. Carney will need to move swiftly to win the necessary parliamentary allies and
ensure the stability of his party while keeping it from becoming vulnerable to
collapsing through a vote of no confidence, which would trigger new elections.

“The first order of business is getting a cabinet and getting Parliament back as

“We need to see the prime minister come in and quickly move into lawmaking,” Mr.
Holmes said. “There is no honeymoon for this prime minister.”

Stability now
A key pitch to Canadians that worked in Mr. Carney’s favor at the ballot box was
that he was exactly the right leader to navigate the reordering of global trade and
security prompted by Mr. Trump.
Mr. Carney’s past experience leading major institutions through upheaval,
including the Bank of England through Brexit, were key in convincing many
Canadians who backed him that his credentials were aligned for the challenges
Canada faces.
Canadian businesses are looking to Mr. Carney to restore a sense of order to
commerce with the United States. Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Canadian goods have been
a moving target, with the administration pulling back on some levies, while
applying new ones, with no sense of a coherent economic rationale.  The result has
been a halt to private sector investment in Canada, Mr. Holmes said. Mr. Carney
should address that immediately, he said.
“Capital is frozen and paralyzed watching the trade war play out and not knowing
what the future is going to be,” Mr. Holmes said. “He needs to inject certainty in
that.”
Anti-Trump
Mr. Carney’s framing of his campaign around Mr. Trump’s threats to Canada has
elevated him to a global anti-Trump figure. He is the first major leader to be elected
on an explicitly anti-Trump campaign since Mr. Trump’s re-election.
“As I’ve been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our
water,” Mr. Carney told supporters gathered in Ottawa, Canada’s capital, in the
early hours Tuesday to celebrate his victory. “President Trump is trying to break us
so he can own us. That will never happen,” he added as the crowd booed.
Later on Tuesday, the two men spoke by phone, their offices said, and agreed to
meet soon.
Mr. Carney’s fiery rhetoric could prove a problem if the two leaders do talk in
person. Mr. Carney has said he wants to gain Mr. Trump’s respect, while also being
open to discussions about what the future relationship between the two countries
on various issues, including trade and security, will look like.
“There is an appetite in the West to find an anti-Trump figure to take up the mantle
of leader of the free world,” said Stephen Wertheim, a senior fellow at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace. “I think that’s a hazardous proposition.”
“The minute the media starts hyping a foreign leader as the hand of global anti-
Trump resistance, that will put a target on that leader’s back,” Mr. Wertheim added. 
Mr. Carney is likely to strike a more nuanced tone behind closed doors with Mr.
Trump, but the Canadian public will be looking for the defiance and pride that he
promised on the campaign trail.
And the fact remains that the United States has imposed tariffs on key Canadian
sectors, like the auto industry, and that Mr. Trump continues to regularly say he
wants Canada to become the 51st state, including on Canada’s Election Day.
Mr. Wertheim said Mr. Carney should ignore the threats and focus on striking a
deal. “I think Carney shouldn’t get too fixated on the annexation threat,” he said. “If
Trump makes one, it will probably be half a joke, and Carney should dish it right
back and smile.”
Playing Host
An early test of Mr. Carney’s ability to manage dealing with Mr. Trump will take
place when he hosts the summit of the Group of 7 industrialized economies leaders
in Kananaskis, Alberta, in June.
Mr. Trump is expected to attend, and will find himself among America’s closest
allies, all of whom have been hit with U.S. tariffs.
Mr. Carney, on the contrary, will be among friends, in his own backyard. He has a
personal relationship with President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime
Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, and is seeking to negotiate a military spending  
deal with Ursula von der Leyen, the top European Union official.
It is unclear what, if anything, will be decided at the summit since global
gatherings like these tend to be about coordinating policy at a higher level rather
than yielding anything specific.
Still, there is a small margin for error. The last time Mr. Trump attended a G7
summit in Canada, he had a blowup with Mr. Trudeau, left without signing an
anodyne joint communiqué, and then called Mr. Trudeau “two-faced.”
Mr. Carney will need to closely stage-manage the event to try to prevent any
unpleasantries.
“The G7 leaders’ summit in June will really shape the early assessment of his
success,” Mr. Holmes said. “This is what he campaigned on, that he can handle a
very complex geopolitical international situation.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/canada/canada-election-carney-trump.html
Jonathan Wolfe;José Bautista,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,Power Outage in Spain and Portugal Creates a Day of Confusion,"Rocio Vilaplana, a dentist in southeastern Spain, was closing a suture in a patient’s
mouth during oral surgery early Monday afternoon when the lights went out.
“Everything started beeping,” Ms. Vilaplana said.
Her backup generator kicked in, the emergency lights in her surgery room
flickered on and the 36-year-old dentist tried to remain calm. “Let’s just close it
properly,” she thought to herself.
Dr. Vilaplana finished the delicate procedure, but it would be the beginning of a day
of frayed nerves and widespread confusion across Spain and Portugal, as a daylong
power outage brought life to a standstill for tens of millions. People spent the night
in train stations huddled under blankets, stuck in their apartments without water
or working elevators, staring at their suddenly useless cellphones and wondering
what had happened.
With electricity almost entirely restored in the two countries — though the
authorities in Spain and Portugal were still searching for the cause of the outage —
many people reflected on the anxiety of being left not only without power, but also
Stuck in a Dentist’s Chair, and Other Blackout

without cellphone service, internet access or the ability to pay for anything except
with cash.
In Murcia, a city in southeastern Spain, the word on many residents’ lips on
Tuesday was “locura” — insanity.
“The worst was the lack of communication,” said María José Egea, 71, who spent a
nervous evening in her seventh-floor apartment, the elevator out of service.
Neighbors came to check in on her, she said, although good information was scarce
and rumors about the cause of the blackout flew.

Madrid. Oscar Del Pozo/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images
“People were coming and telling me nonsense,” she said. “Everyone had a theory. ”
In the Spanish capital, Madrid, residents in the Arganzuela neighborhood filtered
into the streets on Monday, confused by what was happening. Some stared at their
unconnected phones.  Others gathered outside health centers, shops and bars to
try to gather information.
A small crowd collected at an auto repair shop on Martín de Vargas Street, where
the owner, Fernando Palacio, opened the doors of a car he was working on and
played a news broadcast on the radio — the only reliable source of information
throughout the day.
It reminded Mr. Palacio of a 1981 coup attempt in Spain, he said Tuesday morning,
with “everyone glued to the radio.”
Naturally, people flocked to the stores that were still open to buy batteries, cooking
charcoal, toilet paper and other essentials. By nightfall, some store shelves in cities
like Murcia were empty.
“We were actually quite scared,” said María Cantero, 41, a restaurant server in
Archena, about 15 miles outside Murcia. She made a run to the store to buy formula
for her 5-month-old daughter and candles. As night fell and the power was still out,
she felt uneasy.
In Peniche, Portugal, about 60 miles north of Lisbon, José Boto, a 69-year-old
pensioner, had a tough day.
He was standing in line at a supermarket, holding a chicken — his lunch — when
he was told there had been a power outage and that payment could only be made in
cash. “I had to leave the chicken behind,” he said.

By Tuesday morning, life was regaining its rhythms. Ms. Cantero drove her
daughter, Lucía, to a doctor’s appointment in Murcia. The traffic lights were
working again, and the police officers who had deployed to intersections to direct
traffic a day earlier were gone.
The Spanish capital was not quite back to its bustling self. Many residents
appeared to be staying home. Schools were open, although few were holding
regular classes.
María del Carmen Sánchez, a caretaker at Cervantes Secondary School in the
Lavapiés neighborhood of Madrid, said that “barely 5 percent of the students”
showed up on Tuesday.
Still, she said, despite “the chaos of the situation, I think everything went quite
well. People were very patient, although there were some nerves and concern at
first.”
For others, the disruptions of the previous day lingered.
Anthony Saas, 24, a student from Zgharta, Lebanon, was stranded in the southern
Spanish city of Córdoba on Monday after his train home to Jaén, where he is
studying, was canceled. He spent a sleepless night at the train station, covered by a
Red Cross blanket, and he was still there on Tuesday morning, holding a plastic bag
with his belongings and waiting for his rescheduled train home to be announced.
“It was a tough night,” Mr. Saas said. It was his first visit to Córdoba, he added,
“and I don’t even know if I will ever come back.”
As the authorities continued to search for the cause of the blackout, many across
the region prepared for several days of digging out.
At her dental clinic in Murcia, Dr. Vilaplana donned her scrubs and mask again on
Tuesday morning. She was planning to work up to 13 hours to try to fit in all of her
canceled patients and attend to new emergencies.
For the next few days, she said, “it’s going to be completely crazy.”

Matina Stevis-Gridneff,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,Canada Election Results: Mark Carney and the Liberal Party Fall Short of Majority,"Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada and his Liberal Party narrowly failed to
win a majority of seats in Parliament in Monday’s election, and will need help from
smaller parties to pass legislation and pursue a challenging agenda, including
confronting President Trump’s economic and sovereignty threats.
With final results coming in on Tuesday from nearly all districts a day after polls
closed, the Liberals secured 169 seats in the 343-member Parliament, just three shy
of a majority, according to Elections Canada, the independent body that manages
the country’s elections. The Conservative Party won 144 seats.
The result was still a resounding success for a Liberal Party that three months ago
was predicted to lose badly to the Conservative opposition and for Mr. Carney, who
had never run for any elected office before Monday. It grants the Liberals a rare
fourth consecutive term in government.
Canada’s Liberals Narrowly Miss Out on
Majority in Parliament

While a majority government would have allowed Mr. Carney to push through his
policies without needing to rely on others in Parliament, the task of securing
support from other members to pass laws and budgets did not appear too taxing —
the Liberals have governed without a majority over two terms, for the last 5 and ½
years. Small parties like the Greens and the leftist New Democrats are more
naturally aligned with the Liberals’ center-left political platform.
The Conservative Party had been handily leading in polls until March when Mr.
Trump’s tariffs on Canadian goods took effect and Mr. Carney replaced Justin
Trudeau as prime minister and the leader of the Liberals. For the Conservative
leader, Pierre Poilievre, the party’s stinging defeat was made worse by the fact that
he lost his seat, which he had held for 20 years, to a Liberal candidate.
Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative leader, on Monday night. He lost his own seat in the House of

The election has been extraordinary in many ways, with candidates and many
voters describing it as the most critical vote in their lifetimes.
It was dominated by Mr. Trump and his relentless focus on Canada, America’s
closest ally and trading partner. He imposed tariffs on Canadian goods, including
autos, steel and aluminum, pushing the country toward a recession, and repeatedly
threatened to annex it as the 51st state. Even as Canadians were heading to the
polls on Monday, he repeated his argument on social media that making Canada
part of the United States would yield economic and military benefits.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Carney spoke Tuesday by phone, Mr. Carney’s office said in a
brief statement, adding that they would meet “in the near future.”
“President Trump congratulated Prime Minister Carney on his recent election,” the
statement said. “The leaders agreed on the importance of Canada and the United
States working together — as independent, sovereign nations — for their mutual
betterment.”
Mr. Carney, 60, a seasoned economist and policymaker who promoted himself as
the anti-Trump candidate and centered his campaign on dealing with the United
States, ultimately benefited from the American president’s actions.
Now, he is likely to be judged on how he fares in defending Canada from the
damage, including significant job losses and the hobbling of major industries, that a
prolonged trade war could cause.
In his acceptance speech early on Tuesday, Mr. Carney warned Canadians that
there would be difficult times ahead, even as he made clear that he was prepared to
protect Canada’s interests in his dealings with Mr. Trump.
“As I’ve been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our
water,” he said. “President Trump is trying to break us so he can own us. That will
never happen.”
Mr. Poilievre, 45, and the Conservatives had been dominating polls for years,
building their support around the argument that Mr. Trudeau and the Liberals had
dragged Canada into chronic economic malaise.
But they watched their double-digit lead rapidly disappear after Mr. Trump
launched his aggressive campaign against Canada and Mr. Trudeau, who had been
deeply unpopular, resigned.
Canadians heading to the polls were preoccupied both with the country’s
relationship with its neighbor to the south and with the state of the economy at
home. Affordability worries, primarily over housing, were top of mind, opinion
surveys conducted before the election showed, and seemed to boost Conservative
candidates in some districts.
But Canada’s election choice on Monday also served as a referendum of sorts on
Mr. Trump and the way he has been treating America’s allies and its trading
partners.
It was the second major international election since Mr. Trump came to power,
after Germany’s, and Canada’s handling of the rupture in the relationship with the
United States is being closely watched around the world.
The election also highlighted that Mr. Trump’s brand of politics can turn toxic for
conservatives elsewhere if they are seen as being too in sync with his ideological
and rhetorical style.
Mr. Poilievre’s repeated denunciations of “radical woke ideology” and promises to
defund Canada’s national broadcaster and cut foreign aid seemed to have cost him
centrist voters, pre-election polls suggested.
The party’s defeat and Mr. Poilievre’s loss of his own seat could set off a battle for
the Conservative leadership, though the party won more seats and a larger share
of the vote than it had in years.
For Mr. Carney, the victory marked the astonishing culmination of his rapid rise in
Canada’s political establishment since entering the race to replace Mr. Trudeau in
January.
A political novice but policy-making veteran, Mr. Carney, a former central banker,
conveyed a measured, serious tone and defiance toward Mr. Trump’s belligerence,
helping to sway many voters who had been contemplating supporting the
Conservatives, according to polls and some individual voters.
And his politics as a pragmatist and a centrist seemed to better align with Canada’s
mood after a decade of Mr. Trudeau’s progressive agenda.
In the early hours of Tuesday, amid celebrations, Mr. Carney said he was ready for
the challenge. “We will fight back with everything we have to get the best deal for
Canada,” he said. “We will build an independent future for our great country.”

In December, Mr. Colamedici’s press printed 70 copies of an Italian edition that he
supposedly translated. Still, the book quickly gained outsize attention, being
covered by media outlets in Germany, Spain, Italy and France, and being cited by
tech luminaries.
“Hypnocracy” describes how powerful people use technology to shape perception
with “hypnotic narratives,” putting the public in a kind of collective trance that may
be exacerbated by relying on A.I.
The book’s publication came as schools, businesses, governments and internet
users all over the world are wrestling with how to use — and not use — A.I. tools,
which tech giants and startups have made widely available. (The New York Times
has sued OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and its partner, Microsoft, claiming
copyright infringement of news content. The two companies have denied the suit’s
claims.)
Yet the book turned out to also be a demonstration of its thesis, playing out on
unwitting readers.
The book, Mr. Colamedici said, was meant to show the dangers of “cognitive
apathy” that could develop if thinking were delegated to machines and if people
don’t cultivate their discernment.
“I tried to create a performance, an experience that is not just the book,” he said.
Mr. Colamedici teaches what he calls “the art of prompting,” or how to ask A.I.
smart questions and give it actionable instructions, at the European Institute of
Design in Rome. He said that he often sees two extreme, if opposite, responses to
tools like ChatGPT, with many students wanting to rely on them exclusively and
many teachers thinking that A.I. is inherently wrong. He instead tries to teach
users how to discern fact from fabrication and how to engage with the tools
productively.
The book is an extension of this effort, Mr. Colamedici argued. The A.I. tools he
used helped him to refine the ideas, while clues (real and invented) about the fake
author (online and in the book), intentionally suggested potential problems to
prompt readers to ask questions, he said.
The first chapter discusses fake authorship, for example, and the book contains
obscure references to Italian culture unlikely to come from a young philosopher
from Hong Kong, which eventually helped to lead one reviewer to the true author
operating as a translator.
Sabina Minardi, an editor at the Italian outlet L’Espresso, picked up on the clues,
exposing Jianwei Xun as a fake early this month.
Mr. Colamedici then updated the fake author’s bio page and spoke to publications,
including some deceived by his work. New editions and excerpts printed this
month come with postscripts about the truth.
But some who first embraced the book now reject it and question whether Mr.
Colamedici has acted unethically or broken a European Union law about the use of
A.I.
The French news outlet Le Figaro wrote about “L’affaire Jianwei Xun,” explaining
that the “problem” with its earlier interview of the Hong Kong philosopher was that
“he doesn’t exist.”
The Spanish newspaper El País in Spain retracted a report about the book,
replacing it with a note that said “the book failed to acknowledge A.I.’s involvement
in the creation of the text, a violation of the new European AI Act.”
Article 50 of that law says that if someone uses an A.I. system to generate text for
the purposes of “informing the public on matters of public interest,” then it must
(with limited exceptions) be disclosed that generative A.I. was used, said Noah
Feldman, a law professor at Harvard University who advises tech companies.
“That provision on its face seems to cover the creator of the book and perhaps
anyone republishing its content,” he said. “The law does not go into effect until
August 2026 but it is common in the E.U. for people and institutions to want to
follow laws that seem morally good even when they don’t yet technically apply.”
Jonathan Zittrain, a law and computer science professor at Harvard, said he was
more inclined to call Mr. Colamedici’s book “a piece of performance art, or simply
marketing, that involved using a pen name.”
Mr. Colamedici is disappointed some initial champions have decried the
experiment. But he plans to keep using A.I. to demonstrate the very dangers it
raises. “This is the moment,” he said. “We are risking cognition. It’s use it or lose it.”
He said he plans to have Jianwei Xun — describing it as a collective of humans and
artificial intelligence — teach a course about A.I. next fall.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/europe/hypnocracy-ai-

Aurelien Breeden,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,French Lawmakers Cracking Down on Drug Traffickers,"French lawmakers on Tuesday widely approved a bill that cracks down on illegal
drug trafficking by empowering prosecutors, toughening the penalties for
traffickers and giving the police more investigative tools.
The move, which paves the way for the measures to become law, was a rare case of
successful policymaking in France’s lower house of Parliament, the National
Assembly. Lawmakers there have been hobbled by political fractures, but they
have joined to express growing concern over the far-reaching impact of crime and
violence tied to the drug trade.
The National Assembly approved the bill with 396 votes in favor and 68 against. Its
passage was a win for the government of Prime Minister François Bayrou, who
survived a no-confidence motion in February to pass a budget but who is still at the
mercy of the divided lower house.
“Everyone knows the current political difficulties: no majority in the National
Assembly, a complicated path for major bills,” Bruno Retailleau, France’s interior
minister, a conservative who championed the bill, told lawmakers on Tuesday.
Mr. Retailleau said that the broad support for the bill showed that lawmakers
understood that drug trafficking and organized crime were “often the root cause of
hyper-violence” in France and an “existential threat” against its institutions.
Some left-wing lawmakers expressed concern about the focus on cracking down
against drug traffickers, rather than the root causes of their trade, but only the
hard-left France Unbowed party ultimately voted against the bill. Green
lawmakers and a handful of others abstained.
Impetus for the new bill came from an alarming Senate Committee report on drug
trafficking that was published last year. It was spearheaded by a Socialist and a
member of the conservative Republican Party in a rare instance of collaboration
across the aisle.
“The impact of drug trafficking on France has exploded over the past decade,” the
report warned. It said that the police were now seizing 10 times as much cocaine as
they were a decade ago and that France’s overall drug trade was estimated to be at
least 3.5 billion euros, or nearly $4 billion.
Just last week, the police seized a 9.1-metric ton shipment of cannabis resin near
Lyon, the Paris prosecutor’s office announced on Tuesday
Shooting and arson attacks on French prisons this month have also heightened a
sense that the French authorities are facing an uphill battle against violent crime.
The justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, has suggested that the attacks were carried
out by drug traffickers to “intimidate” the state, although the identity of those
responsible is not yet clear.
The linchpin of France’s new drug trafficking measures, which were inspired in
part by Italy’s anti-mafia efforts, is the creation a national prosecutor’s office
dedicated to coordinating organized crime cases  It is expected to be operational by
2026, and will focus on the most complex and prominent drug-trafficking
investigations.
The bill alsomakes it easier to seize the assets of drug traffickers, and allows the
police to document some information about investigations — like how a wiretap
was conducted — in separate case files that are not accessible to the lawyers of
drug-trafficking suspects. That change is intended to avoid leaks that could
endanger the lives of investigators or informants, but it has infuriated defense
lawyers, who say it violates the right to a fair trial.
The bill also drastically toughens the treatment of inmates regarded as particularly
dangerous. It creates special high-security units for the most prominent drug
traffickers to minimize outside contact, banning some family visits and using more
videoconferencing to reduce the number of in-person court hearings.
Some of the measures seemed tailor-made for one of France’s most notorious
criminals, Mohamed Amra. who was freed last year in a ruthless ambush on a
prison convoy that left two guards dead on a major highway.
The attack shocked the country and focused attention on violence tied to the drug
trade. Mr. Amra, who was taken back into custody in Romania in February after a
nine-month manhunt, had juggled cellphones from behind bars to run schemes that
included drug trafficking and kidnappings, raising uncomfortable questions about
whether the authorities had underestimated him.
The rare critics of the bill just passed in Parliament argued that several of its
measures were redundant and that the measure did not give the police the funding
needed to tackle complex and time-consuming drug investigations.
“We still believe that this bill will be, for the most part, inefficient,” Ugo Bernalicis,
a France Unbowed lawmaker, told the lower house on Tuesday.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/europe/french-lawmakers-

James Wagner,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,"No Evidence of Cremations at Mexican Ranch, Attorney General Says","An abandoned ranch in western Mexico that groups searching for missing relatives
had claimed was an “extermination camp” — because of discarded personal items
and burned remains found there — was a training hub for a major cartel, Mexico’s
attorney general announced on Tuesday. But, he said “there is not a single piece of
evidence to prove” that the ranch was the site of human cremations.
At a news conference presenting his office’s findings so far in the high-profile case,
Attorney General Alejandro Gertz said that the Izaguirre ranch in Teuchitlán, a
village near Guadalajara in Jalisco state, was “totally proven” to have been used as
a recruitment, training and operations center by the Jalisco New Generation
Cartel, one of the most violent criminal organizations in the country. He said that
conclusion was based on testimonials and documents.
But in a departure from previous comments, Mr. Gertz insisted that there was no
proof of cremations at the ranch.
Mr. Gertz said a container of very small bone fragments was found by the
authorities who originally discovered the ranch in September. He said that studies
conducted by a Mexico City university on evidence, dirt and other materials did not
find heat levels over 200 degrees Celsius. Cremations, he said, require levels in
excess of 800 degrees.
Earlier this month, Mr. Gertz said that investigators had not found evidence of
crematories at the ranch, but that some human remains found there had “traces of
some type of cremation.” And Mexico’s security minister, Omar García Harfuch,
said last month that, based on a detained person’s testimony, the cartel went as far
as killing those who resisted training or tried to escape.

On Tuesday, Mr. Gertz said that, beyond the one body found by the authorities in
September, when the National Guard exchanged fire with people at the ranch,
investigators had not found more bodies or bones.
The ditches and holes in the ground — which a search group had believed to be
cremation ovens — were bonfires, Mr. Gertz said.
Héctor Flores, a leader of a search group in Jalisco state, said in a phone interview
that search groups still believed that the ranch had been an extermination site and
that people had been cremated there given what they found last month. He said
that officials were using technical language in an effort to change the narrative.
“The government can call it whatever it wants, but I think Mexican society is
mature enough and aware of this whole Izaguirre topic to not believe the lies of the
federal government,” he said.
Mr. Gertz said that authorities had no idea how many people may have been
recruited or disappeared at the ranch. He said the forensic team was still studying
the bone fragments to identify them, a task that has been complicated by their
small size.
Multiple times on Tuesday, Mr. Gertz reminded the public that the investigation
was ongoing and that his office has only had control of the case since late March,
when President Claudia Sheinbaum asked him to take over.
After a group of volunteers searching for their missing relatives received a tip in
early March about a possible mass grave hidden in western Mexico, photos of
heaps of shoes and clothes shocked a country already scarred by many episodes of
brutal violence and clandestine graves.
More than 120,000 people have gone missing in Mexico since the country began
keeping track in 1962, according to official data. More than 15,000 have gone
missing in the state of Jalisco, with many of the cases believed to be linked to the
Jalisco New Generation Cartel.
Last month, Mr. Gertz criticized the investigation carried out by local authorities
and said it had been riddled with irregularities. Local officials failed to secure the
site after it was first located in September, and it was abandoned until the search
group came along last month.
On Tuesday, Mr. Gertz said that a state human rights commission in Jalisco told
local authorities in 2021 of illicit activities at the ranch “but they did nothing.”
Among the 14 people currently detained in connection with the case, Mr. Gertz said
there are three local police officers, including a police chief, as well as a person
whom the authorities have identified as a cartel leader who oversaw the training
center.
“We’re going to go after those who were covering up or participating in” the cartel’s
operations at the ranch, Mr. Gertz said, noting that this included public officials. He
also said that his office was investigating other possible “narco-ranches” in the
area.
As far as the bags of clothes that were found at the ranch — but that have not been
studied by local authorities — Mr. Gertz said that he did not know whom they
belonged to. But he said that federal investigators planned to work with search
groups to help identify the items and then perhaps link them to their owners
through forensic tests.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/americas/mexico-

Jason Horowitz;Patricia Mazzei,NYT,1,World,5/3/2025,"Cardinal Parolin, Leader of Papal Conclave, Is Also a Top Candidate","In the days surrounding Pope Francis’ death, Cardinal Pietro Parolin was
everywhere.
The No. 2 figure in the Vatican, he visited Francis in the hospital, and then helped
seal the papal apartments after the pope died. He welcomed cardinals he knew
from around the world to the pope’s funeral, talking to former President Joseph R.
Biden Jr., President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and former Prime Minister
Matteo Renzi of Italy. And leading up to the conclave to pick the next pope, he
celebrated an outdoor Mass for tens of thousands of faithful on the steps of St.
Peter’s Basilica.

It seems that everyone knows Cardinal Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state, who
will preside over the papal election and who has emerged as the leading
compromise candidate before a conclave in which many of the more than 130
cardinals do not know one another.
“The only candidate that for now has emerged with a certain insistence is Parolin,”
said Andrea Riccardi, the founder of the Sant’Egidio Community, a Catholic group
close to Francis. “He represents a continuity,” added Mr. Riccardi, who is close to
several cardinals who are considered papal contenders. “He has said, ‘Virtue
stands in the middle.’”
A quiet, plodding Italian with a famously inscrutable poker face, Cardinal Parolin is
deeply cautious. But at a time of global upheaval, that is not necessarily a
disqualifier. Even his backers grant that he lacks Francis’ charisma and global
symbolism — but as the leader of the Vatican machinery for the past decade, he
enacted Francis’ vision.

Square in Vatican City after Pope Francis’ death. Damien Meyer/Agence France-Presse — Getty

Cardinals have talked about Cardinal Parolin as someone who could have a steady,
bureaucratic hand on the church’s wheel. And at 70, he could appeal to cardinals
who do not want to be stuck too long with the winner.
His critics on the left question his past comments about same-sex marriage, which
he called a “defeat for humanity,” and his lack of pastoral experience. His critics on
the right criticize his role in the church’s efforts to make inroads in China, which
has required negotiations with Communist leaders.
But few prelates who know him have strong feelings about him either way. And
after the eventful and, for some, divisive dozen years under Francis, bland but
competent may be just what the cardinals are looking for.
On migration, for example, whereas Francis excoriated the inhumanity of great
powers turning the Mediterranean into a graveyard, Cardinal Parolin said after a
meeting with Italy’s right-wing prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, that immigration
was “a very, very complex subject.”
Some have drawn parallels to the conclave of 1939. With authoritarianism rising
and the world order endangered, those cardinals elected Eugenio Pacelli, a Vatican
secretary of state who had served as envoy to Germany in the 1920s during the
Nazis’ rise. Historians are still divided over whether he, as Pius XII, took an overly
diplomatic approach.
And within the church, some liberal Catholics have questioned whether a measured
bureaucrat without deep pastoral experience is what the church needs to keep
Francis’ inclusive momentum going.

was rising. Agence France-Presse — Getty Images
Cardinal Parolin grew up in Schiavon, a small town in the northern Italian region of
Veneto that is known as a cradle of popes.
He was raised by his mother, an elementary school teacher, after his father, who
owned a hardware store, died in a car accident when the boy was 10.
He entered the minor seminary at 14 and was ordained at 25. But Cardinal Parolin’s
career was not on the path of being a pastor, or a diocesan priest. He entered the
Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in Rome, which trains priests to serve in the
diplomatic corps.
In the 1980s, he was stationed in Nigeria during military coups and a civil war.
Later, he worked in Mexico to restore diplomatic ties. In 1992, he returned to the
Vatican, where he joined the powerful Secretariat of State and served on the Italy
desk. He later became the director of the Villa Nazareth school for promising
students with poor backgrounds, forming connections to young people who would
later join Italy’s elite.
But he also acquired baggage on the way.
In 2002, under John Paul II, Cardinal Parolin became the Vatican’s second most
important diplomat, focusing on Vietnam, where he helped normalize relations, and
on China, which for many in the church is the great challenge of the coming
century.
In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI tried reconciliation with China, which required its
bishops to be loyal to the country’s government rather than to Rome. He chose
Cardinal Parolin, who was then an archbishop, to lead the talks over bishops in
state-sanctioned churches. The talks stalled.
In 2009, Benedict gave Cardinal Parolin another difficult assignment, as the
Vatican’s ambassador to Venezuela, where prelates were in a tense standoff with
Hugo Chávez’s leftist government.
Cardinal Parolin said after meeting with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy that
immigration was “a very, very complex subject.” Andrew Medichini/Associated Press
The cardinal’s charge in Venezuela was more political than theological, and he
employed a style that he would later call “positive neutrality” to press church
interests without taking sides between the government and the opposition.
Venezuelans credited Cardinal Parolin — who speaks English, French and near-
fluent Spanish with a slight Italian lilt — with easing tensions between the
government and the church. It helped that his approach to diplomacy was rather
deliberate and discreet, his supporters have said.
His diplomatic focus under Francis extended to the war in Ukraine and relations
with Russia and the United States. But China was again a major agenda item as
Francis tried anew to improve relations.
Cardinal Parolin helped strike a groundbreaking deal in 2018 that amounted to the
first formal recognition of the pope’s authority within the church in China.
Conservatives considered it a betrayal for Francis to recognize bishops appointed
by the Chinese government who had been previously excommunicated. Sharing
any church authority, conservatives argued, created dangerous conditions for the
millions of Chinese Catholics who worshiped in underground churches loyal to the
pope.
But Francis, and Cardinal Parolin, said it was worth it.
The church had an “attitude of hope, openness and dialogue that we want to
continue on both sides,” Cardinal Parolin said in 2023. All the church asked from
China, he said, was that “Catholics can be Catholics.”
Perhaps the ultimate sign of Cardinal Parolin’s strength headed into the conclave is
an apparent effort to stop him.
American right-wing Catholic publications reported in the days before the papal
election that he had fainted during one of the general congregation meetings. The
incident never occurred, said Matteo Bruni, the Vatican spokesman.
“It’s not true,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/world/europe/pope-conclave-cardinal-pietro-parolin.html
Mark Landler,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,King Charles Issues Message of Support to Fellow Cancer Patients,"King Charles III said on Wednesday that his life with cancer had brought “into
sharp focus the very best of humanity” as he expressed gratitude to medical staff
and charities that work with cancer patients across Britain.
His reflections, delivered in the form of a written message to guests attending a
reception for cancer care charities at Buckingham Palace, opened a small window
into his experiences as a patient, although he did not give any update on his
condition.
The king announced in February 2024 that he had received a diagnosis that he had
an undisclosed form of cancer, and he has been undergoing weekly treatments
since then.
“Each diagnosis, each new case, will be a daunting and at times frightening
experience for those individuals and their loved ones,” the monarch said in his
statement.
“But as one among those statistics myself, I can vouch for the fact that it can also
be an experience that brings into sharp focus the very best of humanity.”
Charles, 76, has soldiered through his illness with no public complaint and very
little discussion. And while he has spoken in elegiac tones about the time he has left
on the throne, he has offered no guidance about how long that might be.
He said that his diagnosis had given him “an even deeper appreciation of the
extraordinary work” undertaken by the charities and individuals attending the
palace reception on Wednesday night, which included Macmillan Cancer Support
and a children’s hospice.
He had visited many of the organizations in previous years, he said, in his role as a
royal patron. “And it has reinforced what I have long observed during these visits
— that the darkest moments of illness can be illuminated by the greatest
compassion,” he added.
Worries about Charles flared last month when he was briefly hospitalized after
suffering side effects from his treatment. The palace characterized it as the “most
minor bump in a road that is very much heading in the right direction.”
The king has returned to an active schedule in recent months, including regular
foreign and domestic travel. This month, Charles and his wife, Queen Camilla, flew
to Rome for a four-day state visit to Italy, during which the king gave a well-
received address to the Italian Parliament, sprinkled liberally with Italian phrases.
The couple also paid an unexpected visit to Pope Francis at the Vatican, just 13
days before he died.
Charles’s reticence about discussing his illness or treatment is in contrast to his
daughter-in-law, Catherine, the Princess of Wales, who confirmed that she, too, had
been diagnosed with cancer a year ago in a recorded video.
Although she has not disclosed what kind of cancer she had, she marked the end of
her chemotherapy treatment in September with a highly personal video that
offered home-movie-style glimpses of her with her husband, Prince William, and
their three children.
Charles ended his message by recalling the words of Deborah James, a British
podcaster and writer who chronicled her struggle with bowel cancer and
campaigned for better awareness of the illness, and who died in 2022.
The king said that for those people receiving the news of a diagnosis “today,
tomorrow or at any point in the future,” he could “only echo” the words of Ms.
James, whose parents were attending the reception.
“Find a life worth enjoying,” he said, quoting Ms. James. “Take risks; love deeply;
have no regrets; and always, always have rebellious hope.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/europe/king-charles-cancer-

Vivian Wang,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,A U.S. Businessman Is Sentenced to 5 Years in Prison in China,"A Chinese-born American businessman was sentenced last week to five years in
prison in China, on charges related to a criminal case nearly 25 years ago, despite
having frequently made routine trips in and out of the country after the fact.
The businessman’s family, as well as a longtime human rights activist, say the case
is an example of the arbitrary nature of law enforcement in China. They have urged
the Chinese government to release the businessman, David Lee, on humanitarian
parole, noting that he had been hospitalized for 10 days and that they believed he
had suffered a stroke.
Mr. Lee’s sentencing on April 23 came as tensions between the United States and
China were at their highest point in years, inflamed by President Trump’s tariffs.
There were no signs that the case was related to the tensions, but it could add
another source of friction to the relationship.
Mr. Lee was found guilty of intentional injury and “picking quarrels and provoking
trouble,” a vague charge that China often uses against people it perceives as a
threat to social stability. In the written verdict, the judge said that Mr. Lee, 61, had
been involved in three altercations in 2000 and 2001, one of which led to a man’s
death.
But the family of Mr. Lee, who held a green card at the time and became an
American citizen in 2002, said his role in those incidents was minor. He was briefly
detained then released without charges, and he assumed the case was closed, his
wife, Louise Lin, said. Over the next two decades, he traveled to China nearly every
month for his work as a wholesale lighting supplier for Home Depot.
Mr. Lee sometimes spent months at a time in China with no issue, Ms. Lin said. “If
you know you’re in trouble, of course you’re not going to go back,” said Ms. Lin,
who lives in California.
He often returned to Hebei Province, where he grew up. That was also where he
was abruptly arrested in the elevator bank of his hotel last April, while going to
breakfast with Ms. Lin, she said. She said she did not know why Mr. Lee was being
targeted.
Ms. Lin has not been able to see her husband since he was detained, except for
once briefly when he appeared in court, she said. But she had heard from
representatives of the United States Embassy, who were allowed to visit him, that
he was in poor health and appeared to have lost around 50 pounds.
John Kamm, the founder of the Dui Hua Foundation, a California-based
organization that works to free political prisoners in China, said that Mr. Lee should
have been released on humanitarian grounds, as China has done in the past, when
a person is at risk of dying.
He argued that the sentence was too heavy, and reflected the “appalling state of
U.S.-China relations.” He noted that Mr. Lee was arrested while the White House
and the Chinese government were negotiating the releases of other American
prisoners.
Reached by phone, the judge in the case, Lin Sen, declined to comment. The
Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The United
States Embassy in Beijing declined to comment.
The main incident in the case took place in March 2001, in Mr. Lee’s hometown,
Baoding, in Hebei. According to the indictment, Mr. Lee, after learning of a
business dispute involving an acquaintance, drove three people to the site of the
dispute, where they began fighting with another group, using knives taken from
the trunk of Mr. Lee’s car. One of the men in the opposing group was stabbed and
died. Then Mr. Lee and his acquaintances drove away.
The people whom Mr. Lee drove were sentenced to prison. Mr. Lee, according to
the verdict, said that he had not gotten out of the car. Other witnesses said the
same.
In the United States, people convicted of driving getaway cars have been charged
with murder and received prison sentences ranging from a few years to life.
The judge in China said he sentenced Mr. Lee more lightly because he was an
accessory rather than a direct participant in the violence. Ms. Lin acknowledged
that, since her husband had driven the car, she would have accepted a short prison
sentence. But she thought five years was excessive.
The police detained Mr. Lee after the fight, but prosecutors did not authorize his
formal arrest, the verdict said. He was “released on guarantee,” a form of bail.
(Under Chinese law, criminal suspects must be released after 35 days if
investigators have not gathered enough evidence to press charges. But the
investigation can remain open.)
About a month later, Mr. Lee flew to the United States.
The court accused Mr. Lee of jumping bail, but Ms. Lin said that her husband had
not been aware of any travel restrictions. She noted that he had not been formally
arrested, and that he started returning regularly to China around 2004 or 2005,
without incident.
His lawyers have filed an appeal.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/american-businessman-

Stephen Castle,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,U.K. Joins U.S. in Strike Against Houthis in Yemen,"Britain’s military carried out a joint operation with U.S. forces against the Houthi
militia in Yemen, officials said on Wednesday, in the first such strike since
President Trump re-entered the White House and stepped up attacks on the Iran-
backed group.
There was no immediate comment from the American military about the operation,
which the British Defense Ministry said early Wednesday was carried out
overnight “to degrade Houthi capabilities and prevent further attacks against U.K.
and international shipping.”
Typhoon jets using precision guided bombs took part in the mission, the ministry
said in a statement, adding that the strike took place “after dark” to minimize the
risk to civilians. The target was “a cluster of buildings, used by the Houthis to
manufacture drones of the type used to attack ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of
Aden, located some 15 miles south of Sana,” the statement added, referring to the
Yemeni capital.
Britain Joins U.S. in Strike Against Houthis in
Yemen
Speaking in Parliament, the British defense secretary, John Healey, said that the
planned targets “were all successfully hit and we have seen no evidence of civilian
casualties.”
The joint operation on Tuesday came after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used
the unclassified Signal messaging app to post sensitive details about a U.S. mission
in Yemen, raising questions about operational security and whether American
allies would be deterred from further participation.
On Wednesday, Helen Maguire, who speaks for Britain’s centrist Liberal
Democrats on defense issues, asked for assurances that security was not
compromised by the United States. Mr. Healey answered, “Our own U.K.
intelligence, our own U.K. communications systems remain secure.”
In leaked Signal messages, Mr. Hegseth strongly criticized European nations,
describing them as “freeloading” and “pathetic.” At the time, Mr. Healey
characterized the comments as a “challenge” rather than an insult, adding that on
military spending “the Americans have got a case.”  
Since the fall of 2023, the Houthis have repeatedly attacked commercial and naval
ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in a campaign that they say is in
solidarity with Palestinians under bombardment in Gaza.
Britain had taken part in joint strikes on Houthi targets ordered under President
Joseph R. Biden Jr., which began in January 2024. Mr. Healey said that Tuesday’s
operation was the first time the British had struck the group’s positions since May
of last year.
In March, Mr. Trump ordered an intensified campaign, which U.S. officials have
called “Operation Rough Rider.” American forces have since then struck more than
800 targets, the U.S. military said on Sunday.
On Wednesday Mr. Healey said that Britain was with its “closest security ally,”  at a
time when the United States was stepping up its military activities in the Red Sea.
He argued that disruption to global shipping caused by the Houthis was damaging

Andrew E. Kramer,NYT,1,World,5/2/2025,Life in Ukraine Has Become More Dangerous Since Cease-Fire Talks Began,"With the beginning of cease-fire talks in the war between Russia and Ukraine, life
has become riskier for Ukrainian civilians, according to a tally of civilian deaths by
the United Nations and analysts reviewing recent Russian strikes.
Since the talks began in February, Russian missile and drone strikes and fighting
along the front line have killed far more civilians than over the same period a year
ago, U.N. officials said in a presentation for diplomats in New York this week. In the
first 24 days of April, for example, 848 civilians were killed or wounded, a 46
percent increase over the same period last year, the U.N. said.
At the same time, Russia has been targeting cities more intensively — just last
month hitting a playground, pedestrians on a crowded sidewalk and an apartment
building — an analysis of recent strikes shows. In the fighting on the ground,

Has Become More Dangerous, U.N. Says

Russia opened a new offensive in the north, east and south, Ukraine’s top military
commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, said on April 9.
On March 11, Ukraine launched on Moscow its largest drone assault of the entire
war — the morning of the day it agreed to a cease-fire. The barrage killed three
people and wounded 18 others in the Russian capital and nearby, the Russian
authorities said.
Overall, the first months of this year coinciding with the Trump administration’s
peace talks have clocked in as far deadlier than the same period last year,
according to the United Nations.

Analysts say an increase in violence during cease-fire talks is not unusual in wars.
When talks are underway in conflicts, they say, warring armies tend to jockey for
advantage before a truce halts the fighting. The result can be more casualties,
particularly in Ukraine as flurries of strikes overwhelm air defenses.
“If there is going to be a moment when they cannot pursue military action, you
expect armies to get in whatever blows they want before they have to stop,”
Samuel Charap, a Russia analyst at the RAND Corporation, said in a phone
interview. “I don’t think an increase in attacks necessarily means rejection of the
negotiating process.”
In 2014 and 2015, Russia escalated military action sharply in Ukraine before or
during cease-fire talks, capturing the eastern towns of Ilovaisk and Debaltseve to
force political terms on Kyiv. “There are things militaries want to achieve before a
potential cessation of hostilities,” Mr. Charap said.
The new run of attacks has put Ukrainians on edge. Olena Khirkovska, 57, an
accountant whose apartment was destroyed in a Russian missile strike in Kyiv on
April 24, said the strikes seemed intended to frighten Ukrainians into accepting an
unfavorable deal.
“We are strong, fear us,” was the message of the attacks, she said, adding, “It feels
like they don’t want peace at all” while engaging in negotiations.
President Trump began the cease-fire talks on Feb. 12 with phone calls to President
Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Since
then, the Trump administration has pursued separate rounds of negotiations with
Ukrainian and Russian officials.
During talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11, Ukraine agreed to the U.S.
proposal for an unconditional, 30-day cease-fire. Later in March, Russia and
Ukraine agreed to a limited truce covering strikes on energy infrastructure, but
each accused the other of violating that.
Emergency workers clearing rubble and searching for victims at the site of a Russian missile strike in

Russia offered a 30-hour cease-fire on Easter Sunday, and Ukraine accepted. Again,
each side accused the other of violations but acknowledged that violence declined
during the truce.
Mr. Putin has proposed a three-day cease-fire next week for the 80th anniversary
of the end of World War II.
Vice President JD Vance in an interview on Thursday with Fox News suggested a
drawn-out timeline for talks stretching into the summer. The war, Mr. Vance said,
would not end “any time soon.” Russia and Ukraine, he said, had laid out their
terms for a settlement. “We’re going to work very hard over the next 100 days to
try to bring these guys together,” Mr. Vance said.
The pace of Russian missile and drone attacks rose after Mr. Trump’s phone call in
February with the two leaders, an analysis of Ukrainian air force reports shows. In
the 30 days that followed the calls, Russia launched 4,694 missiles and drones at
Ukraine, compared with 1,873 in the 30 days before the calls.
After the bombardment of Kyiv that pancaked an apartment building, Mr. Trump
wrote in a social media post of Mr. Putin, “it makes me think that maybe he doesn’t
want to stop the war.”
It is not clear that the increase in attacks is linked to the talks. Russia has for
months been ramping up exploding drone assaults after a factory producing the
most common model, an Iranian-designed drone called a Shahed, came online last
year, said Mark F. Cancian, a senior analyst at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington. “That’s a reflection primarily of availability,”
he said. “They fire everything they have.”
But there was a change in Russian tactics, analysts said. Rather than striking
multiple targets throughout Ukraine, it has focused many nights on one intensive
bombardment of a single city or town.

Radislav, who was killed three days earlier when a Russian ballistic missile struck near a playground in

That tactic overwhelms Ukrainian air defenses and “results in much greater
destruction and human casualties,” said Oleksiy Melnyk, a military analyst at the
Razumkov Center, a research organization, in Kyiv. The goal, he said, is to stir
opposition to the war in Ukraine and raise “pressure on the Ukrainian
government” to accept settlement terms.
The U.N. documented more than 2,641 civilians killed or wounded in the first three
months of this year, Joyce Msuya, the U.N. assistant secretary general for
humanitarian affairs, told diplomats at the United Nations on Tuesday. That was
nearly 900 additional dead and wounded civilians in Ukraine compared with the
same period last year, she said.
The rate of civilian deaths rose further in April, coinciding with a period when U.S.
negotiators met separately with Ukrainian and Russian officials for talks.
The attacks this year have also driven about 40,000 Ukrainians from their homes,
adding to the war’s total of 10.7 million people displaced within the country.
The attacks in April included a strike that killed 35 people, many out strolling on
sidewalks on Palm Sunday in the northeastern city of Sumy, and another that killed
19, including nine children, when a missile hit a playground in the central Ukrainian
city of Kryvyi Rih.
An official in Russia’s occupation government on Thursday accused Ukraine of
hitting a market in a Russian-controlled area of Ukraine, killing seven people and
wounding 20 others. Ukraine’s military denied the claim, which was not possible to
independently verify.
The barrages continued overnight Friday. Ukrainian authorities said that Russia
launched 150 drones overnight, and that most had been shot down. A drone volley
Thursday wounded 14 people in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, the regional
governor said. On Wednesday, a volley of drones wounded 45 people, including two
children and a pregnant woman, in Kharkiv, the local authorities said.
“And so it goes every day,” Mr. Zelensky wrote on Facebook about the attacks. He
asked for nations supporting Ukraine to impose additional sanctions on Russia. “It
must be pressure, not just words or persuasion, that forces Russia to cease fire,” he
said.

Vivian Nereim;Eric Lipton,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,New Mideast Project Is Latest Trump Company Deal Tied to Foreign Government,"The Trump Organization has agreed to a new Middle East golf course and real
estate deal that involves a Qatari government-owned firm, two weeks before
President Trump is set to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates on a state visit.
The project in Qatar, a key U.S. ally and home to a major American military base, is
a partnership with Qatari Diar, a real estate company established by the country’s
sovereign wealth fund and chaired by a government minister.
New Mideast Project Is Latest Trump Company
Deal Tied to a Foreign Government

Eric Trump, the president’s son who runs the family business, traveled to the
Middle East this week to attend a cryptocurrency conference and promote the
company’s real estate developments, which include a separate Trump-branded
tower in Dubai, the largest city in the Emirates.
The two projects will also involve Dar Global, the international subsidiary of the
private Saudi real estate firm Dar Al Arkan, which is leading the project and has
close ties to the Saudi government. The Qatar project was initially reported by
Reuters.
The Trump golf course in Qatar is the most recent in a series of projects that
directly involve foreign governments. And it is just one of a growing list of ways
that the Trump family is profiting from Mr. Trump’s refreshed status after his
return to the White House, including two cryptocurrency ventures.
In Oman, the Trump family has partnered on a Dar Global hotel and golf project
that is being built on state-owned land, and the government will get a share of the
revenues generated, according to company documents. In Serbia, the Trump
family is planning a new hotel in collaboration with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s
son-in-law.
During Mr. Trump’s first term, the family held off signing international deals while
he was in office. In January, before Mr. Trump was inaugurated as president for a
second time, the Trump Organization issued a formal ethics statement that it would
have “no new transactions with foreign governments” but would pursue
international deals.
Eric Trump said in a statement on Wednesday that his family continued to honor
this pledge, as Dar Global had purchased the land from the Qatari government
entity.
“Our partners Dar purchased land from them,” Mr. Trump said, after he appeared
at a signing event with Dar Global and representatives from the Qatari
government. “We have zero relationship with them — they are there showing me
the vision of the city.”
But the Trump Organization has accelerated its international real estate deal-
making in the months since the elder Mr. Trump was re-elected, including a new
development in Vietnam.
Few places exemplify the Trump family’s fluid melding of business with politics as
clearly as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the Emirates, the three countries in the Gulf that
Mr. Trump will visit.
Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed, the deputy ruler of Abu Dhabi and the national security
adviser of the Emirates, also oversees a vast business empire and chairs G42, one
of the region’s leading artificial intelligence firms. In Qatar, the energy minister
heads its state energy company.
In Saudi Arabia, nearly every major business has ties to the state, either via
government-owned stakes in the companies or extensive government contracts.
The president will arrive in the region on May 13 and bypass the Middle East’s
traditional power centers, such as Egypt, in favor of three financial centers that
collectively manage trillions in assets via their sovereign wealth funds.
In 2017, Mr. Trump made Saudi Arabia his first foreign destination as president.
When he left office, the kingdom became a key source of new business for his
family. LIV Golf, a professional league backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund
and rival to the PGA Tour, has hosted tournaments at the Trump National Doral
Golf Club near Miami. The wealth fund has also invested $2 billion in an
investment firm that Mr. Kushner set up after he left his post as a White House
adviser during the president’s first term.
The president has said he wants to bring in $1 trillion in investment to the United
States from his trip to Saudi Arabia. But economists say that is unlikely as the
kingdom faces a cash crunch.

region. Amr Alfiky/Reuters
Dubai, where a new 80-story Trump International Hotel and Tower will overlook
the world’s tallest skyscraper, is a “developer’s playground,” Eric Trump said in an
interview on Tuesday with CNBC.
“We’re going to come in here and build a crown jewel and everybody is going to
know, that’s Trump International Hotel and Tower,” he said. “That’s Trump.”
The project will also allow purchasers to use cryptocurrency to buy properties, he
said at a Dar Global event in Dubai this week. World Liberty Financial, the Trump
family’s cryptocurrency firm, has recently negotiated deals with firms in the
region. These include the Emirates-based DWF Labs, which recently became one
of the largest known holders of the World Liberty token after investing $25 million
in the firm.
In recent years, amid slow global growth and high interest rates, state-backed
entities in the Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been some of the few reliable
sources of capital. In March, the Emirati government pledged to invest $1.4 trillion
in the United States over a decade. This week, Phil Murphy, the Democratic
governor of New Jersey, began a trip to Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and Bahrain,
seeking investment.
In most of the Trump Organization’s foreign deals, the company’s partners put up
the capital to construct the hotels, towers or golf courses. The Trump family is
effectively selling its name and brand, and typically plays a long-term role in
managing the properties.
The Trump Organization is paid a branding fee up front and annual payments
afterward for the foreign branding deals and management fees that collectively are
worth about $10 million a year, according to a 2024 financial disclosure. Mr. Trump
has turned over management of his companies to his sons, but he still benefits
financially from these foreign projects.
Zephyr Teachout, a professor of corporate and anticorruption law at Fordham Law
School in New York, was part of a team that sued Mr. Trump during his first term
for allegedly taking improper financial payments from foreign governments. The
lawsuit, which Mr. Trump’s lawyers challenged, was deemed moot by the Supreme
Court after Mr. Trump’s first term ended and before the case was decided. It has
not been refiled.
Ms. Teachout said Mr. Trump’s latest actions are even more worrisome. “It is
extremely troubling,” she said. “The Qatari government military and trade
decisions are now unavoidably a part of the broader private negotiation over a real
estate deal.”
The Qatari government did not respond to a request for comment. Qatari Diar did
not respond to calls made to its headquarters after business hours but wrote on
social media that it had partnered with Dar Global to launch Trump International
Golf Club & Villas in an oceanfront area called Simaisma. The project would offer “a
new standard of luxury living with an 18-hole golf course, exclusive clubhouse and
beachfront Trump-branded villas,” it said.
Eric Trump told The New York Times after attending a signing event for the new
deal that the golf course and villas would be “beautiful” and “right on the ocean.”
His father’s business relationships in the Gulf predate his political career. Hussain
Sajwani, the founder and chairman of DAMAC Properties of Dubai, built the first
Trump-branded golf course in the Middle East a decade ago.
The Trump family’s ties to the region have deepened since he entered politics, with
the Trump Organization announcing three real estate projects with Dar Global in
the Saudi cities of Jeddah and Riyadh last year.
The Trump Tower in Dubai will include a Trump-branded members-only club and
“the highest outdoor pool in the world,” Dar Global and the Trump Organization
said in a news release on Wednesday.
Eric Trump used his visit to Dubai to trumpet his family’s ties to the emirate and
the region. “On behalf of myself, on behalf of my family, we love Dubai, we love the
Gulf,” he said at the Dar Global event. “We have such a great relationship between
the United States and just one of the greatest places. And I’m proud to call so many
of you friends.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/middleeast/trump-family-

Vivian Yee;Hwaida Saad,NYT,1,World,5/3/2025,Druse in Syrian Town Rocked by Violence Agree to Disarm Militias,"Sirens blaring, a truckful of armed men trailing in its wake, the black sport utility
vehicle that sliced sharklike through the Syrian town of Ashrafieh Sahnaya on
Friday morning was impossible to miss.
Government forces had retaken control from the armed groups that turned the
town into a sectarian battlefield for two days this week, killing dozens and exposing
for all to see the new Syrian leaders’ shaky grip on security. Now, government
representatives had arrived to pledge peace to a skeptical town.
In an airy, echoing religious meeting hall, two officials in suits sat shoulder to
shoulder with white-bearded leaders of the Druse religious minority in traditional
red-topped white hats, talking of unity.
“We’re all in one ship,” said Jameel Mudawwar, the area’s top official. “If it sinks,
God forbid, we’ll all sink.”
The words were not new, but this time they came with action.
Syria’s main Druse militias, who control a strategic swath of southern Syria near
Israel, have resisted a push by the new Islamist government to be folded into the
national military, fearing that acceding would endanger their people.
After this week’s bloodshed, Druse leaders in Ashrafieh Sahnaya agreed to integrate
militia fighters into government forces. But some residents remain wary.
‘We’re All in One Ship’: But as the bloodshed mounted this week, local Druse leaders in Ashrafieh Sahnaya
went the other way. In exchange for government concessions, including promises
to investigate abuses committed during the clashes, they agreed to surrender their
weapons and integrate some fighters into the government’s forces.
Druse and government officials meeting in Ashrafieh Sahnaya on Friday.
“We should love each other, and we should all stand with each other,” the town’s 86-
year-old chief Druse religious leader, Sheikh Abu Rabih Haj Ali, said at Friday’s
meeting. “We don’t want to carry weapons. We don’t want to be against the state.”
It was what the government had hoped to hear for months now, after rebels from
Syria’s Sunni Muslim majority overthrew the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad in
December. But many Syrians from the country’s many religious and ethnic
minorities remain wary of their new leaders amid repeated spasms of violence
targeting minorities, including the Druse.
This week, a debunked audio clip purporting to be of a Druse cleric insulting the
Prophet Muhammad incited Sunni extremists to attack Druse, including in
Ashrafieh Sahnaya, south of Damascus, the capital. At least 101 people were killed,
including government forces, Druse fighters and civilians, according to the Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor.
In Ashrafieh Sahnaya, where different sects have long coexisted peacefully,
mortars and shells crashed into buildings. Drones struck from the sky, and
residents cowered indoors as local Druse militia fighters battled government forces
and armed Sunni extremists.
The rebel coalition that toppled Mr. al-Assad included some Islamist extremist
factions that remain outside central control, and that the Syrian authorities have
shown little capacity to rein in.
Israel, whose government is close to the Israeli Druse minority, then intervened in
the name of protecting Syrian Druse, launching airstrikes on Syrian government
targets.

There are more than one million Druse across the Middle East, mostly in Syria and
Lebanon, and some in Jordan and Israel. They practice a secretive offshoot of
Islam.
By Friday, the bloodshed still seemed more raw wound than memory for many.
One man at Friday’s meeting demanded government reassurances about security
and safety. Dispensing with the conciliatory tone of the others present, he accused
pro-government forces of slaughtering civilians.
The officials at the meeting pleaded for patience.
“We are promising you a better life,” said Mr. Mudawwar, the government official.
“What happens to you will happen to us. It’s the government’s duty to protect
everyone.”
Some listeners bought it.
Saleh Makiki, Mr. Haj Ali’s nephew, said he had lost five relatives this week,
including his father, a son and an uncle. Yet he said he was willing to move forward.
“We should love each other, and we should all stand with each other,” said Sheikh Abu
Rabih Haj Ali, an 86-year-old Druse religious leader in Syria.
“Mistakes happened, but we have assurances now,” he said. The government later
released 32 local men detained during the clashes, satisfying a key Druse demand.
Outside the meeting hall, however, opinions were divided.
Across the street, Bahira Haj Ali, 42, leaned out her window to watch the sheikh, a
relative, departing.
“It’s good we had the men to resist,” she said of the local Druse militias. “You can’t
imagine the sounds we heard — shells, drones.” It was hard to trust government
forces, she said, though, she added, she might feel different if men from Ashrafieh
Sahnaya joined.
As for Druse militias’ weapons, Ms. Haj Ali said: “This is our security. It shouldn’t
be given up.”
In town, there was disagreement over how the violence had begun.
Pro-government protests followed Israeli attacks on Syria on Friday.
Some Sunnis said that Druse militants had attacked government checkpoints after
extremists attacked a nearby town, while some Druse said that Sunni extremists
had struck first.
Around the town square, broken glass and bullet casings littered the ground.
Dozens of young men marched into the square after Friday prayers ended at a
nearby mosque, waving the flag of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Sunni former rebel
group that took power in December.
“One, one, one,” they chanted. “The Syrian people are one.”
But more often, it was their sect, not their country, that they emphasized.
“These are the Sunni,” they chanted. “The Prophet Muhammad is our eternal
leader.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/world/middleeast/syria-druse-sectarian-violence.html
Lizzie Dearden,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,U.K. Crossbow Attack Suspect Voiced Racist and Misogynist Views,"A man accused of wounding two women with a crossbow in the British city of
Leeds on Saturday has died of a self-inflicted injury, the police said on Tuesday.
The suspect, Owen Lawrence, 38, died in the hospital where he was taken after his
arrest at the scene of the attack, the counterterrorism police said in a statement.
The two women, ages 19 and 31, were seriously injured, the authorities said. One
was released from the hospital a day after the attack, but the other remained
hospitalized on Tuesday after undergoing surgery for life-threatening wounds, they
said.
The police said they were still investigating the motivation for the rampage, during
which witnesses saw the suspect walking along a three-mile stretch of pubs and
bars, known locally as the “Otley Run,” armed with a crossbow and several air
rifles.
The attack appeared to be the latest in a series of violent incidents in Britain in
recent years by individuals appearing to harbor a complex mix of motivations.
Some showed an interest in extremist content online, though they did not adhere to
a single ideology.
Last summer, three young girls were brutally murdered in a stabbing attack by a
violence-obsessed teenager in Southport. A prosecutor said in court that the
suspect had no political or religious ideology and that his “only purpose was to kill.”
The young man had viewed a large quantity of videos and material relating to
mass murder, violence and genocide, the authorities say.
Experts in  radicalization have warned of a rise in indiscriminate acts of violence of
a sort once mostly associated with ideologically driven terrorists.
A social media account associated with the suspect in the Leeds attack on the
weekend indicated an interest in mass shootings and in white supremacy, and
voiced misogynistic views.
The authorities have not yet decided whether to formally declare the incident a
terrorist attack. Under British law, that would require a finding that the violence
have been waged “for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or
ideological cause.”
Investigators are reviewing two Facebook accounts that the police believe
belonged to the suspect. One of the accounts was viewed by The New York Times
before it was taken down.
The most recent post, published shortly before the attack began at 2:45 p.m. on
Saturday, was titled “attack information” and contained photos of weapons that
matched images of items discarded on the ground following the assault.  It said the
targets would be “students, night club goers, pub crawlers, Otley Run participants,
society, humanity, humanitarian race, neurotypicals and police, if I need to.”
Under the heading “attack type,” the post said it was a “spree killing, mass murder,
terrorism, revenge, misogynistic rage, homicide/suicide.”
The Facebook user said he was a political “reactionary” who had “explored far
right ideas” and had read a notorious manifesto shared by the white supremacist
who carried out mass shootings at two New Zealand mosques in 2019. A separate
post referred to “the great replacement,”  a far-right conspiracy theory that white
people are being replaced by nonwhites in Western countries.
Another recurring theme on the account was a hatred of women, feminists and the
political left. A Feb. 15 post accused women of causing society to “degenerate” by
choosing the wrong partners. A week later, another post claimed that dating apps
like Tinder were “designed for women only.”
The Facebook account had been made public before the attack and the profile
picture showed a man believed to be the suspect holding a baseball bat and
wearing a T-shirt similar to one worn by one of the perpetrators of the 1999
Columbine High School massacre.
Mass shootings in America also drew attention on the account.
In 2024 the user shared a video relating to a 2017 gunman at a supermarket in
Pennsylvania, with the caption: “R.I.P. brother, identified with you a lot.”
Other attacks discussed on the Facebook page included one targeting Jews and
Muslims in Germany in 2019 and the 2011 Norway massacre by the white
supremacist Anders Breivik.
Several posts alluded to the Crusades, using the Latin phrase “Deus vult” — “God
wills it” — which was used by Christian armies and has since been adopted by far-
right groups. In November 2023, the man posted a photo of himself performing
what appears to be a Nazi salute.
But on Feb. 20 this year, the same account wrote that he did not identify with far-
right ideologies and had only “flirted with their ideas a bit.”
Several other posts  account made reference to health and well-being, saying he
was a recovering drug addict who attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/europe/uk-crossbow-attack-

Ian Austen,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,"Pierre Poilievre Raised Canada’s Conservative Party, Only to Be Tossed From His Seat","When protesting truckers rolled toward downtown Ottawa and proceeded to
occupy the Canadian capital for four weeks, they got a welcome from a man waving
to them from a highway overpass, his hands covered in knitted red mittens with
white maple leaves on the palms.
The man was Pierre Poilievre, who would become the leader of the Conservative
Party and who until just recently was widely referred to as Canada’s next prime
minister. Soon he will have a new title: ex-Member of Parliament.
In a stunning upset, voters in Mr. Poilievre’s district (or riding, as it is known in
Canada) turned him out of office on Monday. His embrace of the so-called Freedom
Convoy of 2022, appears to have played a significant role in the defeat.
Voters in this part of Canada have memories of that time — and not fond ones.
Canada’s Conservative Leader Is Tossed From
His Own Seat

With Ottawa paralyzed, local businesses forced to shut down and residents
struggling to sleep amid the round-the-clock air horn blasting, Mr. Poilievre
brought coffee and doughnuts to the truckers, who were protesting pandemic
restrictions and the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
On Tuesday, his support for the convoy, some leaders of which recently received
criminal convictions, was a recurring complaint among voters in his district,
Carleton.
“Populist politics is not for me,” declared one voter, Rick Pauloski, who said he had
supported Conservatives in the past.
The trucker protest was not the only explanation Canadians offered for the
candidate’s defeat.
Some said they did not trust Mr. Poilievre to deal effectively with President
Trump’s trade war with Canada and his vows to annex it as the 51st state, given his
echoing of the American president’s language. Mr. Poilievre, too, has condemned
“radical woke ideology” and also promised to shrink government, cut foreign aid
and in effect eliminate public broadcasting.
Others said they had grown tired of Mr. Poilievre’s style of attack politics, which he
took to a level not previously seen in Canada. “Canada is broken,” he would tell
voters — at least until Mr. Trump’s threats set off a wave of Canadian patriotism.
Some voters also said that as he rose to power, Mr. Poilievre neglected his local
constituency.
Mr. Pauloski said he was put off by Mr. Poilievre’s embrace of vaccine opposition,
which set off the truckers protest. “The fact that he has an anti-vaccine campaign
really bothered me, because I’m a research scientist,” he said.
Even some who in the end voted for Mr. Poilievre said they had moments of doubt.
Ever since his first run for the Canadian Parliament in 2004, Megan Johnson, a
lifelong Conservative, voted for him. But during the truckers’ siege of the capital, it
began to feel like too much.
“After he went all in for the trucker convoy, I said: I’m never voting for him again,”
Ms. Johnson recalled while out on a small tractor to do yard work on her seven-
acre property. “It really ticked me off.”
Ultimately Ms. Johnson couldn’t bring herself to vote for the Liberal Party and
planted a sign for Mr. Poilievre outside her home.
Signage on the ground at the constituency office of Mr. Poilievre, after he lost the

Voters in Canada do not cast ballots for the prime minister directly, only for local
members of Parliament. And while the Liberals performed the best in this week’s
elections, the Conservatives, notwithstanding Mr. Poilievre’s defeat, received their
highest share of the popular vote since 1988, gaining seats in the House of
Commons.
Mr. Poilievre’s loss came at the hands of a retired businessman and political novice
running on the Liberal Party line named Bruce Fanjoy.
Mr. Fanjoy started campaigning in 2023, an unusually long lead time for anyone
running for Canada’s Parliament. That year and the next the Liberals began a
dramatic plummet in polls that eventually left them nearly 30 percent points
behind Mr. Poilievre’s Conservatives. Voters blamed Mr. Trudeau, the Liberal who
stepped down as prime minister early this year, for inflation, interest rate increases
and upwardly spiraling house prices.
“There were times in the past two years when I was canvassing and it felt like I
had the wind in my face,” Mr. Fanjoy said. But after Mr. Trudeau stepped down and
was replaced by Mark Carney, the former central banker of Canada and England, it
got a lot easier.
In his district, there was little obvious sympathy on Tuesday for Mr. Poilievre.
In a shopping center parking lot in Manotick, one of the larger villages in the
constituency, Marilyn Schacht noted that around town Mr. Poilievre “seemed to be
well liked — until he wasn’t.”
She voted for him on Monday as did her husband, Ryan. Both said they thought
that Mr. Poilievre’s style was what Canada needed during its current economic and
political crisis.
“People were comparing him to Trump all the time, and the man you want to fight
Trump should be a Trump-like guy,” Mr. Schacht said. “You want Churchill to fight
against Hitler, you don’t want Chamberlain. I think we’ve got Chamberlain now.”
By Tuesday morning, Mr. Poilievre’s campaign office, on the top floor of a building
with signs for a church and a martial arts school in downtown Manotick, had
largely been emptied. A volunteer said that no one was available to comment
before closing the door.

During his concession speech early Tuesday morning, Mr. Poilievre vowed to stay
on as Conservative leader. The party’s caucus removed its two previous leaders
following election losses. It is not clear if that will be the case for a third time.
There has been widespread speculation that a Conservative member in a safe seat
in the party’s stronghold of Alberta will step down to allow Mr. Poilievre to return
to the House of Commons through a special election.
Outside a restored mill in Manotick, Mr. Fanjoy acknowledged that the
constituency has not suddenly joined the rest of Ottawa as Liberal territory.
“I discovered that while there’s a strong conservative tradition in Carleton, it
wasn’t a Pierre Poilievre tradition,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/canada/canada-poilievre-election-conservatives.html
Lizzie Dearden,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,Man Who Tried to Enter Israeli Embassy in London Charged With Terror Offense,"A man has been charged with a terrorism offense in London after he attempted to
enter the Israeli Embassy armed with two knives, the police said on Wednesday.
The Metropolitan Police, which is responsible for law enforcement in London, said
Abdullah Sabah Albadri, 33, was arrested after being seen “attempting to gain
unauthorized access” to the grounds of the embassy shortly before 6 p.m. on
Monday.
“Officers prevented the man from entering and arrested him on suspicion of a
public order offense, trespassing on a designated site and possession of an
offensive weapon,” the police force said in a statement.

“He was taken to a London police station and after further enquiries were carried
out he was further arrested on suspicion of an offense contrary to Section 5 of the
Terrorism Act 2006.”
The charge is used against people accused of preparing or attempting terror
attacks.
Mr. Albadri, of no fixed address, has also been charged with two counts of
possession of a bladed article, the statement added.
Mr. Albadri appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday afternoon
but spoke only to confirm his identity and did not enter a plea.
Prosecutor Kristel Pous said that police officers tackled Mr. Albadri after seeing
him attempt to climb over a wall outside the embassy. After his arrest, she said, a
“martyrdom note” was found in his pocket, though she did not give further details.
Ms. Pous said Mr. Albadri told officers at the scene that he wanted to “send a
message to the Israeli government to stop the war” in Gaza.
Judge Tan Ikram said Mr. Albadri would be held in custody ahead of another
hearing on May 7.
Dominic Murphy, the head of the Metropolitan Police’s Counter Terrorism
Command, said that the police were not seeking anyone else in connection with the
incident and that they did not believe there was “any wider threat to the public.”
The Israeli Embassy, in the Kensington neighborhood, has tight security measures.
In a statement, the Embassy thanked the police for preventing what it described as
an “attempted terror attack.”
“We are relieved to report that this attack was prevented by the British security
forces and that no injuries occurred and all embassy staff and visitors are safe,” the
statement added.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia has won a second term, completing
a stunning turnaround for his governing center-left Labor Party that trailed in the
polls for months as a festering cost-of-living crisis weighed on voters.
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the country’s public broadcaster, called
the election for Mr. Albanese just a half-hour after the last polls closed on Saturday.
It was a resounding defeat of the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton. He
began the campaign riding dissatisfaction with the status quo, but was hamstrung
by a string of missteps and an association with some of President Trump’s
messaging and policies.

Term in Remarkable Comeback

Mr. Dutton, the leader of the Liberal Party, also lost his parliamentary seat in the
conservative stronghold of Queensland, which he had held since 2001. His loss
echoed the ouster of Canada’s conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, whose defeat
was seen as a rejection of his embrace of Mr. Trump.
Australia was the third major U.S. ally, after Germany and Canada, to hold
elections since Mr. Trump’s second term began in January. The Trump
administration’s efforts to influence the vote in Germany did not appear to bear
fruit. In Canada, Mark Carney won another term on an anti-Trump platform. While
Mr. Trump did not figure as prominently in Australia’s election, the global turmoil
unleashed by his administration has weighed on voters there.
Neither camp mentioned Mr. Trump by name on Saturday night but the nods to his
influence were clear. In his victory speech, an emotional Mr. Albanese said
Australians had chosen “to face global challenges the Australian way.”
“We do not need to beg, or borrow, or copy from anywhere else,” he said. “We do
not seek our inspiration overseas.”

For many younger voters, Mr. Albanese’s re-election was not an approval of his
first term but a reluctant choice between two parties without bold ideas to fix the
country’s problems, said Intifar Chowdhury, a lecturer in government at Flinders
University in Adelaide.
In giving Mr. Albanese a second term, she said, “you are choosing the known evil
over the unknown evil.”
With more than half the votes counted, the ABC projected that the Labor Party
would widen its parliamentary majority in the 150-seat House of Representatives
to at least 86 seats, from 78.
Voters casting their ballots Saturday said they were struggling to make ends meet.
“Everything costs so much,” said Judy Pula, a registered nurse and mother of two
who was voting in the Sydney suburb of Liverpool during a break in her shift. Ms.
Pula, 29, said she had voted for Labor in the past but this time opted for the
Australian Greens. “I feel like a new leader would be beneficial for us.”
Cognizant of citizens’ pocketbook concerns, Mr. Dutton went to more than a dozen
gas stations on the campaign trail, pitching his party’s proposal to cut a tax to
reduce the price at the pump. Mr. Albanese repeatedly flashed his card for
Medicare, Australia’s universal health care system, highlighting a promise to lower
out-of-pocket costs.

Yet both parties mostly put forth largely incremental, short-term relief proposals
rather than ambitious changes to address the fundamental roots of the current
doldrums. The candidates also largely steered clear of what many agree is the
most challenging global environment for Australia in a generation: its heavy
reliance on the United States for defense and its economic dependence on trade
with China, which has become less tenable as rivalry between the two superpowers
flares up.
“Mate, I’m not confident in either of them,” said Deb Young, 54, who had gone to
the polls near Brisbane in Mr. Dutton’s home state of Queensland with her 11-year-
old granddaughter. “They just keep addressing the same thing — cost of living.
Move on. Why don’t they address the other issues out there?”
Ms. Young, a mental health nurse, still cast her vote for Mr. Dutton’s center-right
Liberal Party, because she wanted Labor out of power.
Saturday’s victory for Mr. Albanese was a hard-fought recovery from the political
low point of his first term: the failure of a 2023 referendum to enshrine the rights of
representation for Aboriginal Australians in Parliament. It had been a major
campaign pledge of his when he was elected the previous year.
Mr. Dutton, a former police officer, opposed the measure and continued to take a
stance against other symbolic recognitions of Indigenous people, saying they were
“overdone.”

Early in the campaign, Mr. Dutton had adopted some buzzwords or policies that
echoed Mr. Trump, including denouncing what he characterized as “wokeness” and
diversity initiatives. That strategy seemed aimed at riding the worldwide
rightward, anti-incumbent currents that dominated last year. But as the first
months of the Trump presidency have played out, the association began to hurt Mr.
Dutton.
Grahame Don, 56, voted for the Liberal Party for decades but started backing
Labor in the last election. Mr. Trump’s tone of talking about issues was bleeding
into Australian politics, he said on Saturday.
“This country has only gained from things like migration and international
students that they have tried to make divisive,” he said.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/asia/australia-prime-minister-

Neil MacFarquhar,NYT,1,World,5/3/2025,Oil Prices Are Falling. Here’s Where That Could Spell Trouble.,"Oil producing countries are bracing for a bumpy ride this year, with a precipitous
drop in prices to the lowest levels in four years seen as the initial, alarming sign of
looming turmoil.
A price drop benefits any country seeking to cut its fuel bill. But in oil producing
nations, lower prices can feed economic troubles, and sometimes political unrest,
as governments slash spending.
Analysts who had already been predicting lower oil prices because of softening
demand amid increased global production said the possibility of a tariff trade war
and the overall climate of uncertainty could well deepen producers’ woes.
“The steep price dive and overall volatility is sending a very strong signal that the
global economy is going to be rattled this year and that will translate into a lower
demand for oil,” said Gregory Brew, a specialist on the geopolitics of oil and gas
with the Eurasia Group, a New York-based risk analysis organization.

Wealthy producers may be able to cushion the blow
Earlier this year, the price for benchmark crude held steady around $73 a barrel,
high enough to sustain the budgets of most producing nations. But some countries,
like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, base ambitious development plans
on a price of at least $90 a barrel, analysts say.

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have earmarked hundreds of billions of
dollars for giant projects to try to diversify their economies away from oil. Although
Saudi Arabia pays for its Vision 2030 development program outside its annual
budget, the huge, futuristic city project, Neom, depends on oil revenues.
To maintain those plans amid lower prices, these richer Gulf nations either have to
draw money from their gargantuan reserve funds or borrow, analysts said. Saudi
Arabia, the U.A.E. and Kuwait all have easy access to international credit, and can
sustain that for years with citizens unlikely to feel the effects, analysts said.
A different story for Iran and Iraq
In Iran, international sanctions have whittled its oil customers down. There’s
China, but its demand for oil has slackened markedly amid an economic slowdown.
And there are small independent refineries vulnerable to secondary sanctions,
which the United States has imposed against two of them in recent months. To
attract buyers, Iran will quite likely have to offer steep discounts, analysts said.
Iran is negotiating with Washington over the future of its nuclear program; any
agreement could bring sanctions relief. But that is unlikely this year.
Iran also faces increasing pressure to cut spending by lowering its domestic energy
subsidies. When it did that in 2019, antigovernment riots erupted and were put
down with force. “Keeping energy prices very low is extremely important because
they know that if they don’t, then they are at a relatively high risk of uprisings,
riots and demonstrations,” said Homayoun Falakshahi, an analyst at the research
firm Kpler.
Next door, Iraq depends on oil for an estimated 80 percent of government revenue,
so a drop in price would force it to take measures like not paying public sector
salaries for chunks of time, a step sure to create domestic discontent. Since the
country is not under sanctions, it too can borrow internationally to cover its bills,
although that is costly.

Vulnerability in Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela
Libya’s two governments each hold a different half of the country. One runs the
bank that takes in oil payments from abroad and the other controls the oil fields.
Any price drop would likely ratchet up tensions between the two as they jockey
over the revenue, analysts said.
Nigeria’s economy remains terribly vulnerable to a drop in oil revenue, on which it
depends to help subsidize energy prices. A new, almost completed private refinery
could mitigate the kind of fuel supply problems that can spark political unrest.
Aside from Iran, the other global producer most exposed to price volatility is
Venezuela, whose economy collapsed during the drop in prices in 2014-15. Public
sector businesses and a bloated government payroll were so dependent on high oil
prices that when they collapsed, analysts said, the ensuing economic problems
sparked widespread protests that the government put down violently.
Help from Russia and Iran has helped leaven the potential fallout this time around,
since increased production and refinery capacity mean Venezuela is unlikely to
face the kind of fuel shortages that caused widespread blackouts and fueled public
anger.

And then, there’s Russia
In Russia, about one third of the federal budget, predicated on about $70 a barrel
for oil, comes from energy revenues. With sanctions, Russia discounts its oil by
about $10 a barrel; a $60 price matches the price cap imposed in 2022 after it
invaded Ukraine.
Robust oil and gas sales, especially to China and India, have helped insulate
ordinary Russians from much economic fallout from the war. The Kremlin has
already eaten into its reserve funds, however, and a further price drop would make
paying for the war, and everything else, challenging.
Moscow probably still has enough cash reserves to muddle through, but in the
short term, there could be pain, analysts said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/world/europe/oil-prices-tariffs.html
Zia ur-Rehman,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,Families Are Split as Pakistan Deports Thousands of Afghan Refugees,"Every night in Karachi, a bustling port city in Pakistan, Fatima Bibi goes to bed in
fear. The sound of police sirens from the streets outside makes her anxious. She
wonders whether a knock at the door might tear her family apart.
Her husband, Sher Zada, is an Afghan refugee. His family fled conflict in
Afghanistan when he was just a boy, in 1992, and Pakistan is the only home he
knows. Ms. Bibi’s family long hoped that despite Mr. Zada’s undocumented status,
his close ties to the country and marriage to a Pakistani national would eventually
help him secure permanent residency, if not citizenship.
But to the Pakistani government, it is officially past time for Mr. Zada to leave.

On March 31, a government-imposed deadline expired for many Afghans in
Pakistan to find another country of refuge. Those without legal status who remain
in Pakistan, like Mr. Zada, now face repatriation. Less than three weeks after the
deadline’s expiration, the Pakistani minister of state for interior, Talal Chaudhry,
announced at a news conference that more than 80,000 Afghans had already been
expelled.
The deportations could subject the refugees to perilous conditions under the heavy
hand of Taliban rule in Afghanistan. And, if they are married to Pakistanis, it could
mean leaving their families behind.
“What will happen to my children and me if Zada is taken away?” Ms. Bibi said.

The campaign to deport Afghans coincides with a resurgent conflict with India,
Pakistan’s eastern neighbor and archrival. India has ordered almost all Pakistani
citizens to leave the country, part of its response to a terrorist attack in Kashmir
that it has linked to Pakistan. The Pakistani government, which denies any
involvement in the attack and has asked for an international investigation into it,
responded by canceling most Indian citizens’ visas.
Pakistan’s crackdown on Afghans follows years of tightening restrictions on Afghan
residency. Recent U.N. reports indicate that over 910,000 Afghans have been
deported from the country since September 2023.
The deportations have been motivated largely by officials’ frustration with the
Taliban government, which they accuse of harboring Pakistani militants
responsible for deadly attacks inside Pakistan. The Taliban deny those allegations,
but tensions continue to rise.
Pakistan’s military said on Sunday that it had killed 54 militants trying to infiltrate
the country from Afghanistan over the previous two nights. Pakistan said the
militants had been “khawarij” — a term it often uses for the Pakistani Taliban.
The Pakistani government has also been emboldened by a tide of anti-immigrant
sentiment around the world. It has drawn parallels to recent deportation efforts in
the United States and various European countries to justify its own campaign.
Among the Afghans facing deportation in Pakistan are those who arrived after the
Taliban seized power in August 2021 and now await resettlement in Western
countries, including the United States. Pakistan extended the deadline for their
relocation to another country to Wednesday, after which they will again face
deportation.
Their fate became increasingly uncertain in January when President Trump issued
an executive order suspending all refugee admissions to the United States. The
decision left thousands of Afghans stranded in Pakistan with no clear recourse.

In October 2023, during an earlier wide-ranging effort to expel undocumented
Afghans, Mr. Zada was detained. He narrowly avoided deportation only after Ms.
Bibi’s father paid a last-minute bribe to secure his release.
This year’s renewed deportation campaign forced Mr. Zada and his family to leave
their home. Ms. Bibi’s father offered them shelter, putting himself at risk. At the
news conference this month, Mr. Chaudhry warned of strict repercussions for
anyone who helped Afghans stay in the country illegally.
Rights groups say that the plight of refugees like Mr. Zada — Afghans married to
Pakistani citizens — is one of the most overlooked aspects of Pakistan’s deportation
drive.
While no official data on the subject is available, rights groups like the Joint Action
Committee for Refugees, a Pakistani civil society network, estimate that thousands
of Afghan-Pakistani marriages have taken place. They are especially common in
parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, Pakistani provinces that share a
porous border with Afghanistan.
Such weddings are often conducted through tribal customs or informal community
ceremonies. Though socially recognized, the unions frequently lack formal
documentation, such as marriage certificates, making it hard for the Afghan spouse
to obtain legal residency or citizenship.
Even in big cities like Karachi, Afghans with Pakistani spouses often face obstacles
to formally registering their marriages or the births of their children.
According to Pakistan’s National Database and Registration Authority, or NADRA,
foreign spouses of Pakistani citizens are eligible for a Pakistan origin card, which
would grant them visa-free entry and the right to stay indefinitely and own
property. But many Afghan applicants are denied the card.

cannot afford the fees. Abdul Basit/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images
Legal experts have told Mr. Zada that his marriage to Ms. Bibi gives him a chance,
if a slim one, of staying in Pakistan legally. But the lengthy process and the high
fees are prohibitive. Mr. Zada earns just $3 a day, he said.
Some Pakistanis married to Afghans have turned to the judiciary for relief from the
bureaucratic obstacles. In July, a court in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ruled in favor of 65
petitioners, affirming that their Afghan spouses were eligible for dual nationality.
But such cases are uncommon.
Umer Ijaz Gilani, an expert on refugee rights based in Pakistan’s capital,
Islamabad, said the authorities had deliberately fostered the perception that
refugees had few options for obtaining legal residency or citizenship, despite
constitutional guarantees and numerous rulings from higher courts.
“The core problem lies in the government’s erratic and inadequate implementation
of existing safeguards, not in the laws themselves,” Mr. Gilani said.
Refugee-rights activists also say that NADRA withholds origin cards from
applicants who qualify, often citing the need for clearance from Pakistan’s
intelligence agencies. NADRA officials declined to comment on those claims.
Regardless of family ties, all undocumented Afghans must leave the country, Pakistani officials said.

The Pakistani authorities remain firmly committed to the deportation campaign.
Officials say that all undocumented Afghans must leave the country and re-enter
on valid visas, regardless of marital or familial connections. But current
immigration restrictions can make it almost impossible for them to secure visas
after they leave.
Mukaram Shah, an undocumented Afghan migrant married to a Pakistani woman,
had been living on the outskirts of Quetta, a city about 70 miles from the Afghan
border. In December 2023, he was arrested by the police while working as a porter
at a local vegetable market.
Without any legal proceedings, his family said, Mr. Shah was taken directly to the
Chaman border crossing and deported to Afghanistan.
“We could not even say a proper goodbye,” said his wife, Palwasha, who, like many
women from rural Pakistan, goes by a single name.
Her family, citing security and economic concerns, refused to let her follow her
husband, believing he would return on a long-term visa. But under the current
crackdown on Afghan refugees, that hope is fading.
“Every night, my children ask when their father will come home,” Palwasha said,
her voice breaking. “I don’t have an answer. All I can do is pray.”

Max Bearak,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,"Days After Trump Commits to Seabed Mining, Two Sides Face Off","Less than a week after President Trump signed an executive order to accelerate
seabed mining, the U.S. government received its first permit application from the
Metals Company, one of the most ardent proponents of the as yet unproven
practice.
On Tuesday, the company’s chief executive, Gerard Barron, was also on hand in
Washington for a contentious hearing in front of the House Natural Resources
Committee. He likened Mr. Trump’s move to a “starting gun” in the race to extract
minerals like cobalt and nickel from potato-size nodules lying in the frigid, pitch-
black, two-and-a-half-mile-deep sands of the Pacific Ocean floor.
Republican and Democratic committee members clashed over how much weight
should be given to environmental concerns about the practice. The Trump
administration has said it will consider issuing permits for mining in territorial U.S.
waters and also in international waters.
Other countries have condemned the United States for essentially circumventing
international law by saying it would permit seabed mining in waters that nearly
every other country considers to be governed by the International Seabed
Authority, an independent organization.
No commercial-scale seabed mining has ever taken place.
Representative Jared Huffman of California, who is also the committee’s ranking
Democrat, said the Metals Company and Mr. Trump were moving seabed mining
forward in a “reckless cowboy manner.” He and other Democrats questioned the
business case for mining cobalt and nickel given that electric-vehicle
manufacturers, once major buyers of the metals, were moving toward batteries
that didn’t use them.
“The industry’s financial models are based on wildly optimistic assumptions and
fail to reflect the volatility and reality of global mineral markets,” said
Representative Maxine E. Dexter, Democrat of Oregon.
The Metals Company sought to assure the committee that any damage to the
seafloor would be far outweighed by potential job creation and access to minerals
whose supply chains are currently dominated by China. The company says it has
conducted a decade of expensive environmental studies that support its
conclusions.
Mr. Trump’s order came after years of delays at the International Seabed Authority
in setting up a regulatory framework for seabed mining. The authority, created
decades ago under the auspices of the United Nations, is likely to miss another
deadline this year to codify those rules.
“It took 14 years just to begin drafting a mining code,” Mr. Barron told the
committee, calling it “a deliberate strategy” to slow seabed mining.
He also said a polymetallic nodule extracted by his company was presented to Mr.
Trump recently, and he claimed it now sat on the president’s desk in the Oval
Office.
The U.S. Geological Survey has estimated that nodules in a single swath of the
Eastern Pacific, known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, contain more nickel, cobalt
and manganese than all terrestrial reserves combined. That area, where the
Metals Company is proposing to mine, is in the open ocean between Mexico and
Hawaii and covers an area about half the size of the continental United States.
The committee’s chairman, Representative Paul Gosar, Republican of Arizona, said
seabed mining was needed to get the United States out from under the “supply
chain yoke” of China, which currently processes a majority of the world’s cobalt,
much of its nickel and many other critical minerals, which include so-called rare
earths.
China recently imposed export restrictions on some rare-earth elements, leading to
fears that American companies using them to make an array of advanced
electronics would face shortages.
The House committee also heard from Thomas Peacock, a professor of mechanical
engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has taken part in
studies of seabed mining’s effects on the seafloor, some of which were funded in
part by the Metals Company.
Dr. Peacock said that while there were potentially hundreds of unknown species in
the Clarion-Clipperton Zone and that specific areas deserved to be cordoned off
from mining, “research indicates that some of the proposed impacts of nodule
mining may not be as severe as speculated.”
In particular, he downplayed the risks that mining could cause plumes of sand and
debris that could affect life on the seafloor as well as closer to the surface of the
open ocean, where fish like tuna live and feed. The debris would be “roughly the
equivalent of a grain of sand in a fishbowl,” Dr. Peacock said.
Sitting next to Mr. Barron was the chief executive of another prospective deep-sea
miner, Impossible Metals. Unlike the Metals Company, which has extraction
technology that resembles a vacuum attached to an autonomous vehicle that would
trundle across the seafloor, sending up nodules to a ship through a pipe, Impossible
Metals says it has a machine that will pick up nodules individually and without
actually landing on the seafloor.
“Our underwater robots hover to collect the mineral-rich nodules from the seabed
through an A.I.-driven selective harvesting,” Oliver Gunasekara, the chief
executive of Impossible Metals, said. “We pick up nodules individually avoiding all
visible life, leaving 60 percent untouched.”
The company has reapplied for an exploration permit off American Samoa in U.S.
territorial waters. Mr. Gunasekara said that while an earlier application had been
denied under the Biden administration, both American Samoa and Washington
were under new leadership and he was confident of its approval.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/climate/seabed-mining-trump-congress.html
Frances Robles,NYT,1,World,4/14/2025,A Small City That Lost Big in the Dominican Nightclub Tragedy,"Half the board of directors of a seniors club perished, as did the president of the
Lion’s Club, a high school teacher and the owner of a trucking company. Tony
Blanco, a retired major league baseball player who died in the disaster, was a
native son.
So was Rubby Pérez, the merengue singer whose concert drew more than 400
people — many from his hometown.
In the wake of a nightclub roof collapse that killed hundreds of people, the
Dominican Republic is brimming in grief. That heartbreak is perhaps most
palpable in Haina, an industrial city outside the capital that lost more than two
dozen people in the tragedy, including community leaders and cultural heroes.
A gritty municipality best known for its bustling seaport and a legacy of lead
pollution that once gave it the unwelcome moniker “the Dominican Chernobyl” now
has another undesirable distinction. When the roof of the Jet Set disco came
crashing down last Tuesday morning, killing 226 people, it dealt a heavy blow to the
small city.
Twenty-five people from there were among those who died.
“God has a way of communicating with us, and sometimes it is difficult to
understand,” the former Red Sox player David Ortiz, better known as Big Papi, said
Sunday. Mr. Ortiz used to live in Haina, and traveled there to help bury its dead.

Joined by the president, Luis Abinader, dozens of residents gathered in a
sweltering gym to say goodbye. They clutched white roses and tried through tears
to understand how a single town could lose so many people. Some wondered aloud
how they would ever manage to laugh and sing again.
A photo slide show of the victims flashed on two large screens while an evangelical
pastor and a Catholic priest offered consoling words.
The singer Joselito Trinidad performed stirring ballad renditions of “Looking For
Your Kisses” and “I Will Return,” two of Mr. Pérez’s merengue songs. He sang in
the high pitch that Mr. Pérez, known as the “highest voice in merengue,” was
famous for.
“We are a people who have known how to unite through thick and thin, and this is
no exception,” he said before singing. “As a native Hainero, I raise my voice so that
we remember that voice that took wings and went to a better place.”
In the gym, many bleacher seats remained empty: People around town were busy
attending funerals.

“Oh, my beautiful friend, there’s no one like her anymore!” cried Kirsis Bautista,
whose friend, Juana Vásquez, died in the disaster. “Mr. President, justice! Let me
see Luis Abinader and say: ‘justice!’”
Mr. Pérez, 69, was a well-known merengue artist and a member of the Golden
Haineros, a private social club for people over 55 to gather and attend educational
workshops. The club’s 143 members were also his fans, so 25 of them made the half-
hour trip to Santo Domingo to watch him perform at Jet Set.
Only 12 made it out.
The organization’s vice president died, as did the treasurer and event planner.
“The first thing I said when I heard about what happened was that I was going to
quit,” said Hectór Rincón, the club’s president. “People told me, ‘no, we have to find
the strength to keep this going in honor of those who died.’”
The seniors rent a space above a nightclub called the House of the Drunk, where
they play dominoes and throw birthday parties, adhering to strict rules: no talk of
politics, religion or sports.
On Sunday morning before the service, the club was still decorated in balloons and
birthday banners from the last celebration, but a large black ribbon on the front
door gave away that something terrible had happened. The mood was grim among
a handful of members, gathered before yet another funeral.

Now instead of organizing jewelry-making workshops, Mr. Rincón is looking for
psychologists to help survivors. “This is like a war,” he said. “When you come back
from war, you are not the same.”
Mr. Rincón grew up with Mr. Pérez, and they sang in a choir together as teenagers.
“Haina was his everything,” Mr. Rincón said.
He tried to share more fond memories of his friend. Tears got in the way, so he
talked instead about the town’s industrial history.
Haina’s official name, which nobody uses, is Bajos de Haina, or the Haina
Lowlands. Home to about 158,000 people, it is about eight miles west of Santo
Domingo.
The country’s only oil refinery is here, and its port moves more than a third of the
country’s maritime cargo.

Mr. Rincón recalled its heyday, when a sugar mill and other factories churned out
engineers, mechanics and workers in other skilled trades. Those businesses are
gone now.
“This was a town of migrants — mostly miners and agricultural workers,” said
Jesús Ramírez, a member of the Lions Club, which lost three members. “And it
turned out some of the country’s best sports players and artists.”
The Lion’s Club will particularly miss its president, Luis Emilio Guillén, who was
also vice president of the seniors’ club. A former soccer player who owned a trophy
company, he was known for attending every cultural and sports event.
“We are going to continue the work he was doing in sports and culture,” said
Margarita Tejeda, who represents Haina in Congress and is a Lion’s Club member.
“This is a collective pain. Everyone is in a lot of pain.”

England ahead of local elections, hoping to convert a polling surge for Reform
U.K. into power.

Updated May 2, 2025
The pulsing beat of a dance track grew to a thunderous pitch and the crowd rose to
its feet. Beams of light flashed across the cavernous arena in Birmingham, central
England. Then, at last, Nigel Farage, the right-wing populist leader who claims he
can fix a “broken Britain,” arrived onstage, hitching a ride on a backhoe.
Mr. Farage, who leads the anti-immigration party Reform U.K., has long been one
of Britain’s most ardent supporters of President Trump. He has learned from the
president’s campaign tactics, too.
That means, among other things, that the political rally is back in Britain.
Why Nigel Farage is Bringing MAGA-Style
Rallies to Britain

The Times’s chief political analyst, makes sense of the latest political
data. Get it in your inbox.
In the weeks before municipal elections and a special election in England on May 1,
Mr. Farage has been touring the country, taking to the stage in Cornwall,
Darlington and Hull, smiling broadly, cracking jokes and railing against “illegal
immigrants,” whom he promises to deport.
Since returning to the leadership of Reform last year and then being elected as a
British lawmaker for the first time, Mr. Farage has led the insurgent party to an
extraordinary surge in the polls. It won 14 percent of the vote last July, but now
regularly polls at around 25 percent, overtaking the main opposition Conservatives
and, in some surveys, the governing Labour Party.

Thursday’s elections, while limited in number, are the first test of Reform’s ability
to convert that polling into power. Analysts expect the party to emerge with
hundreds of municipal seats and two regional mayors. It’s also favored to win a
closely fought special election for a parliamentary seat the same night.
Mr. Farage is a charismatic, fluent speaker who, like Mr. Trump, embraces an “us-
versus-them” rhetoric when it comes to undocumented immigrants and other
political parties. His rallies stand out in a country where the bulk of politics long
ago switched from public speechmaking to TV and now social media.
British politicians tend to address large crowds now only during election
campaigns or at their annual party conferences. Jeremy Corbyn, the hard-left
former leader of the Labour Party, was a notable exception in 2017 when he spoke
at the Glastonbury music festival and was serenaded enthusiastically by
concertgoers.
“Rallies have gone out of political fashion,” said Neil Kinnock, who led Labour from
1983 to 1992, and was one of the most accomplished orators of his era. He was
famed for his platform speeches, including his 1983 warning against voting
Conservative and his passionate denunciation of the hard left in 1985. He’s also
cited in Britain as an example of oratory’s dangers: An arena rally he held before
the 1992 election was seen by some critics as contributing to Labour’s defeat that
year, though polling evidence contradicts the theory.
Mr. Kinnock is no fan of Mr. Farage’s speeches. “When I’m being condescending —
sorry — I think of it as saloon bar chatter from behind a microphone,” he said. “But
with the right audience it’s certainly effective.”
Reform’s rallies stand out in Britain, where politics today usually focuses on social media, not on large

The Reform rally formula, Mr. Kinnock said, includes lots of noise, speakers to
warm up the crowd, then “a Farage crescendo,” where the leader “is projected as a
sort of Everyman Messiah.” The rallies are “not unlike Trump’s,” he noted, with
“repetitive themes, some rambling, with phrases that the audience likes;
references to immigration and its alleged consequences are unmissable.”
Mr. Trump’s MAGA events have sometimes drawn tens of thousands to big open-
air venues. They feature a thumping soundtrack (“Y.M.C.A.,” by the Village People,
is a standard), as well as provocative, crowd-pleasing moments, like when Mr.
Trump points out the TV cameras and journalists at the back of the arena and
labels them “fake news.”
Such theatrics played a critical role in Mr. Trump’s political rise, according to
Stephen K. Bannon, who was chief executive of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign.
“When he came down that escalator in New York and went to Iowa two days later,
we had nothing,” said Mr. Bannon, referring to June 2015, when Mr. Trump
announced his candidacy. “The rallies became everything. The Trump campaign
was essentially a series of rallies.”
After the Brexit vote in 2016, Mr. Bannon said the campaign recognized Mr.
Farage’s value as a warm-up act. In August that year, Mr. Farage appeared
alongside Mr. Trump at a MAGA rally in Jackson, Miss.

York Times
Brexit was Britain’s “Independence Day,” Mr. Farage declared, as Mr. Trump
beamed and clapped.
“We drilled Brexit into people’s heads,” Mr. Bannon said. “By the time we had Nigel
come over, he was a rock star among the MAGA faithful. You have to have someone
with charisma. He’s also a fun guy, like Trump.”
At the event in Birmingham, Reform had built a stage set intended to symbolize a
depleted nation, including a mound of trash bags (a clear reference to the city’s
garbage strike), a bus stop covered in graffiti and a shuttered pub.
Mr. Farage attacked the government’s net zero targets and pledged that a Reform
government would “get rid of the Human Rights Act” and deport undocumented
migrants. “Let me tell you, everyone who comes illegally will be deported, end of
story,” he said, to the loudest whoops and cheers of the night.
Birmingham was not — as had been promised — the largest political rally in
modern British history. The party said it sold around 10,000 tickets but there were
hundreds of empty seats. Yet by drawing thousands of people, some traveling
hundreds of miles, to a political event, Mr. Farage achieved something no other
British party has recently attempted.
He has already held rallies at critical moments of a long political career in which he
has led three parties and campaigned for Brexit. In 2016, just before the
referendum in which Britain voted to leave the European Union, Mr. Farage
addressed supporters in Gateshead in northeastern England, holding up a placard
reading: “We want our country back.”

Last year, his arrival at a rally in Clacton-on-Sea, which he now represents in
Parliament, was marked by pyrotechnics and an Eminem song booming out:
“Guess who’s back, back again?”
In the Birmingham arena, Caroline Woodman, 61, from Leigh on Sea, an Essex
town more than two hours’ drive from the venue, said she wanted lower
immigration, higher living standards and to “get rid of the wokeness.” Unable to
work while she awaits a foot operation, Ms. Woodman, a teacher, said she was
raised in a Labour-supporting family but has voted for Mr. Farage for more than
two decades.
“I know he’s an honest, dutiful, kind person who would put our country first and he
will look after the people,” she said.
Gary Jackson, 56, from east Yorkshire, is a retired police commander. He
previously voted Conservative but now expects Mr. Farage to be the next prime
minister. “I don’t know any other politician who answers as straight as he does,” he
said.
Robert Hayward, a Conservative member of the House of Lords and a polling
expert, said the rallies were galvanizing the supporters needed to build Reform
U.K. into a nationwide party that could challenge Labour in 2028 or 2029, when
Britain will next hold a general election.
“It establishes a sense of momentum by bringing all these people together,” said
Mr. Hayward. “No other party at the moment could do anything like that.”

Reporting from Singapore
Published May 2, 2025
Updated May 3, 2025, 10:38 a.m. ET
The last time Singapore held elections, it was in the throes of a global crisis. That’s
also true today.
Five years ago, the governing party portrayed itself as the steady hand to guide
the nation through the coronavirus pandemic. The pitch is the same this time, only
with a different catalyst: President Trump’s upending of the international trade
order.
And, like last time, there is no doubt that the People’s Action Party, which has been
in power since 1959, will retain office. But Saturday’s election will be a test of the
popularity of the P.A.P., which had a near record-low showing in 2020, even as it
garnered a clear majority. It was growing evidence of a desire for a competitive
democracy in the city-state.
Counting started on Saturday night after polling stations closed at 8 p.m. local time.
A final result is not expected until after midnight. The voting age in Singapore is 21,
and all citizens are required to vote. About 82 percent of 2.6 million eligible voters
had cast their ballots as of 5 p.m., according to the elections department.
Many political analysts agree that the opposition is gaining clout in Singapore, with
voters unhappy about the P.A.P.’s response to the rising cost of living. During the
campaign, rallies for the country’s main opposition party, the Workers’ Party, were
packed. Still, Pritam Singh, the party’s leader, took pains to assure the public that
his party was not contesting enough seats to form a government, merely that
Singapore needed a more balanced political system.
“When you have opposition in Parliament, your alternative voice is heard by the
government,” Mr. Singh said at his party’s first rally last week.

Steven Yeong, 54, echoed that sentiment. “Like many Singaporeans, I would like to
see more robust debates in Parliament, with more representation from diverse
voices,” said Mr. Yeong, who has been unemployed for six months.
Another issue that has been a worry, he added, is how “the government makes it
rather easy for educated foreigners to compete for jobs with us.”
The election is the first under Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who took office last
year after the two-decade tenure of Lee Hsien Loong, a son of Singapore’s founding
father. Mr. Wong has said that navigating the trade war and U.S.-China tensions
“will take people in government who have built up trust and close relationships
with their counterparts in both America and China.”
Mr. Wong has warned that the tariffs imposed by the United States will hurt
Singapore. Its economy is highly dependent on international trade, with a trade-to-
GDP ratio of more than 300 percent, nearly five times the global average. Situated
along the Straits of Malacca, one of the world’s major shipping lanes, Singapore’s
port ranks among the world’s busiest.
Mr. Wong reiterated the same argument that his party has made for decades: that
the P.A.P. has a track record of delivering stability and prosperity to this nation of
nearly six million, one of the world’s richest per capita.
The problem is, many average Singaporeans no longer feel prosperous. Singapore
now has more millionaires than London. While average wealth has more than
doubled in local currency terms, median wealth has fallen 1.8 percent from 2008 to
2023, according to the Swiss bank UBS.

“We can see the gap growing quite substantially,” said Kris Tan, 44, a personal
trainer. His wife is a hawker, and he describes their family as lower to middle class.
“I am worried about our children’s future in terms of housing, in terms of the cost
of living for them.”
Mr. Tan said he was also concerned about the growing elitism, which he says “is
getting more and more obvious with regards to the upper echelons of the
government compared to the people.” He referenced the million-dollar salaries that
the country’s ministers earn.
“My concern is that the government is bringing the country up,” he said, “but it’s
also leaving a lot of people behind.”
In the last election, the P.A.P. conceded a record 10 seats to the opposition. Since
then, the government has bolstered social spending, giving temporary financial
support to people who have been laid off and offering vouchers to help with daily
expenses. But it has continued to face discontent over the rising cost of living,
increases in the sales tax, and declining housing affordability, issues that the
opposition has seized on.
The opposition has widely criticized the P.A.P. for holding one of the world’s
shortest campaigning periods — nine days — and for gerrymandering by
redrawing election boundaries in districts where they had made gains in the
previous poll. The P.A.P. rejected the assertions, saying that the electoral
boundaries review committee operates independently of the government.
In February, Mr. Singh was found guilty of lying under oath to Parliament, but
voters shrugged it off. In a survey conducted by Blackbox Research in the weeks
before the election, Mr. Singh had an approval rating of 71 percent, up seven points
from the previous quarter. Mr. Wong was a touch ahead, with 75 percent.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/asia/singapore-election-pap-

Euan Ward;Aaron Boxerman;Hwaida Saad;Vivian Yee,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,"Sectarian Clashes Spread Around Syria’s Capital, Drawing In Israel","Israel launched airstrikes on Syria on Wednesday and threatened to strike
government forces there if clashes persisted between pro-government fighters and
militiamen from the Druse minority.
Wading into the latest eruption of sectarian violence in the country, the Israeli
military said its aircraft had struck a group of “operatives” accused of having
“attacked Druse civilians” in spreading violence around the outskirts of the capital,
Damascus. The Syrian governor of the area, Amr al-Sheikh, said in a news
conference on Wednesday night that the airstrike had killed one member of the
Syrian government’s general security forces and one civilian.
The Israeli military did not identify the “operatives,” but forces aligned with the
Islamist government have been locked in fierce clashes in the area with Druse
militiamen for two days. Earlier, the Israeli government said its forces had targeted
members of an unidentified “extremist group” south of Damascus.
Israel is home to a substantial Druse community, many of whom see themselves as
loyal citizens and serve in the military.
Israel Strikes in Syria, Intervening in Sectarian
Violence
At least 39 people — including 22 on Wednesday — have been killed in two days of
clashes between Syrians on the outskirts of Damascus, according to the Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights, a war-monitoring group based in Britain.
The Israeli airstrikes on Wednesday came after violent clashes broke out around
the town of Ashrafieh Sahnaya, a largely Druse area south of Damascus.
The attacks on areas around Damascus with large Druse populations began
overnight Monday into Tuesday after an audio clip circulated on social media
purporting to be a Druse cleric insulting the Prophet Muhammad. The cleric
denied the accusation, and Syria’s Interior Ministry said that its initial findings
showed that he was not the person in the clip.
The violence is stoking fears among Syria’s diverse ethnic and religious minorities
who have grown increasingly worried about persecution under the rule of Syria’s
new Islamist leaders, who overthrew the dictator Bashar al-Assad in December.
The latest wave of sectarian violence began in the predominantly Druse city of
Jaramana. By the end of Tuesday, 17 people had been killed.
The unrest spread into Wednesday to Ashrafieh Sahnaya, where Druse militia
fighters battled “forces affiliated to the ministries of defense and interior and other
proxy forces” of the government, according to the war monitoring group.
Mr. al-Sheikh, the area’s governor, said in the news conference that members of
“outlaw groups” had attacked checkpoints staffed by government security forces in
Jaramana on Tuesday and in Ashrafieh Sahnaya on Wednesday, prompting the
government to cordon off both cities to protect them.
He said that 14 were killed in total on both sides Monday. Clashes then erupted
twice in Ashrafieh Sahnaya on Wednesday between government forces and the
outlaws, he said, killing 11 government forces.
Mr. al-Sheikh did not identify the “outlaw groups.” But in an apparent reference to
Druse militias who appear linked to Wednesday’s clashes, he repeated three times
that “weapons should be in the state’s hands.”
Syria’s new leaders have struggled to integrate the complex web of armed groups
operating across the country into the new state apparatus. Several of the strongest
Druse militias are in talks with the government about their conditions for
integrating into the army.
Abu Hassan, a Druse militia commander in the southern Syrian city of Sweida who
goes by a nom de guerre, painted a more sinister picture of the government forces
Mr. al-Sheikh had said had been involved, saying foreign fighters and other
extremist militants nominally affiliated with the government had been involved in
the attacks on Druse areas. Abu Hassan also suggested that the audio clip had been
a faked pretext for the violence, saying this was really about settling old scores in
the aftermath of Syria’s nearly 14-year civil war.
The state news agency, SANA, said armed gunmen — an apparent reference to the
Druse fighters — had attacked checkpoints and vehicles overnight on Wednesday
belonging to government forces in Ashrafieh Sahnaya.
An Interior Ministry official called the gunmen who attacked government forces
“criminals” and vowed that the government would strike back “with an iron fist,”
according to SANA.
Israel’s first airstrike on Wednesday was described as a warning against “an
extremist group” said to be preparing to attack Druse, according to a joint
statement by the Israeli prime minister’s office and the defense minister.
Israel has offered to protect the Druse in Syria should they come under attack amid
the tumultuous transition of power in the country. Many Syrian Druse have
rejected that offer, however, denouncing what they consider potentially destructive
foreign meddling.
Syria is a predominantly Sunni Muslim nation, while the Druse are a religious
group that practices a secretive religion rooted in Islam.
The rebels who ousted Mr. al-Assad were led by a Sunni Islamist group once linked
to Al Qaeda. They now run the government and the national military.
Since Mr. al-Assad was ousted, Israel has carried out numerous incursions in Syria,
raiding villages, launching hundreds of airstrikes and destroying military outposts.
Israel says that it wants to prevent weapons from falling into the hands of hostile
groups and that it does not want enemy forces to entrench themselves close to its
borders.
Sectarian violence has hit Syria several times since the ouster of Mr. al-Assad,
stoking fears among many minority groups that the country’s new leaders will
marginalize or target them.
Last month, a wave of sectarian killings spread across Syria’s coastal region, home
of the country’s Alawites, the minority group that the Assad family belongs to.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/middleeast/syria-sectarian-fighting-druse.html
Roger Cohen,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,Macron Surprises a Provincial Bar,"“Bonjour, Macron!”
At Le Prem’s, a small bar in western France that sells lottery tickets and tobacco,
this greeting has become a running joke since President Emmanuel Macron
dropped by unannounced the other day and bought a round of coffee for everyone,
save the customers who opted for a bracing midmorning sauvignon blanc.
“He did not come to scratch!” said Christophe Jacques, the cheerful bar owner,
alluding to the betting games he offers on scratch cards, where winning numbers
are revealed by scratching off an opaque covering. “He came to chat.”
Chat the president did, for more than an hour, about health care and jobs and
salaries and other day-to-day concerns of an anxious French people. Perched on a
bar stool against a backdrop of cigarette packets warning, “SMOKING

DIMINISHES FERTILITY,” he seemed happy to shoot the breeze. It was a break
for Mr. Macron from building Europe into a credible military power, now that the
United States often seems less friend than foe.
Some regulars — and the bar has many, especially among retirees — were so
shocked that they initially thought he was a Macron doppelgänger.
A farmer, Jean-Claude Turpault, 60, right, has coffee as part of his morning ritual at Le Prem’s, which

“I was studying the form for a horseracing bet, turned around and was face to face
with Macron!” said Jean-Claude Turpault, a farmer. “Could not believe it. I’d
imagined him more arrogant, but he was easy to talk to.”
A screen showed horse races. Newspapers hung from a rack, looking like relics. A
scratch card game called “Carats” did a brisk business. Black-and-white postcards
were on sale. Mr. Macron drank two espressos without sugar at the zinc bar, where
people lingered. They were not in a hurry; there was nothing to hurry to. Le Prem’s
felt like the France of the movies, where romance is kindled in faded bars, minus
the smoke.
Since taking office eight years ago, Mr. Macron has struggled to overcome an
image of lofty remoteness, which has earned him the sobriquet “Jupiter.” He has
tried, but to little avail, various remedies, including a three-month listening and
talking tour of the provinces after the Yellow Vest protests, sparked by a fuel price
hike, erupted in 2018.
Now, dispensing with the press, with cameras, with his entourage and with any
advance warning, Mr. Macron has taken to dropping in solo on random bars,
mainly so-called “PMU bar-tabacs,” the only places in France licensed to sell
tobacco and handle betting. They are distinguished by the orange diamond-like
symbol on their facades, colloquially known as “the carrot.”
These outlets for gambling on horses and much else, while having a drink and
enjoying what’s left of community camaraderie, are often among the few
commercial survivors in villages and small towns across France. Countless
bakeries, cafes, post offices, train stations, banks and Mom-and-Pop stores have
closed as online retail, big-box hypermarkets and pressure on municipal budgets
have taken a toll.

Thouars, a town of 14,000 inhabitants with a pretty setting on the Thouet river, is no
exception.
The once bustling Rue St.-Médard at its center is now a procession of shuttered
stores. Alexandre Fleveau, a hotel owner, described the main square as “an airport
parking lot” before the centrist mayor, Bernard Paineau, embarked on a bid to
“vegetalize” it with tree plantings and other improvements that, for now, have
turned it into a construction site. A new cultural center, offering movies and
exhibitions, will open soon.
“I pay taxes for all the people here doing nothing, and there are a lot of them,” said
Mr. Jacques, the bar owner. He is looking to sell the bar and move to the Camargue
region in southern France.
Mr. Macron, with two years left in his presidency, wants to get close, at last, to the
French people, who sometimes call him “extraterrestrial” for his technocratic and
intellectual bent. The two French presidents most fondly remembered in recent
decades are François Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac, because they demonstrated a
bond with the people — and the cattle — of France. The incumbent is aware of this.
Christophe Jacques, an owner of Le Prem’s. “I pay taxes for all the people here doing nothing, and there

“He’s looking for more proximity, simplicity, away from the cameras and media
pools that make sincerity impossible,” said a close adviser to Mr. Macron who
requested the anonymity under which officials at the presidency customarily
speak. “People are worried by Putin, by Trump, by the cost of living, and he has a
unique ability to reassure.”
For Mr. Macron’s critics, and there are many, this is no more than “authenticity in
kit form,” as the right-wing JDD Sunday newspaper put it recently.
Still, the Macron who pops in at Le Prem’s feels different, a man who gives shorter
speeches, projects authority in a crisis and devotes greater attention to the
“périphérie,” roughly, the flyover country, where a sense of abandonment has led
voters to reject mainstream parties. Viewed as a lame duck last year after a
succession of blunders, including an abrupt dissolution of Parliament that led to
chaos, Mr. Macron has reacquired a raison d’être.
Two recent polls, for the newspapers Le Figaro and JDD, showed Mr. Macron’s
popularity surging four percentage points, to nearly 30 percent, a respectable
showing in a country of strong egalitarian spirit, where scathing attacks on the
president are a national pastime and single-digit approval ratings are not
unknown.
Although he is term-limited and toward the end of his presidency, Mr. Macron has
assumed a more important role since President Trump took office because he is
widely seen in France and beyond as one of the most experienced orchestrators of
an effective European response to the new American distance from, and contempt
for, the continent. Mr. Macron’s quest for more contact, as in Thouars, forms part of
his push for a rebirth.
The once bustling Rue St.-Médard in the center of Thouars is now a procession of shuttered stores. Dmitry

“You know a barman has to be a psychologist, a confidant,” said Nicolas Cossard,
who works at Le Prem’s. “You listen to people newly widowed, to old people talking
about their gardens, their billiards, their Bingo, their car. Macron has been absent
for me. But when I shook his hand, my sense was he was not just trying to gain
credit.”
Alain Duhamel, the author of a book about Mr. Macron, said that the French
president had adjusted his style, if not his essence, to appear as “the sober rather
than the theatrical seducer.”
In Thouars, Mayor Paineau, who is also a successful entrepreneur, was alerted to
Mr. Macron’s visit when the president was already at the bar, so he rushed over,
delaying his appearance at a lunch for older people. On leaving Le Prem’s, Mr.
Macron insisted on accompanying the mayor to apologize for the delay. He stayed
through the meal.
“The band struck up the Marseillaise at the end, everyone rose, it was a moving
moment,” the mayor said. “He did not have to do that.”
Mr. Macron went on to visit Asselin, a local company that has provided beams for
the reconstruction of Notre-Dame Cathedral. Thouars is struggling but not
moribund.
At the bar, life goes on, albeit a little changed. An espresso is now known as a “petit
Macron.”
Mr. Jacques, warming to his role, said, “We are awaiting Putin next week.”

Lawyers for those deported say the March 15 operation circumvented due process
and swept up those who are not gang members. The Supreme Court is now poised
to weigh in on how the White House has sought to apply the Alien Enemies Act,
which had previously only been invoked by presidents in time of war.
A team of reporters from The New York Times reviewed court filings and
government documents and interviewed government officials and lawyers for
deportees and their relatives to reconstruct how the United States secured the deal
with El Salvador and seized on the law to supercharge its deportation efforts.
Here are five takeaways.’
5 Takeaways from The Times’s Examination of
the Salvadoran Prison Deal
El Salvador’s president pressed the U.S. for assurances that the
deportees had gang ties.
President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has championed President Trump and his
immigration agenda and publicly celebrated the arrival of the deportees from the
United States. But behind the scenes, Mr. Bukele expressed concern about whom
the United States sent to be imprisoned in his new Terrorism Confinement Center,
known as CECOT, according to according to people familiar with the situation and
documents obtained by The New York Times.
During the negotiations, Mr. Bukele told U.S. officials he would take only what he
described as “convicted criminals” from other countries. He made it clear that he
did not want migrants from other nations whose only crime was being in the
United States illegally.
Almost immediately after the deportations, a senior U.S. official told colleagues
that Mr. Bukele wanted evidence that all 238 Venezuelans sent to El Salvador were
members of Tren de Aragua, a transnational gang with roots in Venezuela, as the
Trump administration had promised.
U.S. officials rushed to provide Mr. Bukele with information they had compiled,
which included a scorecard in which each man was designated a gang member
based on points for certain affiliations and activities, such as having a range of
tattoos.
The scramble underscored the haphazard nature of the deportation operation and
deepened questions about whether the Trump administration sufficiently assessed
whom it sent to a prison designed for terrorists.
President Bukele sought specific MS-13 gang leaders as part of the
deal.
In return for opening the doors of his prison to Mr. Trump, Mr. Bukele had a
specific request: a list of Salvadoran MS-13 leaders he wanted released from U.S.
custody and sent back home, where he said they could be interrogated by his
security officers.
That request worried some law enforcement officials. In recent years, the Treasury
Department and Justice Department have accused Mr. Bukele’s government of
making a secret pact with MS-13, offering its leaders behind bars special privileges
to keep homicides down in El Salvador. Mr. Bukele has denied the claims.
Nevertheless, U.S. officials agreed to send El Salvador around a dozen senior
members of MS-13, including César Humberto López-Larios, who had been in U.S.
custody awaiting trial on narco-terrorism conspiracy charges. Mr. Bukele has so
far not received everyone he sought, but U.S. officials say they still intend to send
more of the gang leaders he requested.
Early on, Trump aides identified the Alien Enemies Act as a way
to speed deportations.
The Alien Enemies Act was passed in 1798, allowing the U.S. government to swiftly
deport citizens of an invading nation. The authority has been invoked just three
times in the past, all during times of war.
Long before he took office a second time, advisers to Mr. Trump identified the law
as a potentially powerful weapon to harness for immigration enforcement. The
reason: It gave the government the power to summarily expel people, without
normal due process.
The law “allows you to instantaneously remove any noncitizen foreigner from an
invading country, aged 14 or older,” Stephen Miller, now a top White House aide,
told the right-wing podcaster Charlie Kirk in a September 2023 interview, adding:
“That allows you to suspend the due process that normally applies to a removal
proceeding.”fi
The White House had confidence in its odds at the Supreme
Court.
On the day of the operation, the American Civil Liberties Union rushed to court to
try to halt the administration’s use of the wartime act to deport Venezuelan
migrants. Judge James E. Boasberg temporarily blocked the use of the law and
ordered any planes in the air to turn around.
At the time, two of the flights with deportees were in the air, en route to El
Salvador. A third plane had not yet taken off.
Inside the White House, senior administration officials quickly discussed the order
and whether they should move ahead. The team of Trump advisers decided to go
forward, believing the planes were safely in international airspace, and well aware
that the legal fight was most likely destined for the Supreme Court, where
conservatives have a majority.
Shortly afterward, the third flight took off. Officials would later say the migrants on
that flight were not deported under the Alien Enemies Act, but through regular
immigration proceedings.
The U.S. has paid El Salvador millions to imprison the deportees.
The White House initially said the United States paid El Salvador $6 million to jail
the Venezuelan deportees. Officials now say the payment amounted to less than $5
million.
Democratic lawmakers have sought more information, with little success. On
March 17, the State Department told the Senate Appropriations Committee that
sum could grow to $15 million, but refused to provide any additional details.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/trump-el-salvador-prison-deal-takeaways.html
José Bautista;Jenny Gross;John Yoon,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,Spain Searches for Answers on What Caused Power Blackout,"Two days after one of Europe’s worst blackouts in decades plunged tens of millions
of people across Spain and Portugal into darkness for up to 18 hours, officials from
both countries emerged from hourslong meetings and gave little indication publicly
that they were any closer to determining the cause.
“We are collecting thousands of data points from the energy system to shed light
on what happened,” Sara Aagesen, one of Spain’s vice presidents, said at a news
conference on Wednesday after Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain held two
meetings with senior officials in Madrid. She added, “We don’t know the cause,
which is why the investigation is essential.”
Neither the Spanish nor Portuguese government has publicly speculated on the
cause of the blackout, which began on Monday afternoon, leaving hospitals running
on generators, trains halted and supermarkets shut. Electricity was fully restored
by Tuesday morning. Parts of France were also briefly affected.
On Wednesday morning, Mr. Sánchez met with National Security Council officials
and then with the Council of Ministers at Moncloa Palace, the prime minister’s
residence in Madrid, to discuss the outage.
Spain and Portugal Look for Cause of
Widespread Blackout
Pilar Alegría, a spokeswoman for the Spanish government, said at the news
conference that Mr. Sánchez had set up a new committee to determine the cause
and ensure that a blackout would not happen again. Portuguese officials also said
the cause was still unknown.
The incident has raised questions about whether Spain and Portugal’s rapid shift to
renewable energy left them more vulnerable to outages. Ms. Aagesen, the vice
president, who is also the minister overseeing Spain’s ecological transition, on
Wednesday denied that the power outage had any connection to Spain’s rapid
expansion in renewable energy.
The Spanish government has not ruled out a cyberattack on the transmission grid,
even though Red Eléctrica, Spain’s grid operator, said there was no evidence of one.
A judge on Tuesday ordered Red Eléctrica, the intelligence service and the police to
produce reports within 10 days about whether a cyberattack was behind the power
outage, according to a court document. The National Cryptologic Center, which
oversees cyberthreats, was also reviewing Red Eléctrica’s online systems to
“ensure no hypothesis is ruled out,” Mr. Sánchez said.
There have been relatively few instances of disruption to electrical systems
because of cyberattacks; these issues are more commonly caused by equipment
failures, operational errors and effects of storms, according to the International
Energy Agency in Paris.
Hannah Christensen, a physics professor at the University of Oxford, said a stable
supply of electricity depends on equal amounts of energy flowing in and out of the
grid. It can be harder to balance flows in a system that depends on renewable
sources, she said.
If there is an imbalance, automatic mechanisms will take companies offline as a
precaution. “In the worst case scenario, you get these kind of cascading effects of
user after user disconnecting, and then the supply is massively larger than the
demand,” she said, adding that this could lead to blackouts.
After power was restored, Spain’s Interior Ministry on Tuesday downgraded many
regions from the highest of three alert levels to a medium one. Madrid and the
western region of Extremadura remained at the highest level on Wednesday, the
ministry said, because of disagreements between local and federal officials.
In Portugal, Prime Minister Luís Montenegro said after an emergency government
meeting on Tuesday that the outage was related to an abrupt increase in voltage in
the Spanish electricity grid, which activated safety mechanisms that led to the
blackout.
“We will calmly assess with the Spanish authorities what happened and try to
design better response instruments in the future to avoid a repeat of this
occurrence,” he said.
The outage is expected to be a key topic during a debate on Wednesday between
Mr. Montenegro and the opposition leader, Pedro Nuno Santos, ahead of a
parliamentary election on May 18. The two had originally been scheduled to debate
on Monday.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/europe/power-outage-spain-

Motoko Rich,NYT,1,World,5/3/2025,These Contentious Issues Could Determine Who Becomes the Next Pope,"The cardinals who have traveled to Rome to elect the next pope at a conclave next
week sometimes look as ideologically polarized as many secular voters around the
globe.
At first glance, they appear to split along the kinds of left-right lines that
characterize political contests elsewhere. Many conservative Roman Catholic
Church leaders disagreed with Pope Francis, who was often a darling of liberals
around the world.
But the typical divisions between progressives and conservatives don’t correspond
so neatly with the ideological battles within the Vatican and the broader church.
Although there are some exceptions among the cardinals, the issue that most
consistently marked Francis as a liberal — his fierce advocacy on behalf of
migrants and the poor — does not necessarily set him apart, because the Catholic
Church has made the gospel’s call to shelter and feed strangers a fundamental
tenet.
Ultimately, the cardinals’ choice will amount to a referendum on whether to extend
Francis’ legacy of inclusivity and openness to change. That was “how he made
sense of living in a highly polarized age,” said Anna Rowlands, a political theologian
at Durham University in England.
Francis understood “what’s at stake in the polarization,” said Professor Rowlands,
and was willing to accept disagreement as a precursor to dialogue. “The danger is
the church moves into a moment when it might be tempted to choose a pole,” she
said, which could close off discussion altogether.
More than any single issue, the choice of the next pontiff will be dominated by a
philosophical question: Who deserves a say in determining the Catholic Church’s
future?
Decision-Making
Francis often argued that regular practicing Catholics — including women and
L.G.B.T.Q. people — should be consulted about the direction of the church. He
invited lay people to sit with bishops to discuss controversial issues in Vatican
meetings called synods.
He was opposed by more conservative leaders, who may be keen to return to
centralized decision making. “I think the conversation will have to go along the
lines of, ‘Can we get away with doing away with it?’” said Miriam Duignan, the
executive director of the Wijngaards Institute for Catholic Research in Cambridge,
England.
Another key split is between those who believe the church should welcome
everyone — including those whose lives don’t match traditional church teachings
— and those who think that only those committed to unwavering Catholic doctrine
should be admitted into the church’s fold.
“It’s that big-tent vision of the church that is sometimes the source of tension and
apprehension,” said Rev. Agbonkhianmeghe E. Orobator, dean of the Jesuit School
of Theology at Santa Clara University. “It’s very different when you think of church
as a perfect society or closed society where membership is defined by doctrinal
allegiance or orthodoxy.”

Women in the Church
Two years ago, Francis for the first time allowed women to vote at a significant
meeting of bishops. Last year, he punted on a decision about whether women could
be ordained as deacons who can preach and preside over weddings, funerals and
baptisms.
Francis was clear that he wanted women to be permitted more options than “altar
girls or the president of a charity,” but resisted the notion that they needed to
participate in the church hierarchy. In many places with priest shortages, women
increasingly do the work of ministering to congregants.
Conservatives say that allowing women to be deacons would create a pathway for
them eventually to become priests. They argue that doing so would violate 2,000
years of church doctrine, despite what some experts say is historical evidence that
women acted as deacons in the early church.
Even if the ordination of women remains contentious among the cardinals, it would
be difficult to stifle the debate altogether because of pressure from female Catholic
activists.
Cardinal Tarcisio Isao Kikuchi, the archbishop of Tokyo, said in an interview last
month that he saw “nothing wrong with ordaining women as deacons.” But he said,
“there are still many problems that need to be overcome.”
Married Priests
The church has a dearth of priests in many countries. In 2019, a summit of Roman
Catholic bishops recommended that Francis allow married men to serve as priests
in the remote Amazon region, where the shortage is particularly acute.
A year later, Francis said he needed more time to consider the landmark proposal,
deciding that the church wasn’t yet ready to lift its roughly 1,000-year-old
restriction requiring priests to be single, celibate men. Many of his supporters who
expected him to be a pope of radical change felt let down.
Divorce
On the question of divorced and remarried Catholics, Francis urged priests not to
treat them like pariahs, and to welcome them with “doors wide open.”
Francis opened up the debate over whether to allow divorced and remarried
Catholics to receive communion even if they had not had their previous marriages
annulled by a church tribunal. But in the end, he backed off from any change in
church law and simply encouraged priests to be welcoming to divorced and
remarried Catholics.
“People who started a new union after the defeat of their sacramental marriage are
not at all excommunicated, and they absolutely must not be treated that way,”
Francis said. “Though their unions are contrary to the sacrament of marriage, the
church, as a mother, seeks the good and salvation of all her children.”
Sexual Orientation
Pope Francis ushered in a new era for L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics when in 2023 he
permitted priests to bless same-sex couples. He made clear that marriage was
reserved for relationships between a woman and a man, but his changes still
stoked the ire of conservatives, especially in Africa and North America.
In countries in Africa and other regions where homosexuality is a crime, Francis
explicitly condemned the criminalization but allowed bishops in Africa to forbid
priests to bless same-sex couples because of the danger to them if they were outed.
In cultures that stigmatized gay relationships, clergy would be given an “extended
period of pastoral reflection” to accept the new path that Francis always argued did
not contradict church teachings.

Sexual Abuse
Some among the church hierarchy might like to declare the crisis of sexual abuse
by Catholic priests over. But abuse survivors and activists warn that practices and
the mentality in local parishes have not changed enough to prevent future cases or
address the pain of existing ones.
A statement from the Vatican press office on Friday said the cardinals were
discussing sexual abuse in the church as a “‘wound’ to be kept ‘open’, so that
awareness of the problem remains alive and concrete paths for its healing can be
identified.”
The biggest revelations have been concentrated in the United States, Australia and
Europe. But in most of Asia, Africa and Latin America, “a lot has yet to come out, so
this will continue to rumble on,” said Miles Pattenden, a historian who studies the
Catholic Church at Oxford University.
The Global South
The biggest growth areas for the Catholic Church are in Africa and Asia. The
cardinals selecting the next pope are surely discussing whether to choose someone
from one of those regions. Whoever they elect will need to reckon with the
proliferation of cultures and traditions, as well as spiritual heritages, among new
followers. Some may come with different expectations of what role the faith plays
in their lives and how they should accommodate its rules.
Whether or not the new pope comes from those regions, he “must be one who is
ready to speak to the injustices that exist in relationship between the global north
and the global south in international politics,” said Nora Kofognotera Nonterah, a
theological ethicist at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in
Ghana. “A pope cannot run away from that in the 21st century.”
As the church recruits new followers, it will also need to find a way to speak to its
youngest members. “Young people are no longer interested in taking directives
and working with directives,” Dr. Nonterah said. “They want to ask questions and
they want to be asked questions.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/world/europe/pope-conclave-contentious-issues.html

Updated April 21, 2025
When Thierno Agne was a student casting about for a lucrative career, he told his
agriculture professor he was considering growing strawberries in Senegal.
“You will fail,” he remembered the professor warning.
He didn’t listen, and now, at 36, Mr. Agne runs one of the biggest strawberry farms
in the country.
He had not even wanted to be a farmer. He had started his higher education by
studying law. But then, he shocked his family by switching to agriculture when he
realized there were already more law graduates in Senegal than there were jobs
available.

Still, despite the glut of legal graduates, his shift in focus was an unusual move for
an ambitious young man in a country where farming is seen as a job for old,
uneducated or poor people.
Mr. Agne has shown, however, that farming can be a profession that requires
education, commands as much respect and remuneration as a lawyer, and
demands as much innovation as any high-tech entrepreneur is expected to show.
On a recent morning at his farm just outside Dakar, the capital, Mr. Agne quietly
trod the rows of vibrant strawberry plants, checking how his delicate crop was
doing.
This crop would be sold in Dakar supermarkets and by roadside vendors — part of
Mr. Agne’s mission to turn what was recently a luxury treat into an everyday fruit.
A strawberry-growing plot of land at FraiSen — the name of Mr. Agne’s company, which is short for
Fraise Sénégalaise, or Senegalese Strawberry.

“We want to demystify the idea that strawberries are not for Africans,” Mr. Agne
said on his farm. “That they can be grown here, sold here, and locals, especially our
kids, should enjoy them.”
His mission just got harder. Until recently, he received support from the U.S.
Agency for International Development to hire seasonal staff and train people to
expand strawberry production in Senegal. That assistance was terminated in
February as part of the Trump administration’s gutting of the aid agency.
But students are still coming to the farm in Bayakh, a village in the Thiès region.
Strawberries are the favorite fruit of Rama Diane, 16, a student from Dakar who
recently visited one of Mr. Agne’s farms. But she hadn’t eaten one in a whole year.
Standing on the edge of a field full of them, she and her classmates were eager for a
taste. Ms. Diane popped one in her mouth and immediately started making
comparisons to the one she had last year.
“It wasn’t as sweet,” she said of last year’s berry. “I guess it was imported.”
The unique taste of his locally grown strawberries is a point of pride for Mr. Agne.
He is hoping to ultimately end strawberry imports, which currently account for
about 80 percent of Senegal’s consumption. But he is also determined to
demonstrate that farming can be a source of good jobs in a country where they’re
acutely scarce — 20 percent of young people are unemployed in Senegal.

which currently account for about 80 percent of Senegal’s consumption.

thanks to domestic crops, they are still a luxury for many.
Farming can also keep young people at home, he said, instead of pouring out of the
country by the thousands every year, often risking dangerous routes for
opportunities in Europe and the United States.
U.S.A.I.D. had been helping with goals like these.
In Senegal, where the agency spent $27 million last year, the dismantling of such
support will make young people feel hopeless and will fuel illegal migration,
according to Mr. Agne.
Several young people he mentored had been considering migrating to the United
States through a circuitous route via Nicaragua, but he managed to change their
minds. A big part of his pitch was the success that he had managed to find in
Senegal — and that he had a valid American visa but was too busy and satisfied at
home to want to cross the Atlantic with it.
Mr. Agne grew up outdoors and around agriculture, tending — and often singing to
— his father’s mango trees. But he never thought his future would be in fruit
production.
“It was fun,” he said, smiling as he reminisced about his emotional bond with his
father’s banana and mango plants.
But he saw his career path far from the fields of his hometown, Tambacounda. He
wanted to be a lawyer and follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, a respected
imam and colonial-era Muslim jurist.
Mr. Agne’s beloved grandfather was not only a Muslim jurist, but also a big-time farmer, who supplied
millet and corn to the French forces during World War II.
Before Mr. Agne started FraiSen, the production of strawberries on a commercial scale was unheard-of in
Senegal.
After completing his secondary-level education, he hopped a train to Dakar, which
he knew of only by the tales of its beauty, vibrant life and allure of opportunities.
“It was my first time ever leaving Tambacounda,” he said. “I got lost, and I didn’t
have enough money.”
A few days later, Mr. Agne showed up at Cheikh Anta Diop University and enrolled
in a law program.
But when one of his professors told him that more than 2,000 recent graduates
from the law school still did not have jobs, he was bitterly disappointed.
Dejected, he went back to his hometown, worrying about his prospects. But on that
trip home, he learned for the first time that his beloved grandfather had been not
only a jurist, but also a major farmer who supplied millet and corn to French forces
during World War II, earning medals and French citizenship.
Upon returning to Dakar, he abandoned his law program and signed up to study
agriculture.
The decision divided his family. “Some thought I was mad,” he said.
On a recent morning, Mr. Agne welcomed over 60 students from a Senegalese
school, and as he explained the science he had applied to grow strawberries
against the odds, the biology teacher who brought the students started nodding
along.
The teacher, Alieu Bah, said his students picture farming as something the poor do.
“I want them to change that perception,” he said.

Mr. Agne explaining how to pick the berry to the visiting high school students.
It was harvest season, and such organized visits to Mr. Agne’s farms were frequent.
With the earth softened by recent watering, the delighted students ran wild
through the fields, picking ripe strawberries.
“I am so, so excited to be here,” Rama said, adding that it was her first visit to a
farm, and even more thrilling, it was a strawberry farm.
Before Mr. Agne started FraiSen — the name of his company, which is short for
Fraise Sénégalaise, or Senegalese Strawberry — the berry’s production on a
commercial scale was unheard-of in Senegal. The West African country’s hot and
humid climate and erratic rains were simply not suitable for it, many thought.
Mr. Agne himself was 22 when he first saw strawberries, on a school exchange in
France.
Until then, the main crop he had seen was peanuts, Senegal’s primary export crop,
and millet, a grain grown for local consumption.
So what drove him to embrace such an unexpected crop?
“It’s sexy,” he said, as he moved in between rows of the berry on his sun-drenched
farm. “It’s different.”
He began his experiment by planting a few strawberries on his balcony in Dakar,
and they thrived. He then rented a 2,150-square-foot plot for $250 to begin
commercial operations. He earned nearly $6,000 with his first crop in 2015.
His second year, after scaling up to a little over 5,000 square feet, he profited
around $13,000. That gave him the confidence to expand further, to 2.5 acres. But
then his plants spoiled midway through the growing season.
Mr. Agne, left, preparing trays of strawberries for distribution.
The unique taste of his locally grown strawberries is a point of pride for Mr. Agne.
“I guess I was overambitious,” he admitted. “Now, I take things step by step.”
Eight years after that hard lesson, Mr. Agne now cultivates a total of 12 acres on
three fields, producing 50 tons of strawberries annually. His plan is to acquire a 50-
acre field next year, which would put him into a small circle of large-scale
agricultural producers in Senegal, where 95 percent of farms are small, mostly
subsistence holdings.
He has trained hundreds of young people over the years, some of whom have
become strawberry farmers, and others who process the strawberries into juice.
“There are now 50 of us,” he said, referring to an association of strawberry farmers
he created. “Together, we produce 180 tons every year.”
With this homegrown production, strawberries are now cheaper in Senegal’s
groceries and even sold by hawkers on the streets. But at $9 to $11 per kilogram (a
little over two pounds), they’re still unaffordable for many.
As the visiting students left, each holding a box of strawberries, Mr. Agne inspected
his plants, which miraculously survived the stomping.
“I am proud of what I have achieved,” he said. “I have put my country on the map
of strawberry producers.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/world/africa/senegal-strawberry-farmer-profile.html
Farnaz Fassihi,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,"U.N. Orders Agencies to Find Budget Cuts, Including via Staff Moves From N.Y.","The United Nations, anticipating that President Trump will slash U.S. contributions
to the global body, has told its departments to draw up plans for budget cuts,
including through staff relocations from New York and Geneva to less-expensive
cities.
The instructions — outlined in a two-page memo dated April 25 that was reviewed
by The New York Times — were sent from Secretary General António Guterres’s
office to the heads of all agencies that report directly to him. The memo set a May
15 deadline for all proposals so that they could be added to the 2026 budget.
“Your objective is to identify as many functions as possible that could be relocated
to existing lower-cost locations,” the memo reads, “or otherwise reduced or
abolished if they are duplicative or no longer viable.”
U.N. Orders Agencies to Find Budget Cuts,
Including via Staff Relocations From N.Y.

In February, President Trump signed an executive order calling for a review of the
overall U.S. funding and ties to the U.N. He withdrew the United States from
several U.N. organizations, including those dealing with human rights, women’s
reproductive rights, climate change, Palestinian aid and global health. In his first
term, he also reduced U.S. contributions to peacekeeping efforts.
Three senior U.N. officials said on Tuesday that the drastic, cost-cutting measures
laid out in the memo had caught the agency’s departments by surprise and went
beyond what they had expected. The officials, who requested anonymity because
they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the directive was largely viewed as
a way for the U.N. to brace for potential additional cuts by Mr. Trump and to
proactively insulate it from the financial blow.
But the U.N. officials said the budget cuts were ordered only partly in response to
Mr. Trump’s moves. The directive comes as the U.N. is adjusting to a host of
financial problems, they said, from the withdrawal and reduction in financial
contributions by major donors like the United States and Europe to a cash-flow
crisis caused by member states’ not paying their annual dues on time and in full.
Mr. Guterres announced on March 12 that he was launching an initiative called
UN80 — named for the organization’s 80th anniversary — to create cost-effective
measures and improve efficiency across the organization.
“These are times of intense uncertainty and unpredictability,” Mr. Guterres said at
the time. “Resources are shrinking across the board — and they have been for a
long time.”
He also said that a reduction in funding from the United States and other countries
had “naturally led to the need by the agencies that deliver those services to reduce
staff, to shrink their dimension and to eliminate many activities.”
Stéphane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, said the April 25 memo had resulted from
the UN80 initiative.
Richard Gowan, the U.N. director for the International Crisis Group, said that while
the U.N. was portraying the moves as an internal overhaul, in reality, they had
resulted from pressure by and anxiety about the Trump administration.
“The U.S. cuts, the range of the cuts and scale of the cuts have really shocked the
U.N.,” Mr. Gowan said in an interview. “So Guterres is now frankly racing to catch
up with a very bad situation.”
The United States is the largest contributor to the U.N., accounting for nearly 25
percent of its overall budget, which in 2024 amounted to about $3.6 billion and went
toward administrative and peacekeeping needs. America is also a major donor to
various U.N. agencies for humanitarian relief work; in 2022, the United States
contributed about $18 billion to the U.N. across the board.
Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden also have announced deep cuts in
international aid, including to the U.N., in order to focus on domestic needs and
defense priorities. China, a major contributor to the U.N., has traditionally stepped
up funding toward programs that align with its own interests, like peacekeeping.
Now, the U.N. estimates it would face a 20 percent budget reduction for 2026 as a
result of funding cuts, according to Mr. Gowan, which would amount to billions of
dollars in losses.
Some agencies, including UNICEF and the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs, said they had already begun cost-cutting reviews separate
from the Guterres directive.
A senior official at UNICEF said the agency was anticipating at least a 20 percent
budget decrease for 2026. UNICEF is also considering relocating a sizable portion
of its staff to Valencia, Spain, from New York, the senior official said. The goal, he
added, was to ensure any budget shortfall would have as little effect as possible on
programs that serve children.
UNICEF is funded through donations from member states, the private sector and
individuals. It does not receive money from the U.N.’s overall budget.
Even before the memo was sent, Mr. Guterres said last month that the U.N.’s
Population Fund, which focuses on women’s health and reproductive rights, would
move its entire operation to Nairobi, Kenya, from New York.

Who will attend Pope Francis’s funeral?
Here’s who is planning to be in Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, including President Donald
Trump, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other world leaders.
Updated Vatican officials say leaders from all over the world are planning to attend Pope Francis’s funeral, including 50 heads
of state, 10 reigning sovereigns and 130 national delegations.
Here’s a look at who is expected to attend.
President Donald Trump
Trump, who had clashed with Francis during his first and second terms in the White House, said Monday that he
and first lady Melania Trump will be in attendance.
“We look forward to being there!” he wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, before the Vatican confirmed
the date of the funeral.
In 2005, then-President George W. Bush attended the funeral of Pope John Paul II, along with former president Bill
Clinton.
Former president Joe Biden
Biden and former first lady Jill Biden will attend Francis’s funeral in Rome, according to a spokesperson for the
former president and the Vatican. Biden, who is Catholic, was scheduled to meet with Francis during the final days
of his presidency but canceled the trip due to wildfires in California.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer
World
A spokesperson for 10 Downing Street confirmed that the British leader was planning to be at the funeral, after
praising Francis on Monday as a “pope for the poor, the downtrodden and the forgotten.”
President Emmanuel Macron
Speaking to reporters while traveling overseas, Macron said he would be in attendance, “as expected.” Macron had
met with Francis several times over his presidency, most recently at the end of last year in Corsica.
President Volodymyr Zelensky
The Ukrainian president confirmed that he would be traveling to Vatican City with Ukraine’s first lady, Olena
Zelenska, on Saturday for the funeral. Francis had been outspoken in calling for peace in Ukraine. The two leaders
met several times after Russia’s ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine, most recently in October.
President Javier Milei
The president of Argentina, where Francis was born and grew up, announced a week-long period of mourning.
Although Milei had been harshly critical of Francis in the past, he expressed his grief Monday, saying their
differences now seemed “minor.”
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva
Brazil’s president had known Francis for many years, according to the Vatican’s news agency. He also declared a
week-long period of mourning in the country.
President Daniel Noboa
Ecuador’s president will attend with a delegation, according to local outlets. The country’s foreign minister, Gabriela
Sommerfeld, was among several officials who wrote farewell messages to Francis earlier this week at the Apostolic
Nunciature in the country’s capital, where Francis had once stayed.
Prince William
The Prince of Wales will attend Francis’s funeral on behalf of his father, King Charles III, according to Kensington
Palace. Charles and Queen Camilla met privately with Francis in Italy this month.
King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia
The monarchs of Spain, a highly Catholic nation, said they would attend, according to local media — their first papal
funeral after Felipe’s mother went to Benedict XVI’s funeral in 2023.
Governor General Mary Simon
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is Catholic, said he would not be able to attend, with the country’s
federal elections Monday. But he said Simon and a senior government delegation would be there on behalf of the
country.
President Andrzej Duda
The president of Poland will attend Francis’s funeral with his wife, according to a statement from his office.
Al-Azhar
A delegation from the leading Sunni Islamic institution will be led by the Grand Imam Sheikh Ahmed El-Tayyeb,
according Egypt’s state-run news agency, MENA. Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, expressed his condolences
Monday, calling the pope “an exemplary model of devotion to noble values.”
An Australian delegation
Neither Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who is Catholic, nor Australia’s opposition leader, Peter Dutton, will be
attending ahead of the country’s federal elections next week. Albanese said he would send several other government
officials, including Governor General Sam Mostyn; Australia’s ambassador to the Holy See, Keith Pitt; and its trade
minister, Don Farrell.
E.U. leaders
The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the European Council president, António
Costa, are set to travel to Rome, their offices said.
Members of the Catholic Church
Some of the 135 cardinal electors who will choose the next pope will also help lead Francis’s funeral Saturday.
Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell, the Vatican camerlengo, will lead a prayer at the chapel of Casa Santa Marta before a
funeral procession to St. Peter’s. The dean of the college of cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re of Italy, will
preside over a public Mass on Saturday.
U.N. Secretary General António Guterres
The U.N. secretary general plans to attend the funeral Saturday, Stéphane Dujarric, a Guterres spokesperson, said
Thursday. Guterres called Francis “a messenger of hope, humility and humanity” in a post on X following the
announcement of the pope’s death.
President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
The president of the Philippines, a country that is nearly 80 percent Roman Catholic, will attend the funeral along
with first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos, his office said in a statement. Marcos Jr. declared a period of national mourning
this week until the burial of the pope Saturday, with flags flying at half-staff on all government buildings throughout
the country and abroad.
Yaron Sideman
Israel’s ambassador to the Holy See will attend Francis’s funeral, despite some apparent tension between Israel and
the Vatican. According to Israeli media, the country’s minister of foreign affairs recently deleted its original social
media post about Francis’s death, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office posted a terse statement
expressing condolences several days after Francis died (Israel’s president wrote a longer statement about Francis on
Monday). Francis had been outspoken in criticizing Israel’s conduct in Gaza, having called for an investigation into
whether Israel’s attacks met the legal definition of genocide.
Other global leaders
Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said it would send an envoy.
The Kremlin’s chief spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said President Vladimir Putin did not plan to attend, according to
Russia’s Tass news agency. China’s Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that it had “no information” available about plans
for a delegation.

Dan Balz;Scott Clement;Emily Guskin,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/27/2025,Trump’s approval rating sinks in new Washington Post-ABC-Ipsos poll,"As he nears the end of his first 100 days in office, President Donald Trump is facing growing opposition to his
ambitious and controversial agenda, with his approval rating in decline, majority opposition to major initiatives, and
perceptions that his administration is seeking to avoid complying with federal court orders, according to a Washington
Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll.
No president in modern times has moved more swiftly than Trump to remake so many parts of government, as well as
some outside institutions. The moves range from shrinking and reshaping the executive branch to upending the global
economic order to cracking down on illegal immigration to challenging leading universities.
The initiatives have caused significant disruption to individuals, institutions and financial markets. They have
produced a flurry of lawsuits from opponents, which Trump is contesting. There are few bright spots in the survey for
the president, and none of his policies tested in the poll enjoy majority support.
Trump’s overall approval rating is lower than it was only two months ago. The poll shows that 39 percent of adult
Americans approve of the way Trump is handling his job, compared with 55 percent who disapprove, including 44
percent who disapprove strongly. In February, those numbers were 45 percent positive and 53 percent negative.

positive marks, compared with 51 percent negative. Today those numbers are 42 percent positive and 55 percent
negative, a swing from net negative three percentage points to net negative 13 points.
Trump’s approval rating is lower than for any past president at the 100-day mark in their first or second terms. At a
similar point in their first terms as president, 42 percent approved of Trump and 52 percent approved of President Joe
Biden. Most presidents enjoy a honeymoon during their first months in office, only to see their ratings decline later in
the first year. Trump may be an exception.

Trump has seen a decline of 10 points among White people without a college degree, a key part of his political coalition;
he is also down 13 points among adults under age 30 and 11 points among those who say they did not vote in
November.
For the most part, Trump is holding on to support from his Republican base, including many who say federal judges
are trying to interfere with his legal authority. On one big policy, most Americans say they think Trump’s tariffs will
create more manufacturing jobs in the United States, as he has predicted, even if they see the tariffs as raising prices.
The findings suggest that the president has overinterpreted the meaning of his victory over former vice president
Kamala Harris by pursuing policies that have generated dissatisfaction from the public. In broad strokes, the judgment
of his presidency so far is that a majority think Trump has exceeded his authority, a majority say the economy is worse
and about half say that U.S. leadership in the world has become weaker. The economy, once a clear attribute for
Trump, has become one more source of public disapproval about his presidency.
For all the negative findings related to the president’s actions, the poll offers little comfort for Democrats. Americans
trust Trump over congressional Democrats by 37 percent to 30 percent when it comes to dealing with the country’s
major problems — another 30 percent trust “neither” — and see the Democratic Party as somewhat more out of touch
“with the concerns of most people” than either the president or the Republican Party.

There is a significant partisan split on rating the president — and on virtually everything else in the survey. More than 9
in 10 Democrats disapprove of the way Trump is doing his job while more than 8 in 10 Republicans approve. But 15
percent of Republicans give him negative marks, marginally more than did so eight years ago, when 10 percent of
Republicans said they disapproved of his work at the 100-day mark. Last November, Trump captured 94 percent of
Republicans’ votes, according to exit polls.
In the survey, independents, a group Trump narrowly lost in November, break heavily to the negative, with 33 percent
approving and 58 percent disapproving. Among independents who lean Republican, Trump’s approval has dropped
from 76 percent to 63 percent since February.
On specific issues, more than 6 in 10 disapprove of his handling of the economy, U.S. relations with other countries,
applying tariffs to imported goods and his navigation of the recent turmoil in financial markets. Smaller majorities
disapprove of his management of the federal government and the way he is looking out for average Americans. Even on
immigration, the president’s signature issue, 53 percent disapprove of the way he is handling things, though there are
elements of his policies that do enjoy support.

Most Americans say the president is “going too far” trying to expand the power of the presidency, in laying off

diversity in the government and private workplaces, while 48 percent say he has gone too far with his policies to deport
undocumented immigrants. Half say Trump is handling these deportations about right or “not going far enough.”

One of the biggest clashes has been between the administration and Harvard University. The administration has

Trump won the election last year largely on the issues of immigration and the economy. On the economy, many viewed
him as a better steward than either Biden or Harris, and his economic ratings were generally positive during his first
term in office. That is not the case today.
Today, his economic approval rating is 39 percent positive and 61 percent negative. That compares with 45 percent
positive and 53 percent negative only two months ago, before he announced the bulk of his tariffs on nations around
the world. His disapproval is the highest recorded for Trump in a Post-ABC poll and his approval is the lowest
recorded. Notably, his approval on the economy is only two points better than Biden’s 37 percent roughly a year ago.
Overall, more than 7 in 10 Americans say the economy today is either “not so good” or “poor,” identical to findings in
February. Despite the absence of change in the general assessment of the economy, a majority (53 percent) say the
economy has grown worse since Trump took office in January.
In December, 62 percent of swing-state voters predicted Trump would do an excellent or good job handling the
economy, his best issue in that Post-Schar School poll. Almost half expected his presidency to help their personal
finances (46 percent), while 31 percent expected their finances to suffer. In the new poll, about half say their financial
situation is about the same as it was when Trump took office in January, while roughly 4 in 10 say they are worse off
and 1 in 10 say they are better off.
Looking ahead, more than 7 in 10 say they think Trump’s policies will result in an economic recession in the short term,
including 51 percent of Republicans. Looking further into the future, barely 3 in 10 think Trump’s policies will put the
U.S. on a stronger economic foundation.

Americans see a president who is seeking to expand his authority and flouting the rule of law. A near majority (49
percent) say he is moving the country away from its founding principles, compared with about one-third who say he is
moving the country closer to those principles.
More than 6 in 10 say the Trump administration does not respect the rule of law, and more than half say the
administration is not committed to protecting the rights and freedoms of Americans. Six in 10 say the president, since
taking office, has gone beyond his authority, and 56 percent say those actions are not justified.
Trump and administration lawyers have clashed with federal judges repeatedly in recent weeks, and in this area the
public sides with the judges rather than the administration. Two in 3 say judges should have the authority to block a
policy until a trial is held if they think the policy will harm people and is illegal.
More than 6 in 10 say they think federal judges are trying to enforce existing limits on Trump’s authority, compared
with slightly more than 1 in 3 who say these judges are trying to interfere with the president’s authority. And about
two-thirds say they think the administration is trying to avoid complying with court orders.

Naftali Bendavid,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/27/2025,Democrats seize on a new issue to use against the GOP: Social Security,"Democrats, after weeks of struggling to find a message that resonates with ordinary Americans while President Donald
Trump dominates the news, are beginning to settle on one: the allegation that Trump and his allies are crippling Social
Security.
Former president Joe Biden used his first public comments since leaving office to criticize Trump’s handling of the
popular program. Early Democratic ads are targeting Republican senators on Social Security. Democrats have visited
Social Security offices around the country, sometimes getting turned away and going public. Senate Democrats have set
up a “war room” to deliver the message.
Democrats say there is evidence that the push is working. Rep. Marilyn Strickland (D-Washington) reported having
more than 22,000 constituents on a recent tele-town hall on Social Security. Martin O’Malley, a former Maryland
governor who served as Social Security commissioner toward the end of Biden’s term, has drawn crowds to town halls
in Florida and elsewhere.
“For much of the country, Washington might as well be Mars for all the connection it has to them,” Sen. Ron Wyden
(Oregon), the top Democrat on the committee that oversees Social Security, said in an interview. “But Social Security is
something where there is connective tissue between the government and the people.”
The elimination of 7,000 Social Security jobs — more than 12 percent of the workforce — and other cuts have led to
long waits, dropped calls and other widespread service issues. Democrats say the worsening problems create a clear
link between Trump’s chaotic style and Americans’ day-to-day well-being.
Michael Astrue, who led the Social Security Administration under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama —
and says he voted for Trump — sharply criticized cuts to the agency by Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service, which stands
for Department of Government Efficiency.
“I think you have a group of very immature people coming out of Silicon Valley bro culture, and they have decided
federal agencies are filled with bad people doing bad things, and if you go in and hack away, and you don’t have to
know what you are doing, you can improve it because less is more,” Astrue said.
More than 73 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, spanning all states and districts. It is the
government’s marquee program for elderly and disabled people, so beneficiaries are concentrated among older
Americans, who vote in high proportions. Voters 65 and up narrowly backed Trump 50 percent to 49 percent in
November.
That sets it apart from other vulnerable programs, O’Malley said. “Unlike some other things that our federal
government does, however important, whether Medicare or Medicaid or USAID or Department of Education, each of
those requires a lot more explanation for people than Social Security,” he said. “If you get Social Security, then you ‘get’
Social Security. Nobody has to explain to you that you have earned the benefit.”
Trump officials have a very different view, saying the cuts of thousands of staffers amount to a long-overdue attack on
waste and fraud.
Musk has called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme,” saying the money coming in is not enough to meet its future
obligations. Both Musk and Trump have suggested that millions of Social Security checks are fraudulently going to
people listed as 100 or older, although that claim has been widely debunked.
The White House says Trump is improving the program by modernizing technology and requiring employees to be in
the office five days a week. Any eligible American will continue to receive their benefits, officials said.
“Democrats care more about illegal immigrants than their own constituents, especially seniors, and their fake concern
deceives no one,” said White House spokeswoman Liz Huston. “President Trump will fiercely protect Social Security,
eliminate unfair benefit taxes to boost seniors’ take-home pay, and drive the Social Security Administration to
modernize systems, enhance customer service, and combat fraud.”
Audits have found minimal fraud in Social Security, generally concluding that less than 1 percent of its payments are
improper and many of those are easily fixed.
Since Musk and DOGE began cutting Social Security staff earlier this year, The Washington Post has documented
website crashes, lengthy wait times and improper handling of sensitive data. Trump officials have classified live
immigrants as dead people and developed plans to force millions of customers to file in person rather than over the
phone. Some of these moves have been reversed after a backlash.
Few would dispute that Social Security faces financial challenges, as Americans live longer and the birth rate falls to
historic lows. A recent report from the program’s trustees concluded that by 2033, Social Security’s old-age fund will be
able to pay only 79 percent of benefits.
The proposed fixes, however, vary widely. Democrats want to lift the cap on Social Security taxes, noting that
Americans now pay them only on the first $176,100 of their earnings. Conservatives, in contrast, favor funneling those
taxes into private investment accounts, saying that would yield far more money for beneficiaries.
Romina Boccia, director of budget and entitlement policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, said Musk is not entirely
wrong to compare Social Security to a Ponzi scheme. The main difference, Boccia said, is that payroll taxes guarantee
an inflow of money, unlike in a traditional Ponzi scheme where the cash can simply dry up.
Democrats are fearmongering, she said — but Republicans are trumpeting a nonexistent fraud problem. “The
Democrats are basically scaring seniors while Republicans are shouting about fraud,” Boccia said. “But neither party is
willing to tell the truth about Social Security’s math.”
The White House has shown uncharacteristic concern that the Democratic message on Social Security could resonate.
The president has made clear to top aides that he does not like seeing the agency in the news so often and so negatively,
one senior Social Security official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk about a sensitive issue.
On Tuesday, the administration said it is reinstating an annual “National Social Security Month” in April to promote
awareness. On April 15 — the day Biden gave a speech accusing Trump of threatening the program — the White House
released a prebuttal reiterating Trump’s support for it.
But Democrats are continuing to press what they see as an advantage.
Earlier this month, Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-New Mexico) stopped by the Social Security office in Albuquerque,
where she said she had an appointment with the regional manager. As she waited, she said, she heard an instruction on
a security radio not to let in the “unauthorized persons.”
After a 40-minute wait, an officer emerged and handed her a small slip of paper with the number for the Dallas
regional office. “The whole thing was so bizarre,” said Stansbury, who posted a video of herself outside the
Albuquerque office.
The problems are widespread, she added. “People are calling the Social Security office, getting hold wait times of four,
six hours, and when they finally get through they are told they have to go to an office they can’t get to,” Stansbury said.
“People on Social Security are elderly. They may not be able to drive. They may have health conditions.”
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has released digital ads targeting Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and
Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina). They feature the sound of a phone ringing repeatedly and a message that on Social
Security, Republicans “don’t care if you get left hanging.”
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts) and other Democrats launched a Social Security “war room” several weeks ago.
“Elon Musk makes $8 million a day from the federal government, and he wants to take away the $65 a day that the
average Social Security recipient gets,” Warren said at the launch. “This is really ugly.”
In the House, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) has also made the issue a priority, speaking about it on
Fox News and staging a “day of action” for Democrats across the country.
Some Republicans are signaling that they are sensitive to the issue. At a March 25 confirmation hearing on Trump’s
pick for Social Security chief, Frank Bisignano, Sen. Steve Daines (R-Montana) said he had dispatched one of his
staffers to call the agency’s help line to see how it was working.
The staffer was disconnected three times, he said. Daines even played the hold music for his colleagues, joking, “They
should have at least had Olivia Newton-John or some mediocre ’70s music.” He added, “We’ve got a lot of work to do to
serve the taxpayers in this country and improve their customer experience.”
The administration stresses that it has not permanently closed any Social Security field offices. Democrats have
criticized DOGE for listing numerous planned field office closures on its website, only to quietly remove them as
criticism mounted.
Trump made clear early in his political career that he recognized the perils of criticizing Social Security. After
Republicans spent decades floating various plans to overhaul or privatize it, Trump in contrast promised to protect the
program, saying at a rally in July: “I will not cut one penny from Social Security or Medicare.” But Trump and
administration officials have repeatedly characterized that promise as applying only to benefits, not to cutting staff or
customer service spending.
Other GOP candidates have followed Trump’s lead. “That was a shift for Republicans,” said Kathleen Romig, a Social
Security official under George W. Bush, Obama and Biden. “For 10 years he seemed to understand the political folly of
messing with Social Security. And here they are touching the stove.”
Many Republicans have painful memories of Bush’s campaign to revamp the program in 2005, which backfired badly.
Fresh from a decisive reelection victory, Bush embraced a plan to let younger workers invest part of their Social
Security taxes in private accounts, touting the idea in his State of the Union address and barnstorming the country.
But the idea proved deeply unpopular with voters, and even Republican lawmakers began distancing themselves from
it. The following year, the GOP lost the House and Senate in a historic rout, and many analysts say the Social Security
fight at least played a role.
Trump and other Republicans now say they simply want to improve efficiency at Social Security and have no plan for
far-reaching changes. But Musk’s disparagement of the program and the GOP’s history of embracing proposals to
retool it has made that message more challenging, and some Democrats say the unsupported fraud claims are a prelude
to dismantling it.
“Because the public program is so broadly supported by Americans across the political system, they can’t really rob it
until they wreck it,” O’Malley said. “So all those patently false allegations about the agency being rife with fraud, about
the agency itself being a fraud, about illegal immigrants milking it dry — they need to wreck its reputation.”",NA
Lauren Kaori Gurley,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/25/2025,Judge blocks Trump executive order gutting federal unions,"A federal judge Friday afternoon temporarily blocked the Trump administration from invalidating union contracts for
hundreds of thousands of federal employees, the latest in a string of legal setbacks for the president this week.
U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman of the District of Columbia said President Donald Trump’s March directive
stripping federal workers at dozens of agencies of their union rights was unlawful, in an order granting a temporary
injunction.
“An opinion explaining the Court’s reasoning will be issued within the next few days,” Friedman, an appointee of
President Bill Clinton, wrote.
Trump’s executive order from late March canceled union rights at more than two dozen federal agencies and offices, in
a major expansion of the administration’s efforts to shrink the federal government. The White House cited national
security concerns for terminating workers’ ability to bargain collectively, but the order applied to federal agencies with
both direct and indirect links to national security.
Those include most or all of the Departments of Treasury, Defense, Veterans Affairs, State and Justice, and parts of
Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, Interior, Energy and Commerce, among others.
Public sector unions have been aggressive in fighting efforts by the U.S. DOGE Service, started by billionaire Trump
adviser Elon Musk, to cut federal spending and shed government workers, bringing lawsuits in multiple courts that
have halted plans to fire employees.
Union advocates and labor experts have said Trump’s order represents a major escalation in the administration’s
campaign to shrink the federal workforce, a drive that began on Trump’s first day in office with an order ending remote
work.
In a statement, Doreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which filed the lawsuit, called
the order “a victory for federal employees, their union rights and the American people they serve.”
“The collective bargaining rights of federal employees will remain intact and the administration’s unlawful agenda to
silence the voices of federal employees and dismantle unions is blocked,” Greenwald said.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump invoked his authority under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 to cancel the union contracts, taking a
sweeping view of what constitutes national security. The administration also moved to end union rights for workers at
the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Communications Commission and the National Science Foundation,
among many other agencies.
The order excluded police and firefighter unions. Law enforcement unions were the only ones who endorsed Trump in
the 2024 election.
Public sector unions represent about 1.25 million workers in the federal government’s 2.3 million-person bureaucracy,
according to Labor Department data.",NA
Victoria Craw,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,5/1/2025,Brooke Bellamy accused of cookbook plagiarism. Can you own a recipe?,"Caramel, baklava and vanilla cake are not supposed to taste this sour. A rising star in the baking world has been
accused of plagiarism for her version of three classic dishes in her first cookbook, sparking online outcry and raising
questions about whether it’s possible to ever “own” a recipe.
The case is the latest copyright allegation in the food industry, where chefs and influencers tread a delicate line
between blending the necessary steps to make food with innovations to create something to be repeated and shared.
The allegations
On Tuesday, Australian food writer Nagi Maehashi, of the popular food website RecipeTin Eats, accused bakery owner
and influencer Brooke Bellamy of using two of her recipes — for caramel slice, a classic Australian recipe layering
chocolate and caramel atop a biscuit base, and baklava — in her first cookbook, “Bake with Brooki.”
Maehashi, who has published two cookbooks, also accused Bellamy’s publisher, Penguin Random House Australia, of
copyright infringement, and published side-by-side pictures of her and Bellamy’s recipes. The company’s lawyers
rejected the allegations, Maehashi said. Neither Penguin Random House Australia, Maehashi nor Maehashi’s lawyers
responded to requests for comment.
“This is a story about a multi-million dollar cookbook by a social media influencer, published by a blue-chip publisher,
featuring numerous recipes that, in my opinion, are plagiarised, given the detailed and extensive word-for-word
similarities to mine and those of other authors,” Maehashi wrote.
The plagiarism claims were echoed by U.S. baker Sally McKenney, author of Sally’s Baking Addiction, who wrote on
Instagram that her vanilla cake recipe had been “plagiarized in this book.” Maehashi said she recognized McKenney’s
cake because of its unusual use of buttermilk as an ingredient. McKenney did not respond to a request for comment.
Bellamy denied the allegations. “Like many bakers, I draw inspiration from the classics, but the creations you see at
Brooki Bakehouse reflect my own experience, taste, and passion for baking, born of countless hours of my childhood
spent in my home kitchen with Mum,” she said in a statement Wednesday.
She added that she had been subject to online attacks since the allegations emerged.
“While baking has leeway for creativity, much of it is a precise science and is necessarily formulaic,” she said. “Many
recipes are bound to share common steps and measures: if they don’t, they simply don’t work.” In a separate post on
Instagram, she said she had offered to remove the recipes from future reprints of the book to “prevent further
aggravation.”

I have nothing to gain from speaking out, but staying silent would make me
complicit. Because I’m not the only one. ~ Nagi
**UPDATE: I’ve had to turn off comments because there is additional risk of
legal action being brought against me by Penguin and Brooki by what you say.
But thank you, for the support you have shown. I was so nervous and worried.**

Can you copyright a recipe?
While intellectual property law — which covers patents, trademarks, copyright and trade secrets — can be used to
protect unique names of creations such as the Cronut or trade secrets like the formula for Coca-Cola, it’s much trickier
with recipes.
Copyright law in Australia, where Bellamy and Maehashi are based, follows the same broad architecture as in the
United States and Britain, where simple lists of ingredients or recipe steps can’t be protected because they are regarded
as an idea.
It is only when there is a highly original expression of instructions or a collection of recipes, such as in a book, that
there may be a basis for a claim.
Legal experts say the proliferation of content in the online world has amplified opportunities for creators to share their
content, but also makes distinguishing its origins difficult.
“Recipes are mostly derivative of each other, and I think that’s okay,” said Jenné Claiborne, the creator of recipe
website Sweet Potato Soul. “The problem comes when you clearly copy someone’s unique spin or original never-before-
seen recipe without credit.”
In 2021, the publisher of London-based chef Elizabeth Haigh’s highly anticipated cookbook, “Makan: Recipes from the
Heart of Singapore,” withdrew the title from circulation “due to rights issues” after another author claimed that content
in Haigh’s book, including recipes and other passages, had been copied from her own.
On the flip side, in 2010, Jessica Seinfeld won a copyright lawsuit filed against her after a New York judge ruled that
her cookbook, “Deceptively Delicious,” did not plagiarize that of Missy Chase Lapine as the central idea behind both
books — hiding vegetables in kids’ food — was not protectable by law.
In her Instagram statement, Bellamy described recipe development as being “enveloped in inspiration from other
cooks, cookbook authors, food bloggers and content creators.” (Maehashi also said her baklava recipe was initially
sourced and credited from another food website, Natasha’s Kitchen, before she rewrote it in her own words after
testing it extensively.)
‘Court of public opinion’ may be quicker to judge
Daniela Simone, a senior lecturer in intellectual property law at Australia’s Macquarie University, said the scope of
copyright law in Australia for recipes is “so thin, there would almost have to be exact copying” for a claim to succeed.
“They could have independently come up with the same way of expressing a particularly common method or set of
ingredients,” Simone said.
“The key difference, for me at least, is between a moral wrong and a legal wrong. Plagiarism is a moral wrong — but
legally it’s less likely to be successful,” she said in a phone interview.
William Miles, a partner at Briffa, a U.K.-based law firm specializing in intellectual property law, said the incident
highlights the ethical issue of acknowledgment for inspiration, particularly in the online world where judgments from
the public can be swift and brutal.
“To be honest, the damage could already be done by the court of public opinion,” he said. “And the judgment from the
court of law, which might take a year or two years to produce, is often forgotten because … the bad media has already
been generated.”",NA
Shira Rubin,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/25/2025,Israel’s Ron Dermer pursues Saudi prize as Netanyahu’s closest adviser,"TEL AVIV — Less than a week after Donald Trump’s election victory in November, Ron Dermer sat down with him at
Mar-a-Lago, mapping out plans for a new Middle East. That hours-long session, meant to reinvigorate U.S.-Israeli
relations, had been requested by Dermer, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s most senior and trusted
adviser, and also drew Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, who would soon play a central role as the
new Middle East envoy, according to three current and former Israeli officials briefed on the meeting.
Dermer “was such a well-known and respected figure among all the people there, so it was easy for him to initiate,” said
Yaki Dayan, an Israeli diplomat who had been briefed.
In the halls of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, euphoric whispers spoke of an impending megadeal, including generous
deliveries of American weapons to Israel, security agreements between it and its neighbors, and the top prize — normal
diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, the wealthiest and most influential Arab country.
Such an agreement would be a crowning achievement for Dermer, who has devoted much of his career as a diplomat
and political operator to securing ties with Saudi Arabia and thus opening the door to normalization with much of the
Arab world after eight decades of hostility. He has been quietly pursuing a Saudi deal since collaborating with Kushner
during the first Trump term to clinch the Abraham Accords that normalized relations between Israel and four Arab
countries, most notably Saudi Arabia’s influential neighbor, the United Arab Emirates.
But realizing those dreams now seems further away than in many years. Israel’s devastating war in Gaza has alarmed
much of the Arab world and undercut momentum toward a deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. While the Saudis
privately applauded Israel’s thrashing of the militant groups Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — which are
both backed by Saudi Arabia’s rival, Iran — they are horrified by plans by Dermer’s colleagues to empty Gaza of its
Palestinian residents and choke off Palestinians’ hopes for their own state.
Even if Dermer is seen as a uniquely deft diplomat, he is also limited by Netanyahu, “who risks making Israel a pariah
forever,” said Aziz Alghashian, a Saudi researcher of Saudi-Israeli relations.
The Trump administration’s decision this month to pursue talks with Iran over a possible nuclear deal could further
complicate efforts if this leads to the United States weakening its stance against Iran, warned an Israeli official familiar
with regional diplomacy. For Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel, the kingdom needs to be assured of
American protection against Iran, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not
authorized to speak with the press.
Efforts at normalizing relations with the kingdom could be “undermined if the U.S. takes an accommodationist posture
toward Iran,” the official said.
Within the Israeli government, which has argued that a military strike is essential for stemming Iran’s nuclear
program, Dermer is a notable hawk. During a recent meeting in Washington, Dermer advised senior U.S. officials that
Iran’s underground nuclear facilities could be destroyed if the U.S. Air Force used its 30,000-pound “bunker buster”
bombs, according to former Israeli and U.S. intelligence officials with knowledge of the meeting.
In January, the Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas raised hopes that the guns would go silent, Israel’s
hostages held there would be freed and efforts at securing a Saudi deal could resume apace. But talks over substantive
issues, including an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the disarming of Hamas, sputtered in February. Netanyahu
tapped Dermer to take control of the negotiations for Israel, overhauling a team that had been run by the chief of its
Mossad spy agency and the head of the Shin Bet internal security agency.
Last month, with talks stalled, Israel broke the ceasefire and resumed its military campaign in Gaza.
While many Israelis opposed the resumption of war, accusing the government of abandoning the hostages, Dermer’s
supporters insist that everything is going according to his long-term plan. They say that Saudi demands for Palestinian
statehood are only political theater and that ultimately the deep trust Dermer enjoys with Trump and leaders in the
Persian Gulf will yield a breakthrough with the kingdom, said the Israeli official, who added that Dermer “is confident
it will happen soon.”
A constituency of one
Dermer, 54, is technically Israel’s minister of strategic affairs, but he is widely viewed as Israel’s unofficial foreign
minister, and his rise has helped shape the country’s relationship with Washington, the Palestinians and the wider
Arab world. A spokesman for Dermer declined to comment for this article.
Dermer was raised in a Jewish family in Miami, where his father and brother both served as Democratic mayors of the
city. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and Oxford University.
Dermer immigrated to Israel in his mid-20s, too old for the mandatory military service that serves as a defining
experience for many Israelis. He went to work as a pollster for Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident turned
right-wing Israeli politician, who in turn introduced him to Netanyahu. In 2005, Netanyahu, then finance minister,
hired Dermer as economic attaché in Washington, then brought him back to Jerusalem as an adviser.
After Netanyahu returned to his post as prime minister in 2009, Dermer found a place among Netanyahu’s “Anglo”
cohort, as it’s called in Hebrew, formulating high-level strategy exclusively in English.
Dermer’s fealty to Netanyahu was extraordinary from the start, say those who worked with him. “Ron always used to
say, ‘I have a constituency of one’” — Netanyahu — said a former Israeli official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity to discuss internal government dynamics. “Ron really believes in his kishkes that he wants to serve the
Jewish people. He genuinely believes [Netanyahu’s] whole shtick about being in another league, that only he will be
able to take Israel further.”
Netanyahu viewed Dermer’s outsider status, replete with contacts in the Washington political establishment, as an
asset. In 2013, Netanyahu appointed him Israeli ambassador to Washington, where Dermer worked to widen Israel’s
base of support by wooing American neoconservatives and Christian evangelicals. He clashed with the Obama
administration, skewering its diplomatic outreach to Iran. Officials in the Obama White House were discouraged from
appearing on television alongside Dermer “because he would rip them up on the Iran issue,” said the former official,
who worked with him in the embassy.
That all changed with Trump’s first election in 2016. “When Dermer was ambassador, he had an open door with the
Trump administration,” Dayan said.
Ideologically, Dermer is to the right of Netanyahu, say former senior Israeli officials who worked with him. He fears
that Israel may be doomed to eternal war with its neighbors and sees no place for a Palestinian state. According to
Jibril Rajoub, a senior Palestinian politician, Dermer has never approached the leadership of the Palestinian Authority
based in Ramallah for discussions.
But Dermer, at times, has also been an effective pragmatist within Netanyahu’s inner circle.
“When we were pushing the Israeli government to do things that they didn’t want to do, like letting humanitarian
assistance into Gaza, Ron was one of the people that could overcome roadblocks inside the Israeli government,” said
Matthew Miller, State Department spokesman under President Joe Biden.
A harder sell for the Saudis
While the Saudis have pinned their hopes on Dermer — seeing him as Netanyahu’s “right-hand man, who is extremely
influential and effective,” according to Bernard Haykel, a professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University —
normalization is a harder sell than it’s been before, he said.
The war in Gaza has made it more difficult for Saudi Arabia to pursue negotiations with Israel, as Saudi youths have
increasingly taken up the Palestinian cause. Netanyahu’s resistance to Palestinian statehood and the push by some
members of his far-right government to resettle Gaza and expel its residents are a challenge to the kingdom’s ambitions
to stabilize and modernize the region. “The Saudis see this right-wing eliminationist movement in the same way that
they see the radical Islamist Iranians,” Haykel said. “And that is something they want to move away from.”
Nor has the Netanyahu government publicly detailed a plan for the future of Gaza once the war ends. While Saudi
Arabia would be expected to help finance the reconstruction of the enclave, analysts say the kingdom would not be
likely to do so without a political solution that makes further conflict — and renewed destruction — unlikely.
“We still don’t know what the end game is,” said Lianne Pollak-David, a former Israeli negotiator with the Palestinians
and member of Israel’s National Security Council, who worked for years alongside Dermer.
At the same time, Middle East analysts say, the kingdom has less incentive to normalize relations. Saudi Arabia has
envisioned Israel as a potent partner in defending against Iranian aggression, but Israel’s blistering military campaigns
against Hamas and Hezbollah — along with the ouster in December of Iranian ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria — have left
Iran much weakened because it cannot rely on those allies in case of conflict.
“Israel joining the war against Iran and its proxies is seen in Saudi Arabia as a free gift,” said Abdulaziz Alkhamis, a
Saudi journalist, as are the U.S. airstrikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi militias in Yemen.
Before the Gaza war began, Israel and Saudi Arabia had been part of discussions over creating an economic corridor
linking South Asia with Europe via the two countries. Saudi Arabia has already begun building railroad infrastructure
in anticipation of the corridor and potential normalization with Israel. But those ambitions are now in jeopardy.
“It’s confusing,” Pollack-David said. “We know Dermer wants this, Netanyahu wants this, and yet, they are going
backward.”
But Dan Diker, president of the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs, who has worked in the same circles
as Dermer since the 1990s, remains optimistic. “The kingdom is leading the region into the 21st century, and Israeli
technology is still seen as an anchor of the emerging Middle East,” he said. Despite speculation among some Middle
East experts that Saudi Arabia may pursue a bilateral deal with the Trump administration over free trade and nuclear
cooperation, bypassing Israel, Diker said he doubts Israel would be left behind.
“The Saudis won’t ignore Israel, because the Americans won’t ignore Israel,” Diker said. “Dermer made sure of that.”

Mariana Alfaro,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/27/2025,Trump officials defend sending three U.S. citizen children to Honduras,"Immigration
Trump officials deny U.S. citizen children were ‘deported’ to
Honduras
The children’s removals have intensified concerns about whether the administration is violating
the rights of citizens and noncitizens.
Updated Tom Homan, President Donald Trump’s border czar, insisted Sunday that the Trump administration did not “deport”
American children to Honduras — arguing that the White House sent the children to the country because their
mothers, who were being deported, wished to bring them.
Early Friday, three U.S. citizen children from two families were removed from the United States with their mothers by
Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One of them is a 4-year-old with Stage 4 cancer who was sent without
medication or the ability to contact their doctors, a lawyer for the child’s family said. The others are 2 and 7 years old.
The children’s situations have intensified concerns that the Trump administration is carrying out deportations in a way
that violates the legal rights of both citizens and noncitizens.
Speaking to CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Homan said Sunday that he’s not aware of any specifics in the case of the 4-year-
old citizen with cancer, but he dismissed the use of the word “deported” to describe the removal of the American
children from the country.
“No U.S. citizen child was deported,” Homan said. “Deported means ordered by an immigration judge.”
Homan insisted that the Trump administration doesn’t “deport U.S. citizen children,” emphasizing instead that the
mothers may have wanted to take the children with them when facing deportation. If someone chooses to come to the
U.S. without the proper documentation and have a child, Homan said, “that’s on you, that’s not on this
administration.” Having a child in the United States “is not a get-out-of-jail-free card,” he added.
Charles Kuck, an immigration attorney and law professor at Emory University, said that while Homan might argue that
the children weren’t, by legal definition, “deported,” the U.S. government effectively facilitated their removal from the
country.
“Who paid for the ticket? It is clear that the U.S. government paid for this ticket — that means these children were
deported,” Kuck said. “Whether they had [due] process or not, whether ICE appropriately followed the rules or not,
these children were deported. The question you have to ask yourself is: What’s stopping this from happening to me and
my kids?”
On Saturday, The Washington Post reported that lawyers for the two families involved said the children and their
mothers were taken into custody while attending routine check-ins last week in New Orleans as part of the Intensive
Supervision Appearance Program, which allows individuals to remain in their communities while undergoing
immigration proceedings.
Lawyers said the families were taken to Alexandria, Louisiana, a three-hour drive from New Orleans, where they were
prevented from communicating with other relatives and legal representatives, and were then put on a flight to
Honduras.
Details of the case of the 2-year-old child suggest that the girl was not afforded meaningful due process and instead was
quickly sent to Honduras, despite her father’s wishes that she remain in the U.S.
Hours after the removal, U.S. District Judge Terry A. Doughty, a Trump appointee, issued an order expressing his
concern that the girl had been sent to Honduras against her father’s wishes while stressing that it is “illegal and
unconstitutional” to deport U.S. citizens.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking Sunday to NBC’s “Meet the Press,” blamed the parents for the fate of the
three American children, arguing that it is “up to” the parents whether the kids stay in the country or go, regardless of
their citizenship.
“If those children are U.S. citizens, they can come back into the United States if their father or someone here … wants
to assume them,” he added.
Immigration lawyers The Post spoke to on Sunday noted that under previous administrations, some American children
of deported immigrants have joined their parents in their nations of origin. But by law, those children left the U.S. only
after a lengthy process that allowed them to make their own departure preparations.
Bill Hing, founding director of the Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic at the University of San Francisco, said
it was concerning that the three American children were removed from the country so quickly. He said he suspected
that the children’s mothers faced intense pressure to sign off on their children’s removals.
“In the circumstance that they described — that’s a lot of pressure to make a decision that quick,” Hing said.
John Sandweg, who served as acting ICE director during the Obama administration, said that while “there were times
… where we encountered violent criminals who had U.S. citizen children,” the administration then still did everything
they could “to give parents the time to decide what to do with their children.”
“This rush to deport people and have them on a plane within hours brings up all sorts of custodial and guardian
issues,” he said.

Rachel Siegel;Hannah Natanson;Laura Meckler,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/15/2025,DOGE pulling data from federal agencies to remove immigrants from housing,"The Trump administration is using personal data normally protected from dissemination to find undocumented
immigrants where they work, study and live, often with the goal of removing them from their housing and the
workforce.
At the Department of Housing and Urban Development, for example, officials are working on a rule that would ban
mixed-status households — in which some family members have legal status and others don’t — from public housing,
according to multiple staffers who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. Affiliates from the
U.S. DOGE Service are also looking to kick out existing mixed-status households, vowing to ensure that undocumented
immigrants do not benefit from public programs, even if they live with citizens or other eligible family members.
The push extends across agencies: Last week, the Social Security Administration entered the names and Social Security
numbers of more than 6,000 mostly Latino immigrants into a database it uses to track dead people, effectively slashing
their ability to receive benefits or work legally in the United States. Federal tax and immigration enforcement officials
recently reached a deal to share confidential tax data for people suspected of being in the United States illegally.
The result is an unprecedented effort to use government data to support the administration’s immigration policies.
That includes information people have reported about themselves for years while paying taxes or applying for housing
— believing that information would not be used against them for immigration purposes. Legal experts say the data
sharing is a breach of privacy rules that help ensure trust in government programs and services.
Trump presidency
“It’s not only about one subgroup of people, it’s really about all of us,” said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and
economic justice policy at the left-leaning National Immigration Law Center. “Everyone cares about their privacy.
Nobody wants their health-care information or tax information broadcast and used to go after us.”
The White House did not reply to a request for comment. In response to questions, a DHS official said, “The
government is finally doing what it should have all along: sharing information across the federal government to solve
problems.”
“Information sharing across agencies is essential to identify who is in our country, including violent criminals,
determine what public safety and terror threats may exist, scrub these individuals from voter rolls, as well as identify
what public benefits these aliens are using at taxpayer expense,” the department’s assistant secretary for public affairs
said.
President Donald Trump campaigned on promises of the most deportations in U.S. history and has moved forcefully
since his inauguration to pursue that goal, including reopening family detention centers, moving migrants to the
former prison for terrorism suspects at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expel
alleged gang members without a hearing. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem has also moved to rescind
temporary protected status for Venezuelans and pare back protections for Haitian migrants.
The push is more extensive than administration officials have made public, staffers across multiple federal agencies
said, mostly speaking on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the policies publicly.
It’s not clear whether or how a growing list of names or addresses would immediately translate into more deportations.

But the ramp-up is clearly starting. DHS had already asked the Social Security Administration for help with
immigration enforcement and tracking down fraudulent use of Social Security numbers, according to a government
official briefed on the matter. At the IRS, officials agreed this month to share data with DHS, which indicated it might
seek to use tax information to find as many as 7 million people suspected of being in the country illegally, The Post has
reported. The acting IRS commissioner resigned after the deal was signed.
Other federal employees have raised concerns that DOGE officials are bulldozing through guardrails meant to keep
information accessible to only a small number of people and used only for specific purposes. That includes information
people reported months ago, not knowing how it would eventually be used.
The push to link agency data with the White House’s policy goals comes from the top. Last month, Trump signed an
executive order to eliminate “information silos.” The order said the move would boost the government’s “ability to
detect overpayments and fraud.”
At HUD, Secretary Scott Turner announced an agreement in March to facilitate data sharing with DHS and ensure that
taxpayer funds “are not used to harbor or benefit illegal aliens.” Turner told Fox News Digital that “those that are here
illegally, that are living in HUD-funded public housing, we’re putting on notice.” He has said there are 24,000
“ineligible” people in HUD-assisted housing.
HUD knows which households include undocumented people because all applicants are required to report their status
when seeking assistance. Undocumented immigrants are prorated out of the amount of assistance households receive
but have been allowed to live in public housing for years. An undocumented grandparent or parent sometimes lives in
public housing with other eligible family members.
The effort to locate and kick out mixed-status households is being led by Mike Mirski, a DOGE staffer at HUD who
plans to target cities such as New York and Chicago first, according to one employee. The power to mine that
information effectively lets Mirski “decide who is a citizen and who is not a citizen,” the employee said, adding that
those decisions would be based on flawed analyses of datasets he doesn’t know how to use.
Mirski did not respond to a request for comment.
In most scenarios, HUD does not have the authority to knock on people’s doors and remove them from housing. But
Immigration and Customs Enforcement and law enforcement do. Multiple people close to the department said public
housing authorities are on alert, hosting webinars and internal meetings about what to do if immigration officials
arrive en masse. They often conclude they have little recourse but to call the police.
In a statement, HUD spokeswoman Kasey Lovett said that “there are tens of thousands of ‘ineligible’ individuals in
HUD housing, which more than likely translates to illegal aliens.” She added that the department currently serves only
1 in 4 American families who need help.
“Secretary Turner is using every tool at his disposal to reverse the wrongdoings and negligence of the Biden
administration and is making certain that under the leadership of President Trump, American citizens are the only
priority,” Lovett said.
At Social Security, DOGE representatives have spent the past month seeking access to data and asking questions that
would allow them to ascertain people’s citizenship status, according to two staffers with direct knowledge of DOGE’s
activities who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. The team gained increasing access to
claimants’ full names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, mailing addresses, contact information, bank details and
more.
In March, DOGE advisers accessed a dataset with highly sensitive personal information, including applicants’ driver’s
licenses, citizenship status and various other markers collected by DHS, which it shares with Social Security under
existing interagency agreements. They later asked career employees how to understand, interpret and use Social
Security data and wage data. Specifically, the staffer said, the data would permit DOGE officials to identify individuals
who are working in the country without a Social Security number, a strong indication of illegal status.
Career staffers fielding the DOGE team’s questions grew increasingly uncomfortable. Employees asked themselves, “Is
it better to try to mediate and correct from the inside, knowing that we are aiding them in an effort to track down
noncitizens?” the staffer said. “Or is it better to wipe our hands clean of it, knowing they’re going to do it anyways but
in a way that is likely to impact a greater number of people — some of whom very well could be citizens?”
The issue became moot on March 21 when a judge temporarily forbade DOGE team members from accessing sensitive
Social Security data, leading the agency to boot all DOGE representatives from its systems. But in the days since, DOGE
members have repeatedly asked to get back inside the datasets, which would be in violation of the court order,
according to a staffer and records obtained by The Post.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Social Security said that it would work with DHS to “use all the tools available,
including using data exchanges to their fullest potential, to protect all Americans.”
At the Education Department, officials are also seeking information that could be used to help immigration authorities
find people to deport.
In February, the administration opened investigations into whether five universities properly handled allegations of
antisemitism. Education Department political appointees told the attorneys handling the cases to ask the schools for
the names and nationalities of protesters against Israel’s war in Gaza, according to documents and three attorneys with
the Office for Civil Rights who have direct knowledge of the situation, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity
because they were not authorized to discuss the cases publicly.
The move appears to echo a plan laid out in an essay in the Washington Examiner in December by Max Eden, then a
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and now a White House official. The essay suggested that the
department’s civil rights office could find “the identities of every single foreign student who supported the protests,”
and then immigration authorities could “revoke every single one of the protesting foreign students’ visas.”
Asked why the department was seeking the data on protesters and whether it related to immigration, Craig Trainor, the
Education Department’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said the information was necessary to assess how the
universities handled the antisemitism cases. His statement did not directly address the question of deportations.",NA
Lily Kuo;Victoria Craw,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/9/2025,Asian markets fall as Trump’s 104% tariff on China takes effect,"China increases levies on U.S. as Trump’s 104% tariffs take
effect; stocks sink
Markets in Asia and Europe slumped as tariffs on products from 86 countries kicked in and Trump
signaled a new tariff on pharmaceuticals. China said it would protect its economy but that it was
also open to dialogue.
Updated Beijing hit back Wednesday against President Donald Trump’s tariffs by imposing an 84 percent levy on all U.S. goods,
as the world’s second-largest economy signaled it would not back down, even as Chinese officials called for talks.
The retaliation came just hours after Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs on 86 countries took effect at 12:01 a.m. Eastern
time on Wednesday, with successive increases raising U.S. duties on all imports from China to 104 percent.
“The U.S. move to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake upon a mistake,” the State Council, the equivalent of a cabinet,
said in a statement announcing the new import duty.
Earlier, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said China would “continue to take firm and forceful measures to
safeguard its own interests.”
China’s move is the latest salvo in an escalating trade war that has raised fears of a global economic downturn. After
Asian shares closed lower on Wednesday, stock markets across Europe continued to slide ahead of a European Union
decision that approved retaliatory measures against U.S. steel tariffs.
The trade war is particularly fractious between the world’s two biggest economies, pushing U.S.-China tensions to a
new level of confrontation that analysts say is becoming increasingly difficult to de-escalate.
With the new tariff, Beijing has more than doubled the original 34 percent duty that it announced Friday. All American
goods destined for China will now be subject to tariffs of 84 percent, starting at noon Beijing time on Thursday.
But even as China, the world’s largest exporter, projects defiance, it has left the door open for negotiations.
In a white paper released earlier Wednesday, the State Council said differences should be resolved “through dialogue
and consultation,” adding: “We hope that the United States and China will meet each other halfway.”
Analysts said China’s retaliatory measures — tariffs, as well as export controls and the addition of American companies
to trade blacklists — can be reversed relatively easily.
“Beijing is demonstrating it can hit back hard — while still leaving room to pivot if negotiations progress,” said Lizzi C.
Lee, an expert on China’s economy at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis.
Before the tariffs took effect, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt suggested Tuesday that Trump was open to
talking — as long as Beijing made the first move.
“The president also wanted me to tell all of you that if China reaches out to make a deal, he’ll be incredibly gracious, but
he’s going to do what’s best for the American people,” Leavitt said at a news briefing. “China has to call first.”
European markets continued to slide Wednesday morning ahead of a vote by the European Union on its response to
Trump’s tariffs on aluminum and steel. The bloc’s countermeasures are expected to target a range of U.S. imports, with
tariffs up to 25 percent.
London’s FTSE 100, France’s benchmark CAC index, Germany’s DAX index and Europe’s broad-based STOXX 600 fell
between 2.5 and 3.5 percent in early trading Wednesday.
Shares in drug makers suffered in particular, after Trump said he would announce a “major tariff on pharmaceuticals”
while speaking Tuesday night at a Republican Party dinner in Washington. Companies such as AstraZeneca, GSK,
Roche, Sanofi, Novartis and Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, producer of weight loss drugs Ozempic and
Wegovy, saw their share prices shed between 5 and 7 percent in European markets early Wednesday.
In Asia, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 closed almost 4 percent lower, while Australia’s ASX 200 index and South
Korea’s KOSPI both ended the day almost 2 percent lower.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, on which many Chinese exporters are listed, fell by almost 4 percent when trading
opened Wednesday, although it ended the day in positive territory.
Confounding analysts, yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond — widely considered the ultimate safe haven for
investors — rose sharply during Asian trading hours, sending prices falling.
“This is a highly unusual situation,” said David Scutt, Asia Pacific market analyst for StoneX, a financial services firm.
“It’s incredibly rare to see moves of this magnitude in benchmark 10-year Treasury yields especially in the Asian time
zone.”
Analysts said Wednesday’s market moves reflected broad concern about the impact the tariffs would have on the U.S.
economy.
“Many people say that by the time the Trump administration realizes how bad this is, it will be too late and the U.S. will
be in a recession,” said Alicia García Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at the investment bank Natixis. “So if
they want to do something about this they better do it now.”
Other countries are trying hard to broker deals with the Trump administration to avert tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott
Bessent told CNBC that nearly 70 countries have approached the United States about negotiating over trade barriers.
Argentina, Vietnam and Israel have indicated they will drop their tariff and regulatory barriers to U.S. exports, while
South Korea and Japan are now actively pursuing negotiations.
Trump said on social media Tuesday he had a “great call” with South Korea’s acting president about a potential deal to
remove the 25 percent tariff Trump threatened to impose on the ally’s exports.
Beijing has hit back
But most of the focus was on China, the world’s biggest exporter and the recipient of the biggest tariffs.
Trump on Tuesday tripled the tariff rate he had announced on low-value packages from China, closing a loophole that
allowed Chinese companies like Shein and Temu to sidestep duties on shipments worth less than $800. From June 1,
those packages will face a tax of 90 percent of their value, up from the originally planned 30 percent duty.
While other countries have approached the White House to negotiate over the trade measures, Beijing has matched
Trump step for step, retaliating with its own tariffs and expanding its kit of retaliatory tools.
Analysts say that further retaliation could involve suspending cooperation to stop fentanyl and related chemicals from
reaching the United States; stopping imports of U.S. products that depend on the Chinese market like farm products;
or cutting off U.S. access to critical minerals needed for high tech equipment.
But the longer the trade fight goes on, the more Beijing sees U.S. moves as simply an effort to contain China.
“Beyond a certain point, further escalation loses meaning,” said Lee from the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for
China Analysis. “China would likely decide there’s no point in continuing to engage — and at that stage, retaliation
could take forms the U.S. isn’t ready for.”
Chinese state media on Wednesday was awash with commentary saying China could not back down.
“The weaker you are, the happier the United States is and the harder it will hit you,” said an article on Niu Tanqin, an
influential blog run by a former journalist with the state news agency, Xinhua.
The steep tariffs on Chinese goods will almost certainly raise prices for American consumers on products including
clothes, shoes and electronics — something Chinese state media have pointed out.
“Manufacturers here cannot absorb the burden,” Liang Mei, president of the China Toy and Juvenile Products
Association, was quoted as telling the state-affiliated Global Times newspaper Tuesday. U.S. retailers would shoulder
part of the cost and the rest “will be passed on to American consumers,” Liang said.
Independent experts agreed.
Naomi Fink, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management in Tokyo, said the new tariffs will “first and foremost be
a blow to U.S. consumers,” which will ultimately affect exporters to the U.S. But the ultimate impact on domestic U.S.
interests is significant, and countries on the receiving end of tariffs recognize that, she said.
“The thing here, and I think China even stated it, is that the only reason they’re retaliating is because they know it’s a
credible threat to the U.S. consumer, who’s also the U.S. voter, and they know the U.S. consumer is wearing the cost,”
Fink said.
Here’s how the tariff on Chinese goods got to 104 percent:
With a Feb. 1 executive order, Trump imposed a 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods, saying it was
punishment for Beijing’s lack of progress in stopping the flow of fentanyl and precursor chemicals to the
United States.
Beijing responded with a 15 percent levy on imports of U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas, as well as a 10
percent tariff on agricultural equipment and crude oil.
At the end of February, Trump announced an additional 10 percent tax on Chinese goods, again citing the
opioid epidemic. Beijing, which insists that this is a U.S. public health issue, imposed a 15 percent duty on
imports of American farm products including chicken, pork and soy — a move designed to inflict pain in
Trump-supporting agricultural states.
In his “Liberation Day” tariff blitz, Trump imposed a further 34 percent tariff on all Chinese goods, to
come into effect April 9, taking the blanket tariff to 54 percent.
China responded two days later by levying a 34 percent blanket tariff on all products from the United
States and condemned the Trump administration’s “unilateral bullying.” It also further restricted exports
of rare earth minerals, blacklisted a slew of American companies and filed a lawsuit with the World Trade
Organization.
Trump said Monday that if Beijing did not promptly withdraw the blanket measure, he would increase the
duty on all Chinese goods by a further 50 points, taking the minimum tariff to 104 percent.

Susannah George,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/26/2025,Iran and U.S. advance to technical talks on Tehran’s nuclear program,"MUSCAT, Oman — Iran and the United States held their first technical-level talks on Tehran’s rapidly advancing
nuclear program Saturday, a more complex phase of their high-stakes negotiations.
“The negotiations this round were much more serious than in the past,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told
state television. A senior Trump administration official called the talks “positive and productive.” The official spoke on
the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomacy.
The sides met for more than four hours and agreed to continue talking. “There is still much to do, but further progress
was made on getting to a deal,” the administration official said.
Both sides have described the talks so far as largely positive, but negotiations could become more fraught as they
become more complex.
As talks opened, a huge blast rocked a port in southern Iran, killing at least four people and injuring more than 500,
state-run media reported.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered an investigation into the “accident,” he wrote on X. He dispatched
Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni to the Persian Gulf port of Bandar Abbas to “closely examine the dimensions of the
accident, make the necessary coordination, and address the condition of the injured.”
Rescue teams were sent to help transport the injured.
“Initial speculations suggest that recklessness in storing flammable material has caused this,” state television reported.
The news sent shock waves through a country already on edge amid U.S. and Israeli threats to use military force
against its nuclear program.
On Saturday, as in previous meetings, the Omani Foreign Ministry mediated between the U.S. and Iranian teams. The
sides sat in separate rooms of an Omani government building; Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi shuttled
messages between them.
Araghchi said they were able to “gradually enter more detail and more technical topics. The presence of the experts was
really useful.” But he also sounded a note of caution: “Both sides showed their will, but sometimes will alone is not
enough.”
President Donald Trump has said he would prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. While Israel and hawks
within his own administration push to use military force, he has favored a diplomatic solution — but with a tight
timeline: In a letter to Iran in March, he said he wanted a deal in two months.
His administration has not publicly declared its red lines, and officials continue to make seemingly contradictory
statements about its goals. Trump’s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, has suggested the United States wants to limit
Iranian enrichment, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said Iran will not be allowed any enrichment capability at
all.
The U.S. technical team is led by Michael Anton, director of the State Department’s policy planning office, and includes
officials from State, the Treasury Department and intelligence community.
The Iranian team is staffed largely with sanctions relief experts, state television has reported. It’s led by Deputy
Ministers Majid Takht Ravanchi of political affairs and Kazem Gharibabadi of legal and international affairs. Both were
involved in the talks between the United States, Iran and other countries that led to a 2015 agreement. Trump
withdrew the United States from that deal during his first term.
Current negotiations have been largely indirect, but Witkoff and Araghchi have also held brief direct meetings. Trump
initially pushed for direct talks with Iran in the belief the format would allow the talks to progress faster.
The fact the sides advanced to technical talks suggests they reached an agreement on general principles and perhaps a
timeline for the talks going forward. Inside Iran, relatively broad support for the talks within the country’s leadership
appears to be holding.
During public remarks Thursday, Iran’s supreme leader referred to the story of an imam who was criticized for making
peace with non-Muslims.
“The imam would say it is temporary,” the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said. “This dominance of disbelief and hypocrisy is
not meant to be permanent.”
The supreme leader approved the talks with the United States amid mounting pressure from crippling U.S. sanctions
and Israeli military attacks.
But some in Iran continue to oppose engagement. Conservative headliner Mehdi Alamolhoda, the Friday prayer leader
in Mashhad, the country’s second-largest city, warned worshipers against staking their hopes of economic recovery on
the success of talks.
“It is not right to tie our lives to negotiations and to America,” he said. He cautioned against believing “if the
negotiations are successful, our economy will be secured and if not, our economy has failed.”",NA
Matt Viser,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,5/1/2025,Häagen-Dazs and Buddha: Elon Musk waxes philosophical on his time with Trump,"Elon Musk sat down in the Roosevelt Room late Wednesday afternoon with a gathering of journalists and, chuckling at
something on his iPhone, asked if anyone had any good jokes.
Over an hour, he revealed that, during his 100 days working with the Trump administration, he had slept more than
once in the Lincoln Bedroom. He had eaten a tub full of caramel Häagen-Dazs ice cream. He also compared himself to
the Buddha.
He was a rare man, in rare form.
In the opening burst of activity during President Donald Trump’s second term, few people have played a more central
or high-profile role than Musk, the billionaire businessman who has led the president’s effort to remake the vast
federal bureaucracy and seemed to always be at his side.
He has been vilified by opponents. He has been parodied on “Saturday Night Live.” He has clashed with members of
the Cabinet. And Americans have grown increasingly critical of his role in the Trump administration.
But as Musk’s role begins to fade — he has said he is going to be spending much less time in Washington and more
time running his companies — he reflected on what it’s been like these past 100 days. At times, he projected a can-you-
believe-this attitude. He said he is still a little unsure his ideas will come to fruition. And at moments he appeared as
though he couldn’t believe he’s here in the first place — the man running the show wondering aloud how the show even
started.
“It is funny that we’ve got DOGE. Doesn’t the absurdity of that seem like a weird simulation? It was a meme coin at one
point,” he said.
“How did we get here?” he added. “Doesn’t it seem absurd?”
Several times, Musk referred to his efforts with religious fervor — “DOGE is a way of life. Like Buddhism” — and he
recalled being struck by the similarities between his efforts and those undertaken by former president Bill Clinton and
former vice president Al Gore.
“We’re basically Democrats from the 1990s who got teleported into 2025,” he said.
Musk recalled the blizzard-like pace of activity that has marked the past three months, during which his team
infiltrated various federal agencies and gained control of their systems, consolidating data in ways it sought to use to
find government waste. The effort has attracted lawsuits seeking to block the U.S. DOGE Service’s access to private
data, concerns about potential conflicts of interest for Musk and others, and criticism over the treatment of federal
employees.
It has also soured public opinion on Musk, with 57 percent disapproving of his performance in a late-April Post-ABC
poll, up from 49 percent in February.
“Things have been very intense,” Musk said. “It’s a start-up, effectively.”
Asked where he slept, he said he spent some nights inside the White House residence — evenings that, by his telling,
unfolded like boyhood friends spontaneously inviting one another over for a sleepover.
“The president is — I guess we’re good friends,” Musk said. “And we’ll be on Air Force One or Marine One. And then
he’s like, ‘Hey, do you want to stay over?’ I’m like, ‘Sure.’”
He emphasized that the Lincoln Bedroom was something Trump offered, not something he requested. Trump gave him
a tour and talked about the history of the room — and then provided it for him.
But the presidential hosting duties didn’t stop.
“He’ll actually call, like, late at night and say, ‘Oh, by the way, make sure you get some ice cream from the kitchen,’”
Musk said.
He obliged, he said. He proceeded to empty the entire container.
“It was epic. I mean, don’t tell RFK,” he said, in reference to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., letting out several
bursts of laughter. “This stuff is amazing. I ate a whole tub of it, added three pounds in one night.”
He declined to say how many nights he stayed over, but he offered that it was “more than once.”
Musk said he is pleased with the $160 billion in estimated savings that DOGE — the Department of Government
Efficiency, though it is not a Cabinet-level agency — claims to have achieved, and he says it is still “possible” to get to $1
trillion.
“It’s a long road to go. It’s really difficult. But our rate of savings per day is pretty good,” he said. “It’s sort of, how much
pain is the Cabinet and this Congress willing to take? It can be done, but it requires dealing with a lot of complaints.
And the fraudsters complain the loudest.”
He said his team has found instances of fraud and turned over cases to the Justice Department. He also said it has
unearthed widespread fraudulent use of Social Security numbers, although many of the biggest examples cited in the
past have been found to be overblown or inaccurate.
“There are definitely fraud rings operating, but in order to break it up, it’s basically like mafia,” he said. “You work your
way up the chain until you get the mafia boss.”
But cutting funding, Musk said, has proved difficult. He has faced opposition from members of the Cabinet protecting
their agencies and members of Congress speaking out for their constituents.
“There’s an intense set of interests in the vast federal bureaucracy that wants to keep things as they were before,” he
said. “In order to change that, it’s like changing the direction of a fleet of supertankers.”
He’s planning now to phase out his time in Washington.
“It’s like 60 percent fun, 70 percent fun. Depends on the week,” he said. “Being attacked relentlessly is not super fun.
Seeing cars burning is not fun.”
Previously, he was spending almost every day working on DOGE but now plans to spend an average of one or two days
per week, perhaps traveling to Washington every other week.
“The amount of time that it’s necessary for me to spend here is much less,” he said. “And I can return to primarily
running my companies, which do need me.”
Musk said he would keep his West Wing office, which he said is small and where, from time to time, he has played
video games including Diablo and “Pathfinder” on a large computer monitor.
“It has a view of nothing. It has a window, but all you see is the HVAC unit,” he said. “Which is fine. It’s harder to shoot
me there … there’s not a good line of sight. I like my comically tiny office upstairs.”
He said about 100 employees work on DOGE, and it’s unclear how many will continue. He believes the effort can
continue without him running it, possibly for the duration of Trump’s second term.
Asked who would lead it when he fades, he demurred.
“Is Buddha needed for Buddhism?” he said. “Was it not stronger after he passed away?”",NA
Maeve Reston,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/30/2025,Kamala Harris reemerges to condemn Trump as she weighs a run for California governor,"Kamala Harris condemns Trump’s ‘reckless’ policies and
‘unconstitutional demands’
In her first major speech since leaving the White House, Harris urged supporters to fight what she
called Trump’s efforts to stoke fear and “punish truth tellers.”
Updated SAN FRANCISCO — Former vice president Kamala Harris marked President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office by
condemning his “reckless” tariffs, “unconstitutional demands” and efforts to stoke a climate of fear to silence his
dissenters.
Speaking at the annual gala for Emerge — a group that recruits and trains women to run for office — Harris used her
first major address since leaving the White House to urge her supporters to speak out and fight back against what she
cast as the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back decades of progress.
She accused Trump of breaking his campaign promise to lower costs. Instead, Harris said, the president is hurting
working families and paralyzing American businesses with his “reckless tariffs.”
But the former California attorney general placed the greatest emphasis on how spreading courage could dispel the
climate of fear that she said Trump has tried to create in Washington.
“We all know, President Trump, his administration and their allies are counting on the notion that fear can be
contagious,” Harris said. “They are counting on the notion that, if they can make some people afraid, it will have a
chilling effect on others. … But what they’ve overlooked is that fear isn’t the only thing that’s contagious. Courage is
contagious.”
Harris is returning to the public stage at a moment of deep anger and frustration within the Democratic Party, nearly
six months after her loss to Trump. At huge rallies across the country, Democrats have fulminated about their leaders’
inability to do more to slow Trump’s agenda, including his mass deportation efforts.
In her speech, Harris pointed out some of the Trump administration’s most controversial actions, including how it
swept up hundreds of people it alleged to be gang members and shipped some of them to a foreign country without due
process.
She praised Americans “who are speaking out to say, ‘It’s not okay to violate court orders. … Not okay to detain and
disappear American citizens or anyone without due process.’” She said she was also inspired by judges who “uphold the
rule of law in the face of those who would jail them” and universities “that defy unconstitutional demands.”
While Trump’s critics have described his agenda as creating chaos, Harris said her supporters should not be “duped
into thinking” that. She described Trump’s tactics as a “high-velocity event” that is being used to “slash public
education” and shrink government before privatizing its services.
What is happening under Trump, Harris said, is the implementation of a decades-long agenda on the right that is a
“narrow, self-serving vision of America where they punish truth tellers, favor loyalists, cash in on their power, and
leave everyone to fend for themselves.”
Since returning to her home state of California, Harris has kept a low profile as intrigue swirls around whether she will
run for governor in 2026 to succeed Gavin Newsom (D), who is term-limited.
Though she set a deadline of mid- to late summer to make that decision, it has been complicated by her desire to keep
the door open to another run for president and to explore other paths outside elected office, according to interviews
with former aides, allies and friends.
Harris’s defeat in November cast her political career into uncertainty. Some Democrats are ready to turn the page on
the Biden era and a disappointing 2024 election, looking to a new crop of potential White House hopefuls. But she
remains popular in her home state and would probably vault to the top of the field of candidates running for governor
if she entered the race.
Harris helped inspire the formation of Emerge in her 2002 run for district attorney of San Francisco against an
entrenched incumbent. The obstacles she faced in that first campaign shaped some of the training programs and
curriculums that Emerge has developed to guide female candidates through the challenges they face in building
fundraising networks, hiring staff and running their campaigns.
A’shanti F. Gholar, president of Emerge, said the group has been seeing “the Kamala effect” since November of more
women stepping up to run for office. At the president’s 100-day mark, Gholar said, Harris was well-positioned to
deliver a rebuttal to Trump and urge a room of aspiring leaders and their supporters to stay engaged.
“Because we know that really making us exhausted and disillusioned and feeling that there is nothing we can do is part
of the game plan,” Gholar said. “That’s how authoritarianism works. That’s how dictatorships work. They really just
want people to be so exhausted that they don’t stand up and fight.”
Harris addressed some of those themes and urged her listeners to show courage during her recent remarks to
prominent Black female leaders and business owners at the Leading Women Defined Summit in Dana Point,
California.
In those remarks, she said was dismayed that she was “seeing organizations stay quiet. We are seeing those who are
capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats.”
The former vice president spoke at the Dana Point event after news broke that Willkie Farr & Gallagher — the law firm
where her husband, Doug Emhoff, is a partner — had struck a deal with Trump despite Emhoff’s objections. In late
February and March, Trump began using executive orders to target several law firms that had represented clients
whom he considers his adversaries. He issued directives that barred them from government contracts and access to
public buildings. On April 1, the president announced that Emhoff’s firm had reached a deal to avoid those kinds of
punitive actions.
Emhoff said publicly several days after Trump’s announcement that he had argued against the arrangement. “I wanted
them to fight a patently unconstitutional potential executive order. Patently unconstitutional,” Emhoff said in remarks
to Bet Tzedek, a nonprofit organization that provides free legal services.
Trump revived criticism of Harris on Wednesday. In a social media post Wednesday, Trump bashed Harris for giving a
“disastrous answer” during a “60 Minutes” interview before the 2024 election. Trump sued the show over how it edited
the interview, sparking a legal fight that continues to roil CBS.
While closely tracking the Trump administration’s actions in Washington, Harris has been thinking about how she will
shape her own political organization to build on the ideas from her presidential campaign and her legal career. She and
her team have also been exploring the formation of a policy institution, either on its own or connected to an academic
institution such as Howard University, her alma mater, or Stanford University. But those talks have been informal and
preliminary.
Harris did not address her potential run for governor on Wednesday night, but her shadow has shaped the early
months of the race.
The Democratic field is already large and includes some of her allies, such as Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis and former
congresswoman Katie Porter, who previously represented a swing district in Orange County. Both Porter and
Kounalakis attended the Emerge dinner in San Francisco Wednesday night.
Initially, it seemed as though Harris’s entrance would clear the field, but that is no longer certain. Candidates including
former health secretary Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa are likely to stay in the race
if she enters, according to several people with knowledge of their thinking.
Rufus Gifford, finance chair of Harris’s 2024 presidential campaign, said that while some of Harris’s donors are eager
to see her run for governor, she also has an important role to play now, at a time when the Democratic brand “couldn’t
be any worse.”
“Whether you are Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, now is not the time to sit on the sidelines
and not share and not speak your mind. I think the time is now to speak out,” Gifford said. The majority of her
supporters, he added, would “welcome her running for governor, doing that work in the state — being back on the
national stage.”
Trump presidency
Harris left office and returned to her home state as Los Angeles was reeling from wind-driven wildfires in January.
Minutes after stepping off the plane from Trump’s inauguration, Harris headed to a World Central Kitchen outpost
near Altadena to thank volunteers who were handing out dinners and to talk with residents who had been affected by
the fires — offering words of encouragement out of earshot of news cameras. Before driving to her home in the
Brentwood neighborhood, she stopped to thank the firefighters and support staff at L.A. County Station 12, which had
been the first to respond to the Eaton Fire northeast of Los Angeles.
She later toured the fire damage with Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, who represents a large swath of
L.A.’s west side, as well as heavily impacted areas such as Malibu. And she and Emhoff attended the FireAid benefit
concert that raised an estimated $100 million for people affected by the fires.
More recently, Harris has enjoyed the chance to reconnect with friends and entertain with Emhoff at the four-
bedroom, 3,505-square-foot Brentwood property he bought in 2012. Former aides and allies frequently resisted
questions about her next political moves by joking about how much she has been cooking.
The couple were spotted soon after their return having dinner with friends at Craig’s in West Hollywood, the same spot
where they went on their first date. She was tracked by the paparazzi on a run to the grocery store.
As she and Emhoff contemplated a life split between New York and Los Angeles, her fans chronicled some of their New
York outings on social media. They made several appearances on Broadway, including when they took in “A Wonderful
World: The Louis Armstrong Musical” and visited with the cast and crew after the show.

Abha Bhattarai,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/13/2025,U.S. manufacturers are feeling the effects of Trump’s volatile tariffs,"President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff-driven reversal of decades of free trade is creating financial chaos for the
very sector it’s meant to rebuild: American manufacturing.
Although the full extent of economic damage is still unclear, volatile tariff policies are making it tougher for
American companies to make and sell goods, whether they’re producing medical devices in Florida, toys in Ohio or
bicycles in California.
Even though the Trump administration put many of its sharpest levies on hold last week while boosting tariffs on
China, companies around the country say the recent messiness of announcements and uncertainty is hurting
business: Their costs are rising, and demand is slowing as spooked customers in the United States and abroad slam
the brakes on spending.
The economic picture, both in the United States and globally, is quickly souring as the U-turn in American policy
upends the global trading system and roils financial markets. The odds of a recession have spiked in recent weeks.
The value of the dollar has tumbled, and Treasury yields have climbed, as investors abandon both, worried about the
reliability of the U.S. government.
The fallout has been most pronounced for companies that buy or sell from China, which last week got hit with a 145
percent tariff. But even those that do business with other countries say international buyers are treading carefully,
sometimes pausing orders or canceling shipments altogether while they wait to see how the White House’s policies
shake out.
“This whole uncertainty over ‘tariffs are here, tariffs are gone’ has been damaging on its own,” said Paul Sadoff,
owner of Rock Lobster Cycles, a custom bike maker in Santa Cruz, California, that ships worldwide. “My orders have
certainly slowed. Why would someone in Japan or Australia or Canada order an American bike if things could
change dramatically again next week? It’s like everything is frozen.”
Trump tariffs
The Trump administration has for months said new tariffs, including a 10 percent blanket tax on all imports, are
aimed at boosting U.S. manufacturing, as part of its “America First” trade plan. White House officials have said they
must take decisive steps to reshape the economy, by closing the federal deficit and bringing back some of the 4.5
million factory jobs that have disappeared since 2000. But, Trump and others have acknowledged, such a massive
shake-up could lead to short-term economic pain. Shoring up U.S. manufacturing, the president said last week, is
“an opportunity to change the fabric of our country.”

Many U.S. manufacturers say their optimism for prosperity has been eclipsed by growing concerns about economic
turmoil. The industry was already showing signs of weakness in March, after a brief expansion earlier in the year as
companies tried to get ahead of tariffs. Now, manufacturing trade groups say they’re being inundated with calls from
members who are fretting about canceled orders and slowing growth.
In interviews with more than a dozen American manufacturers, most said they were struggling to smooth over
alliances with overseas suppliers and buyers. Nearly all were facing higher costs on key materials or machinery, and
several said they’d already seen demand dry up because of tariff-related uncertainty.
“When you lay out tariffs and yank them back, over and over, the threat of it wears off and turns into an
unwillingness to work with American companies,” said Suzanne Shriner, president of Lions Gate Farms, which sells
its Hawaiian-grown Kona coffee throughout Asia and Europe. “We’ve been exporting internationally for 20 years,
and all of a sudden our markets are closing up.”
Customers in Canada — which last month imposed 25 percent tariffs on some U.S. imports — and Japan are
rethinking their purchases, she said, because they’re worried about the unpredictability surrounding future costs.
And this moment isn’t without precedent: Shriner’s company lost nearly all of its business in China during the first
Trump administration, when the country hit back with duties on American agricultural goods.
This time around, though, economists say the Trump administration’s protracted threats have upended
relationships with just about every U.S. trading partner, especially after the last-minute pullback of tariffs on dozens
of nations. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that “more than 75 countries” have contacted the White
House to talk through trade policies. “Each one of these solutions is going to be bespoke. It is going to take some
time,” he said.
In the meantime, business owners say they’re in limbo. Economists are increasingly warning that a recession is on
the horizon, with JPMorgan saying last week that it still expects a downturn despite Wednesday’s pause on some
tariffs. Consumers are skittish, too, saying they expect unemployment and inflation to get significantly worse in the
coming year. Americans’ economic confidence, which has fallen for four straight months, is near an all-time low,
according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday.
“It’s become extremely difficult for U.S. manufacturers to keep doing business, which is ironic because that’s the
very group these tariffs are supposed to protect,” said Lizbeth Levinson, an international trade attorney at Fox
Rothschild. “Businesses are putting everything on hold. They literally can’t plan from one day to the next.”
International orders for Little Tikes’ brightly colored Cozy Coupe have stalled in recent months and have yet to pick
up even after Trump temporarily paused tariffs on most countries last week. The company manufactures its ride-on
vehicles in Hudson, Ohio, and typically ships about 200,000 overseas, to Asia, Europe and Latin America.
But now, with trade policies in flux and China striking back with a 125 percent duty on U.S. goods, distributors are
wondering whether it’s worth stocking the $65 toy at all.
“Basically every country in the world is saying, ‘Hold on, let us find out what’s going on.’ They’re pausing or they’re
canceling,” said Isaac Larian, chief executive of Little Tikes’ parent company, MGA Entertainment. “All of Asia is
shut down for now — if I ship a Cozy Coupe from Ohio to China and it gets slapped with a 125 percent duty, nobody
is going to buy it anymore.”
The instability, he said, has put a chill on holiday toy orders. Retailers do most of their Christmas buying in the
spring, but this year are holding off, not knowing whether the toys they buy now will cost more by the time they
arrive in the fall. Larian says his own expenses are likely to go up in the coming weeks: Although the Cozy Coupe is
made in the United States, a number of components — including screws, axels and rope — come from China.
The back-and-forth has been enough to hurt international prospects for some companies. Brough Brothers
Distillery, which makes bourbon, gin, rum and vodka in Louisville, was about to close a deal to sell liquor in New
Brunswick, Canada, when Trump first floated 25 percent tariffs on the country just hours into his presidency.
Although many of those measures were eventually paused or watered down, the damage was done, CEO Victor
Yarbrough said.
“We were about to finalize things when they said, ‘We unfortunately can’t do this,’” he recalled. “They’re taking
American whiskeys, spirits and wines off the shelves. It’s beyond tariffs at this stage, it’s about whether or not we can
build back these relationships.”
Now Yarbrough is wondering what to do long-term: Should he expand to the United Kingdom and South Africa, as
he’d planned, or focus instead on selling to more bars and restaurants in the United States? He’s also considering
opening a distillery in Canada, to serve the market there. “How do we grow and expand when it’s not clear where
these tariffs are headed? That’s our big challenge now,” he said.
Still, some U.S. manufacturers — especially those that don’t do much business abroad — are encouraged by the
Trump administration’s broad overhaul. Trump campaigned heavily on the promise of creating new factory jobs,
arguing that tariffs will encourage companies to move operations to the U.S.
Red Land Cotton, a textile company in Moulton, Alabama, is firmly rooted in the United States: The company grows
cotton at its own farms; has it sewn into bedsheets, T-shirts and quilts at plants throughout the South; and sells
almost exclusively to U.S. customers.
Although the company relies on foreign-made sewing machines that could soon become costlier, the fallout of the
trade war has so far been minimal. CEO Anna Brakefield is hopeful that new tariffs will encourage a resurgence in
manufacturing that would help her expand her own business.
In the past year alone, four partner plants — including two that manufacture bath towels for the company — have
closed, because of a lack of domestic demand. Brakefield is down to one fabric finisher to process and bleach her
textiles, which means it’s taking months longer to get products made and on shelves than in the past, she said.
“Maybe if there were more companies that needed these services, we’d start to see more of a domestic supply chain,”
she said. “It’s been a crazy week and a day, but that is the kind of opportunity I am hopeful about.”
Chris Christenberry, who runs a medical devices company in Tampa isn’t quite as optimistic. He sells scar-
management kits and skin health products to burn units, cancer centers and plastic surgeons in 80 countries and
said recent uncertainty has been debilitating for business. Among his biggest worries is that Chinese customers,
unwilling to shoulder new tariffs for American-made goods, will find ways to copy his products, instead.
For now, he is holding off on expansion plans by scrapping two job openings — including an international sales
position — and pausing investments.
“I’m just a small U.S. business trying to do what we’re supposed to: make products at home, and sell them around
the world,” said Christenberry, CEO of Atlantic Medical Products. “But because of this man-made economic crisis,
we’re ruining trust with other countries. Our international distributors are saying, ‘Our clientele is so mad at the
Americans.’ We don’t know if they’ll keep buying.”",NA
Gaya Gupta,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/24/2025,What to know about the Kashmir attack and India-Pakistan tensions,"At least 26 people were killed when gunmen opened fire on tourists in Kashmir on Tuesday.
Tensions between India and Pakistan rose in the aftermath.
Updated At least 26 people were killed and more than a dozen were injured when gunmen opened fire on tourists in a
picturesque mountain town in Indian-controlled Kashmir on Tuesday.
It was the deadliest attack against civilians in years in a region that is claimed by both India and Pakistan and that has
been racked by violence for decades. India and Pakistan have since announced sharp retaliatory measures against each
other, targeting trade and a critical water treaty. Here is a rundown on the attack and how the region has responded.
Gunmen targeted tourists in a remote Kashmir valley
A group of tourists were visiting a popular area — a meadow in mountainous Kashmir’s Baisaran Valley, known as
“mini-Switzerland,” outside the town of Pahalgam — when militants emerged from a nearby forest and opened fire.
Police said 25 Indians and one Nepalese citizen were killed. Since the group was in an area only accessible by foot or
horseback, getting the injured to the nearest hospital was difficult, one witness told The Washington Post.
Indian media outlets attributed the attack to the Resistance Front (TRF), a militant group banned by New Delhi in
2023 as a terrorist organization, but there was no verifiable claim of responsibility.
Kashmir is a disputed territory
The partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947 did not resolve the status of the borderland Kashmir region — an area
that remains contested. When the territory under British rule was divided into Hindu-majority India and Muslim-
majority Pakistan, a princely state known as Jammu and Kashmir — nearly 86,000 square miles of land at the
northernmost borders of India and Pakistan — was left independent and given the choice to accede to either country.
The state’s Hindu monarch, Hari Singh, tried at first to retain independence for the region, which was heavily Muslim.
But after an uprising in the Jammu region threatened Singh’s rule, his army led a massacre of thousands of Muslims
there, according to Hafsa Kanjwal, a professor of South Asian history at Lafayette College. In response, tribes in the
northwest region of Pakistan threatened to invade Kashmir, leading Singh to agree to accede to India in exchange for
military assistance.
The first Indo-Pakistani war, which broke out as a result, ended in 1949 after the United Nations brokered a ceasefire
agreement, establishing a border that split the region in two.
The decades that followed were marked by growing violence and a gradual erosion of Kashmiri autonomy in the
Indian-controlled state, Kanjwal said. The conflict further escalated in the 1970s, as both countries started working on
their first nuclear weapons.
In the late 1980s, after some Kashmiri opposition leaders claimed India rigged an election against them, a mass
uprising began in the Indian-controlled state. Armed Kashmiri rebel groups received training and assistance from
Pakistan, Kanjwal said, while hundreds of thousands of Kashmiris flooded the streets in protests. In response, the
Indian government deployed thousands more troops across the region, leading it to become what many human rights
groups call one of the most highly militarized zones in the world.
Since then, the countries have remained locked in the simmering dispute. Thousands of civilians have been killed in
the violence, targeted or caught in the crosshairs, and Indian authorities have arrested thousands of politicians, lawyers
and activists. Armed Kashmiri militants seeking independence or greater autonomy have targeted civilians, including
Hindu pilgrims, and Indian forces. Indian authorities have responded with crackdowns. Since the Indian government
revoked the region’s special autonomy in 2019, The Post reported, Kashmiris deemed too vocal or too close to
separatists have been fired, jailed or warned to stay silent.
Rights groups accuse Indian authorities of carrying out arbitrary detentions and extrajudicial killings targeting the
region’s Muslim majority.
Both countries continue to claim the territory in full, but each has administrative control over only one part, divided by
an unofficial militarized border established in 1972 known as the Line of Control. India controls the largest,
southernmost portion, known as the state of Jammu and Kashmir, while Pakistan controls what it calls Azad Kashmir
and Gilgit-Baltistan. China also occupies a small region called Aksai Chin to the east, which India has also laid claim to.
Tuesday’s incident was the biggest attack on civilians in the area in recent years, but violence in the region has
persisted over the past several decades. In February 2019, tensions escalated when a militant group attacked Indian
paramilitary forces, prompting the Indian air force to strike inside Pakistan-administered territory for the first time in
decades. Pakistan then retaliated against India, striking two fighter jets and capturing a pilot.
Indian officials immediately condemned Tuesday’s attack, vowing retribution. India’s Cabinet Committee on Security
also convened to discuss the attack, according to a social media post from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who chaired
the meeting. The day before, he wrote that those behind the attack “will be brought to justice.”
“Our resolve to fight terrorism is unshakable and it will get even stronger,” he wrote. A spokesperson for the opposition
Congress Party wrote on X: “Time to teach Pakistan a lesson they don’t forget.”
Pakistan condemned the attack and denied involvement. Its Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was
“concerned at the loss of tourists’ lives.”
The attack occurred during a visit to India by Vice President JD Vance, which analysts said might not be a coincidence,
given the opportunity for international attention. (In 2000, gunmen killed 35 Sikh men in a Kashmiri village ahead of
then-President Bill Clinton’s visit to India.) Vance wrote on social media that he and his wife, Usha Vance, extended
their condolences to the victims, adding that they have been “overcome with the beauty” of India and its people.
President Donald Trump also condemned the attack in a post on Truth Social, his social media platform, writing that
the “United States stands strong with India against Terrorism” and pledging support for Modi and “the incredible
people of India.”
Tensions between India and Pakistan rise after attack
Both countries said that they would revoke visas for the other’s citizens in a tit-for-tat exchange that began with India’s
Foreign Ministry saying it would require all Pakistanis to leave the country in the next few days.
India’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, told reporters Wednesday evening that it would suspend a crucial water treaty
between the two countries “until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.”
The Indus Water Treaty, overseen by the World Bank in 1960, granted both countries shared access to the waters of the
Indus rivers and was viewed for years as an example of cooperation between two sparring nations. Pakistani officials
described the decision as an “act of water warfare.”
“Every drop is ours by right, and we will defend it with full force — legally, politically, and globally,” Pakistan’s federal
minister for energy, Awais Leghari, wrote on social media.
India closed its main land border between the countries, while Pakistan said that it was suspending trade with India
and closing its airspace for all Indian-owned or operated airlines.",NA
Karen DeYoung,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/24/2025,U.S. negotiating position on Iran in flux as talks continue,"A technical team of U.S. officials will meet with Iranian counterparts Saturday in Oman, the next step in the Trump
administration’s negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program.
The U.S. team of about a dozen representatives from various departments, including State and Treasury as well as the
intelligence community, gathered at the State Department for the first time this week to discuss the still-undetermined
parameters of administration demands on Iran, which await a decision by President Donald Trump.
“I think we’re doing very well with respect to Iran,” Trump said Thursday. “We’re having very serious meetings, and
there are only two options. And one option is not a good option. It’s not a not a good option at all.” He has threatened
military action against Iran if an agreement is not reached.
Trump has repeatedly said that his red line is that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. But beneath that threshold is a
wide range of options to reduce or eliminate an Iranian nuclear program that has now produced and stockpiled a
considerable quantity of highly enriched, weapons-grade uranium.
Although State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters Thursday that Trump’s special envoy Steve
Witkoff would also travel to Oman on Saturday for a separate, third meeting this month with Iranian Foreign Minister
Abbas Araghchi, other U.S. officials said Witkoff’s plans were not yet determined. The officials spoke on the condition
of anonymity to discuss sensitive policymaking.
In their initial planning meeting, members of the technical team raised questions about several aspects of the U.S.
position, including seemingly contradictory statements by administration officials on whether Iran should be allowed
any enrichment capability at all.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio this week offered a new response to that question, saying that Iran could use a specified
amount of low-level enriched uranium in peaceful civil nuclear programs, but it would have to be imported from
abroad. Under a 2015 agreement that Trump withdrew from in 2018, Iran was permitted to enrich low-level uranium
for energy and medical purposes.
“There’s a pathway to a civil, peaceful nuclear program if they want one,” Rubio said in an interview with the Free
Press. “But if they insist on enriching, then they will be the only country in the world that doesn’t have a ‘weapons
program,’ quote-unquote, but is enriching. And so I think that’s problematic.”
There are actually a number of countries with enrichment but no weapons programs, including Japan, Brazil and
Argentina, along with the Netherlands and Germany as part of a European consortium.
The 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and promote nuclear
cooperation, does not prohibit enrichment. Iran, a signatory, “must not be treated as an exception within the global
nonproliferation framework,” Araghchi said in a speech published this week.
“As a signatory of the NPT, Iran is entitled to the same rights and bound by the same obligations as any other
member,” he said. Iran has said it has no intention of building a nuclear weapon, even as the United States and others
have noted that weapons production is the only use for the quantity and purity of the highly enriched uranium it is now
stockpiling.
Iran has also insisted that the negotiations be limited to nuclear matters and exclude discussions of its conventional
weapons development and support for proxy militias such as Yemen’s Houthis, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in
Gaza. It is seeking the removal of U.S. and international economic sanctions in exchange for what Araghchi called
“robust monitoring and verification” of its nuclear program.
The U.S. technical team that will travel to Oman this weekend is headed by Michael Anton, director of the State
Department’s policy planning office. A MAGA stalwart who served in Trump’s first administration, Anton has no
known expertise in nuclear matters.
Asked why Anton was chosen for the role, Bruce said only that “he’s there because he should be there.”",NA
Naomi Nix,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/26/2025,Musk says DOGE’s work recalls Clinton-era cuts. Al Gore disagrees.,"Three decades ago, President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore stood on the White House’s South Lawn next to
forklifts carrying government regulations to tout an initiative to rein in wasteful and ineffective federal programs.
Now President Donald Trump has his own major effort to shrink government, with billionaire Elon Musk leading the
U.S. DOGE Service that is pushing agencies to dismantle long-standing programs and execute mass layoffs. Musk has
argued on social media that DOGE’s work “is similar to Clinton/Gore Dem policies of the 1990s.”
But Gore on Friday argued that the Clinton administration’s Reinventing Government initiative took a better approach.
“We used a scalpel, not a chain saw or a butcher knife,” he said on “Real Time with Bill Maher.” “We cut the fat. Not
muscle and bone — that’s what they [DOGE] are doing.”
The Clinton administration largely tapped existing government leaders to identify specific areas where agencies could
reduce head count or operate more efficiently, Gore said. Clinton also proposed or signed laws to reform government
operations.
By contrast, Trump has brought in industry outsiders who focused on quickly laying off large percentages of
government workers — often irrespective of their job function — and making dramatic cuts to federal programs that
have rankled senior Cabinet leaders and faced repeated court challenges.
In the “Clinton administration effort, they assumed that much of what government did was appropriate, but there
might be ways to do it more efficiently,” said Philip Joyce, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland.
“I think the Trump administration is assuming that there’s a lot of things that government does that it shouldn’t be
doing at all.”
Shortly after Clinton took office in 1993, he tapped Gore to lead the National Performance Review, which was later
renamed the National Partnership for Reinventing Government. A team of civil servants analyzed potential
inefficiencies across the government.
The administration also asked Cabinet leaders to evaluate their own departments, said Elaine Kamarck, a former Gore
aide who worked on the initiative. Although the review sought savings and led to some personnel reductions, the main
goal was finding better ways to work, she said.
“We were really looking for process improvements,” said Kamarck, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
For instance, the group identified that the CIA had many Russian speakers because of the recently ended Cold War, but
not enough staffers fluent in Arabic at a time when national security vulnerabilities in the Middle East were beginning
to pick up, said Kamarck.
In the fall of 1993, the group released a report outlining its recommendations, which included reducing the non-Postal
workforce by at least 252,000 positions.
The administration also supported bills to make the government more efficient, with Clinton signing a law to make it
easier for the government to buy commercial goods and a measure requiring federal agencies to develop strategic goals
and performance reports.
“The Clinton administration was doing all of this within the constraints of the law,” said Joyce, the public policy
professor at Maryland. “To the extent that any of this would have involved congressional action, they were proposing
changes that then would go to the Congress.”
The moves were largely seen as a political win for Clinton. By 1996, Clinton was regularly bragging that he had
achieved the smallest government since John F. Kennedy was president. In his State of the Union address that year,
Clinton famously declared the “era of big government is over.”
“That made for some damn good politics,” Kamarck said.
On the other hand, the early days of DOGE have not been as politically successful so far.
Under Musk’s helm, DOGE has embraced the Silicon Valley ethos of “Move fast and break things” as it has made
unprecedented moves to shut down contracts and slash jobs. Polls show Americans are souring on Musk and Trump
amid the dizzying number of changes.
DOGE has claimed billions of savings in cuts to government contracts but some were later found to have already been
canceled. Courts have halted the White House’s plan to slash jobs of federal probationary employees.
“They went into agencies with this random ‘Let’s just cut all the probationary employees,’” Kamarck said. “That’s
insane. Those are your younger and newer and many times more talented people.”
There is one way that the Clinton and Trump efforts resemble each other: both administrations said they were
committed to using technology to reform the government. Kamarck pointed to the Clinton administration’s push to
transition federal agencies to the internet, which reduced the number of customer service jobs.
“I think that Elon Musk and his people are correct when they say that federal technology systems are antiquated and
out of date,” Joyce said. “And I think that’s something that was also something that the reinventing government
movement confronted.”
There are signs that the Trump administration might try a more surgical approach to government reform. After Musk
clashed openly with Cabinet officials at a meeting in early March about his unpredictable moves, Trump said the White
House would shift strategies with DOGE.
“As the Secretaries learn about, and understand, the people working for the various Departments, they can be very
precise as to who will remain, and who will go,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “We say the ‘scalpel’ rather than the
‘hatchet.’”",NA
Christian Shepherd;Vic Chiang;Katrina Northrop,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/25/2025,Some U.S.-made semiconductors quietly exempted from China tariffs,"China has quietly exempted from tariffs some semiconductors made in the United States, in an attempt to protect its
leading technology companies from a bitter trade showdown with President Donald Trump.
Levies on at least eight classifications of U.S.-made microchips have been dropped to zero, instead of the 125 percent
retaliatory tariff rate Beijing has imposed on all other U.S. goods, Caijing, a Chinese financial media outlet, reported
Friday.
The article was later deleted. But two importers who spoke to The Washington Post confirmed that certain
semiconductors are exempted from tariffs. One company in Shenzhen listed the exemptions on social media app
WeChat and posted screenshots of zero-percent tariff rates from a customs database.
Beijing has remained defiant in response to Trump’s more conciliatory tone this week. The two sides have struggled to
agree even on whether talks are taking place, let alone on the steps necessary to climb down from levies so high that
they essentially amount to a trade embargo.
Chinese officials declared Trump’s claims of ongoing negotiations to reduce triple-digit tariffs “fake news” Thursday.
Trump shot back with a claim that a meeting had taken place that morning, without giving details. Chinese officials on
Friday denied, again, that talks are happening.
While Beijing has consistently said it is open to talks, Chinese officials have struggled to understand the Trump
administration’s demands, making them reluctant to enter formal negotiations. That lack of clarity has made it almost
impossible for Chinese leader Xi Jinping to engage directly with Trump, Chinese political experts have said.
Instead, Xi appears to be betting that he can outlast Trump by rallying the nation with a mixture of patriotic fervor,
strengthened domestic demand and state support for key industries.
But with massive tariffs threatening to bring trade between the world’s largest economies to a standstill, the Chinese
leadership is also hoping to prevent layoffs and factory closures from dragging down a slowing economy.
The Chinese Communist Party’s powerful Politburo pledged to increase unemployment funds for firms heavily hit by
tariffs and to take steps to stabilize employment and the economy as early and effectively as possible.
“We must further consolidate the foundations of our country’s economic recovery, and the impact of internal shocks is
increasing,” the 24-member group of top officials said after a meeting Friday.
Beijing has also been searching for ways to stand tough in the trade war without slowing progress toward
manufacturing advanced semiconductors, developing pharmaceuticals and other technologies where China hopes to
overtake the United States.
Although lists of widespread exemptions have been circulating on Chinese social media, analysts suggested that China
is more likely to be providing targeted relief for specific industries or companies it considers of strategic importance.
China is seeking to exempt “irreplaceable” goods, rather than granting widespread exemptions, said an American
executive in China familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive discussions
with Chinese officials.
Some U.S. health-care companies have received imports in China that were not subject to the new tariffs, the executive
said.
Soaring trade tensions during Trump’s first term led China’s Finance Ministry to launch a U.S.-specific system for
companies to ask for tariff exemptions. Experts say that Beijing used such carve-outs widely — and often without
public acknowledgment — to protect its industries from fallout in that first trade conflict.
Asked about the recent exemptions on Friday, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry said he was not aware of the
issue. The General Administration of Customs did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.
The exemptions are as much about protecting China’s economic interests and its import-reliant chipmakers as they are
about being willing to negotiate with Trump, experts said.
“Higher tariffs on these goods would’ve risked significant blowback onto China’s own tech industry, as well as its
ambitions to break its dependence on imported goods” — something Beijing considers a “necessary evil” in the near
term, said Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a research firm.
In less-critical areas, Beijing has continued to pile pressure on the U.S. economy. Chinese airlines have turned back
three Boeing jets since the tariffs took effect. Importers have cut back on purchases of American soybeans and pork.
And Beijing has restricted exports of rare earth minerals needed in the manufacturing of electronics, drones and
medical equipment.
“We’re still quite a distance away from … an agreement that will be long-lasting and could actually address the U.S.’s
grievances with China’s economic practices,” Marro said.",NA
Dylan Wells;Patrick Svitek,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/28/2025,Democratic fight over party’s future arrives in a Michigan congressional race,"Democrats’ internal battle to shape the future of the party has arrived in a Detroit-area congressional district, where a
liberal group that has clashed with establishment leaders in recent years is making its first foray into the 2026 midterm
elections.
Justice Democrats, a political organization with a record of backing younger, more liberal challengers against older,
more moderate Democratic incumbents, announced on Monday its first primary challenge of the 2026 midterm
elections. The group endorsed Michigan state Rep. Donavan McKinney, 32, against incumbent Rep. Shri Thanedar, 70,
in a largely Democratic district.
The race encapsulates some of the generational and ideological fault lines running through the party since a
disappointing 2024 election cycle largely shut the party out of power and prompted impassioned debate about how to
rebuild. Justice Democrats praised McKinney as a climate-focused, working-class candidate who has firsthand
experience with challenges such as eviction, compared with Thanadar — who grew up poor in India, then built a
fortune with chemical and pharmaceutical businesses — who it portrayed as self-promotional.
Thanedar, who is Indian American, has faced serious intraparty opposition before in his district, which has a plurality
Black population. He drew a 2024 primary challenge from Detroit City Councilwoman Mary Waters, who is Black, and
defeated her by double digits.
In an interview, McKinney, who is Black, emphasized that the district is among the poorest in the country and argued
that his campaign is more about class than race or ideology. “This is about the working class versus the 1 percent,” he
said. “At the end of the day, I know the struggles of my community. I lived it.”
In a statement, Thanedar said: “Voters know my background. I grew up in abject poverty and with a good education,
hard work, and some luck, was able to get my education, start a small business and lift my family out of poverty.”
“Voters have a choice between my bold, strong and proven leadership, or Hollier’s incompetence, or McKinney’s
inexperience,” Thanedar continued.
Justice Democrats has successfully supported some high-profile leftist candidates in U.S. House primaries in recent
years, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York). It has helped unseat five Democratic incumbents since
it began in 2017. But it has also experienced setbacks: Last cycle, the group was forced to play defense to protect its
own incumbents from primary challenges in some of the most expensive House races in the country. In the process, it
lost two members of the “squad” of liberal representatives the group had worked to elect, Reps. Jamaal Bowman in
New York and Cori Bush in Missouri.
As Democrats grapple with how to respond to President Donald Trump’s second term, a growing number of candidates
have started primary challenges against incumbents they have accused of not acting swiftly or aggressively enough.
Some Democrats have also expressed frustration with a party leadership that features a number of older elected
officials who have served in office for many years. Their anger grew after President Joe Biden’s decision to run for
reelection before dropping out, and after some Democrats backed a GOP funding bill this year to avert a government
shutdown. This year, two Democratic members of Congress in their 70s have died in office, furthering young
candidates’ urgency to confront aging party leaders.
“The moment is ripe to reshape the makeup of Congress, and voters will only be energized enough to elect a
Democratic majority in November if they can vote for Democrats they actually believe in the primaries. Voters are
demanding that the Democratic Party be more progressive and usher in a new generation of leaders,” Justice
Democrats said in a statement announcing its endorsement.
A quickly expanding cohort of Gen Z and millennial candidates have announced efforts to topple Democratic
incumbents, largely in safe blue seats. DNC Vice Chair David Hogg recently said his political organization would back
challengers against House Democrats in safe seats, drawing immediate blowback from other members of the party.
DNC Chairman Ken Martin on Thursday denounced the move, saying that “no DNC officer should ever attempt to
influence the outcome of a primary election.”
Trump’s approval rating is in decline, and some independent voters are starting to sour on Trump and his agenda,
offering opportunity for Democrats to make gains. But the party faces its own challenges.
A Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll found that Americans trust Trump over congressional Democrats, 37 percent
to 30 percent, when it comes to dealing with the country’s major problems and see the Democratic Party as somewhat
more out of touch “with the concerns of most people” than either Trump or the GOP. Voters and strategists have called
for Democratic elected officials to do more to break through and show that they are doing all they can to fight Trump.
McKinney was elected to the Michigan state House in 2022, representing parts of Wayne and Macomb counties. Before
that, he was the political director of Climate Power, a national climate organization, and of a health-care union.
Alexandra Rojas, executive director of Justice Democrats, said in a statement that McKinney “represents the future the
Democratic Party should be fighting for: working class people taking our power back from multimillionaires to deliver
for everyday people.”
Thanedar was elected in 2022, after serving in the state House, and is a member of the New Democrats Coalition and
the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
Adam Hollier, a former state senator who campaigned against Thanedar in 2024 but unexpectedly failed to qualify for
the ballot, said this month that he would challenge Thanedar again.
During the 2024 primary, the head of the Congressional Black Caucus at the time, Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nevada),
endorsed Hollier over Thanedar. So did some other members of the caucus. McKinney said he has been “in
communication” with the caucus and expects members to be involved in the primary.",NA

talks stall
The massive attack on Kyiv and other cities in the early morning came after President Donald
Trump expressed frustration with Ukraine’s leadership.
Updated KYIV — Russia launched a massive missile and drone attack on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities early Thursday,
prompting a rare rebuke from President Donald Trump, who called the deadly attack “not necessary, and very bad
timing.”
“Vladimir, STOP!” he wrote on Truth Social, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has generally
refrained from criticizing Russia’s conduct of the war and has instead denounced Ukraine, claiming Kyiv is reluctant to
end the conflict.
The Russian attack killed at least 12 people and wounded about 90 others, emergency authorities said, in one of the
deadliest attacks on the capital in nearly a year.
The strike, the latest in a devastating series of Russian attacks on civilians, came as the White House pushes Kyiv to
trade territory for peace without adequate security guarantees, enraging Ukrainians, who feel abandoned by
Washington and are turning to Europe for support.
France strongly backed Ukraine and its insistence on a ceasefire Thursday. French President Emmanuel Macron
demanded that Putin must “finally stop lying” and respond to the offer for a truce.
“When President Putin speaks to American negotiators, he tells them, ‘I want peace,’” Macron told BFMTV. “He
continues to bombard Ukraine, he continues to kill.”
Trump claimed Wednesday that Russia was ready for a deal, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was proving
difficult. In fact, Ukraine accepted a U.S. proposal for a full ceasefire in March, but Russia did not. The White House
has since proposed increasingly generous terms for Russia, including U.S. recognition of Russian sovereignty in the
strategic Crimean Peninsula, which was invaded and illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014. Zelensky has demanded a
ceasefire before he’ll talk about concessions.
“I think Russia is ready,” Trump said Wednesday, hours before the deadly barrage. “I think we have a deal with Russia,
and we have to get a deal with Zelensky.”
“I thought it would be easier to deal with Zelensky, but it’s been harder,” he said.
Zelensky arrived in South Africa on Thursday for talks but cut the trip short after the attack.
“If Russia says it is ready for a ceasefire, then they should stop the massive strikes on Ukraine,” he said.
At the scene of the attack, Ukrainians said they backed Zelensky’s approach.
Kyiv municipal workers Oleh Gribanov and Maksym Krizhanovskiy, their coveralls and helmets dusty from clearing
wreckage, expressed little surprise that Trump was finding it easier to work with Russia.
“We don’t want to give our land away, and he wants us to give our land away and give up,” Gribanov said.
“It’s easier to put a victim under pressure than an aggressor,” Krizhanovskiy said. Trump, he said, was “an imbecile.”
Confused residents wandered through the wreckage Thursday, clutching dogs and cats rescued from destroyed
apartments, where families the night before had gone to sleep peacefully.
Rescue workers took turns digging through rubble to search for signs of life as anxious relatives and friends watched.
One man, who identified himself as a lawmaker who had grown up in the neighborhood, asked around about a man
named Oleksandr. All he knew was that his friend’s red car sat crushed outside the impact site.
A dust-covered woman, walking a black-and-white search dog named Maggie, said she was ready for a break after
hours of work.
The scene was all too familiar in Ukraine, where Russia has struck apartments again and again over the past three
years: the rush of volunteers; the tents for tea, water and snacks; the police yelling at people to stay away from
buildings that might collapse; the clatter of bits and pieces of lives tossed from windows above as bewildered survivors
stare blankly at what used to be their homes.
Antonina Pakhtusyva, 71, said she felt the world has abandoned the country.
“Ukraine is destroyed, burned, covered in blood,” she said. “How many sons have died? And we ask for help, and they
just humiliate us.”
Her neighbor, Iryna Kukushnikva, 63, teared up. The people she felt most sorry for, she said, were the children — lives
disrupted, or cut short. “We have lived through life already, but they are just starting out,” she said.
She supported Zelensky’s decision to refuse a deal that many believe could condemn another generation to more war
with Russia. “Zelensky is protecting his motherland — that’s why it’s difficult to deal with him,” she said. “Because he
doesn’t sell his country out.”
The death toll Thursday was unusually high for the capital, where advanced air defense systems generally make it
better protected than other cities.
Teens Vladyslav Muravik and Zakhar Holodryha skipped school Thursday to help clean up after the destruction. A
friend lives in one of the damaged buildings.
They have been following Trump’s peace plan closely.
“The Americans are very demanding, with demands that are unfair to Ukrainians,” Holodryha, 15, said.
“If Ukraine agrees to the demands that are set right now, in three or four years this war will start again,” said 14-year-
old Muravik.
As boys, they’re aware of the risks of the war dragging out: They fear they will one day be called up to fight Russia.
Holodryha’s 31-year-old brother was conscripted while he waited at a bus stop. He’s now training for deployment to the
front line.
“Kyiv hasn’t heard terror this loud in a long time,” lawmaker Inna Sovsun wrote on X as the attack unfolded. “And
amid all this, Trump says Russia is ready for peace? There’s nothing surreal like hearing promises of peace while hiding
from ballistic missiles.”
Washington has become increasingly frustrated by Zelensky’s position on a necessary ceasefire.
U.S. officials have proposed freezing current battle lines, which would give Russia 20 percent of the country. Ukraine
has also been told it will not be allowed to join NATO, the alliance Kyiv has long seen as the fastest, cheapest and safest
way to protect the country from future attacks.
Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday that the United States would walk away from the peace process if progress
were not achieved soon.",NA
Amanda Coletta,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/24/2025,"Who is Pierre Poilievre, the candidate for prime minister of Canada?","Meet the Conservative populist looking to unseat Canada’s
Liberals
Pierre Poilievre was once described as having the “face of a choirboy and the heart of a political
pit bull” with a habit of shooting “blindly from the lip.”
Updated TORONTO — On a bright early spring evening, a queue of Canadian rallygoers snaked through a hotel lobby and
around the block. Some had waited in the cold for an hour. Cars jammed roads and parking lots. So many people had
shown up that the venue could not accommodate them all.
Inside the hotel ballroom, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre served up a polished 35-minute set of the classics,
kicking off his bid for prime minister. He assailed a “radical, borderless, globalist ideology” and “net-zero
environmental extremism.” He promised a “big, patriotic, bold and beautiful” tax cut and to stop “crime, chaos and
disorder.”
“We will go from being a nation of tax collectors and toll masters, bureaucrats and busybodies, grandees and
gatekeepers, rulers and rulemakers,” the populist firebrand vowed, his voice rising, “to being a nation of explorers and
entrepreneurs, artists and adventurers, warriors and workers, pioneers and patriots.”
“Bring it home! Bring it home!” the crowd roared.
Until recently, it was close to a foregone conclusion that Poilievre would do just that, catapulting into the prime
minister’s office with a majority government. The Conservatives had held a double-digit lead over the Liberals in the
polls for more than a year.
But a mix of new factors — Justin Trudeau’s resignation after almost a decade as prime minister, the rise of ex-banker
Mark Carney as his successor and U.S. President Donald Trump’s attacks on Canada — have flipped the script. The
Conservatives’ 20-plus-point lead in the polls has vanished in only a few months, and the election on April 28, called by
Carney, is the Liberals’ to lose.
A Conservative collapse could have consequences for Canada and the future of the party, which has been shut out of
power since 2015. It has struggled to unite its factions — social and fiscal conservatives, populists and centrists, Trump
backers and Trump bashers — and to expand its base.
Poilievre’s predecessor tacked to the center and lost. Since Poilievre became party leader, analysts have asked whether
the caustic style and antiestablishment rhetoric that thrills his base would appeal to the rest of Canada. Some in his
own party are calling for a pivot.
“If the Conservatives lose,” said Jonathan Malloy, a political scientist at Carleton University, “there will be some soul
searching in the party for sure.”
‘A political pit bull’
Poilievre, 45, was born in Calgary to a teenage mother and adopted by two teachers from Saskatchewan. His parents
eventually split, and his father later came out as gay. “We’re a complicated and mixed-up bunch, like most families,” he
once said.
His interest in politics bloomed after he began attending political rallies with his mother as a teen. He was a finalist in a
nationwide “As Prime Minister” essay contest in university. Poilievre was elected to Parliament in 2004 at the age of
25. Colleagues nicknamed him “Skippy.”
In 2008, he became parliamentary secretary to then-Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, which involved
answering questions in Parliament in Harper’s absence. He was not content to regurgitate talking points, colleagues
said, and worked to sharpen the government’s message.
“He was probably the best and hardest-working MP in that role,” said Andrew MacDougall, Harper’s former
communications director. “If it wasn’t a file he had touched before, he would really try to get under the hood and
understand.”
He developed a reputation as a smarmy attack dog. A newspaper profile once described him as having the “face of a
choirboy and the heart of a political pit bull,” with a habit of shooting “blindly from the lip.”
Occasionally, this landed him in hot water. In 2008, after Harper apologized for the government’s role in abuses rife in
the residential school system for Indigenous children, Poilievre asked whether there was “value for all the money”
Ottawa was paying survivors. He apologized.
He won the Conservative leadership in 2022 in a landslide. He backed the “Freedom Convoy” blockades, pledged to
defund Canada’s public broadcaster and vowed to bar his cabinet from the World Economic Forum.
His grilling of lawmakers and journalists has often gone viral. During one repartee in Parliament, he said Trudeau was
“a guy who, if he were made of chocolate, he would eat himself.” He once upbraided a reporter while chomping on an
apple. Elon Musk shared the clip on X with fire emojis.
He pitched small government, tax cuts and deregulation, and made a “boots not suits” push for blue-collar voters. He
bashed the government over inflation, rising interest rates and high housing costs, tapping into fatigue with Trudeau to
build a seemingly unbeatable lead. “Canada,” he said, “is broken.”
“Poilievre read the mood of the country pretty correctly,” Malloy said.
Then Trudeau stepped down. Trump reentered the White House. And the mood shifted.
‘People want change’
Trump’s threats to annex Canada, and his tariffs on its goods, have infuriated Canadians and stirred rare displays of
unity and patriotism. For a large chunk of the electorate, the vote is now about who can best manage Trump’s chaos.
“It’s like you’ve spent three years studying one subject for a test and then somebody changed the subject and the test,”
MacDougall said. “But that’s life in politics. Sometimes, the world changes, and you’ve got to change with it.”
Poilievre’s “Canada is broken” message has lost some of its resonance, and the left-of-center vote has coalesced around
Carney, a former central banker who replaced Trudeau as Liberal leader and has steered countries through economic
upheaval.
Some prominent Conservatives have argued Poilievre should focus more of his message on opposing Trump —
although analysts say he must walk a fine line not to alienate parts of his base.
Poilievre has blamed the Liberals for leaving Canada weak amid Trump’s “unjustified” tariffs. He has vowed to protect
Canada’s sovereignty and has said he will propose a renegotiation of the North American free-trade pact. He is betting
that desire for change will reassert itself as the key issue for voters.
“The struggles Canadians are facing at home, the fear and the hurt I hear everywhere I go across this country — that is
also real,” Poilievre said this month. “And I will not stop talking about the problems, which predate Donald Trump and
which will outlast Donald Trump if we don’t act to fix them now.”
After weeks of not mentioning Canada, Trump on Wednesday reinjected himself into the country’s politics, suggesting
that auto tariffs could go up, repeating his contention that Canada would “cease to exist” without the United States, and
renewing his 51st-state threats.
“As a state,” he said in the Oval Office, Canada “works great.”
Analysts say Poilievre’s echoing of Trump’s anti-“woke” rhetoric and his attacks on the news media once buoyed him
but have become a drag. He has pledged a “warrior culture, not a woke culture” for the military; to slash foreign aid to
“dictators, terrorists and multinational bureaucracies”; to end the imposition of the “woke ideology” in the “allocation
of federal funds for university research”; and to cut the federal public service.
Sam Lilly, a Conservative Party spokesman, said this would be “nothing like” the U.S. DOGE Service, the federal group
that aims to reduce the size of the government.
“Canada First Conservatives are only listening to Canadians to develop our Canada First plan to rebuild our military,
unleash our economy and make us less reliant on the Americans after the Lost Liberal Decade,” he said.
Poilievre invited more criticism after bragging about his rally sizes, a Trump obsession, and calling a reporter a
“protester.”
“Being viewed as Trump … is how to lose this election,” Kory Teneycke, a former communications director for Harper,
said on a podcast. “And the campaign, and Poilievre, can’t stop doing it.”
At the rally, the handful of mentions of Trump drew boos from attendees. Louder jeers came at mentions of Carney.
Poilievre was introduced by his Venezuelan-born wife, Anaida, with whom he has two young children. “Fancy degrees”
don’t make a leader, she said, taking a swipe at Carney, who was educated at Harvard and Oxford. Poilievre often
speaks about how her family came to Canada with little and, “like so many immigrant families, built our country.”
Charles Wikler, 60, who was at the rally, has not always voted. The pest-control worker said he was concerned about
safety after shootings at synagogues here and was drawn to Poilievre because of his strong support for Israel. He
worried about Trump but felt Poilievre could handle him, and he slammed Carney as a “continuation” of Trudeau.
“Poilievre,” Wikler said, “is the only option.”
Poya Zamani, 29, another attendee, was born in Afghanistan and came to Canada as a student. He said he was eager to
turn the page on Liberal “mismanagement.”
“Look at this crowd,” Zamani said. “People want change.”",NA
Rachel Siegel,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/16/2025,Home builders feel higher costs from Trump tariffs and economic uncertainty,"Home builders are feeling the sting from President Donald Trump’s trade war and growing economic uncertainty,
adding to the challenge of building enough homes to fix America’s shortage.
Builder sentiment in the market for new homes has been slumping for months and stayed low in April, according to the
National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index released Wednesday. When asked about
tariffs’ effect on their businesses, 60 percent of builders said their suppliers have already increased, or announced
increases, on goods prices because of tariffs. Builders are estimating a typical cost effect of nearly $11,000 per home,
given how many products from abroad will be hit by the trade war.
The gloominess could make it harder for builders to ramp up construction, which many economists say is essential to
tame housing costs. Experts say the country is short somewhere between 1.5 million and 4 million homes, and prices
for renters and buyers have stayed high largely because there aren’t enough homes to go around. The longer it takes to
fill that gap, the longer people will see housing costs take up large chunks of their budgets.
Jim Tobin, president and chief executive of NAHB, said “builders are taking a little bit of a pause” to better understand
how Trump’s policies — on trade, immigration and more — will shape the broader economy.
“Are they getting ready to start newer projects? Are they pulling permits?” Tobin told The Washington Post last week.
“I think we’re going to see a little bit of more careful adjustment in home building until these policies do shake out.”
Trump has made tariff policy a central part of his economic vision, vowing to make trade with other nations more fair
to American households and workers. But the tumultuous rollout of those policies has spurred chaos in the financial
markets and increased the odds of a recession.
Last week, the White House paused many of the steepest import taxes on most countries for 90 days, while further
hoisting tariffs for China. It left in place a baseline 10 percent tariff on all imports from most countries, and continued
tariffs on imports of steel, aluminum and autos.
Home builders had generally cheered Trump’s return to office, betting looser regulations and what they hoped would
be an economic boom would make it easier to build and sell. Over the past few weeks, they also got a small confidence
boost from easing mortgage rates, the survey showed.
But that optimism is waning, especially because so many aspects of Trump’s agenda weigh on the housing market. The
administration’s immigration crackdown has made undocumented construction workers more hesitant to show up to
jobsites out of fears of being detained, multiple builders told The Post. Some companies are adding clauses to their
contracts that allow them to adjust prices if their material costs — say, on appliances from Mexico or lumber from
Canada — suddenly spike. The stock market fluctuations have also made some wealthier buyers jittery.
But not everyone is feeling the gloom or attributing much to Trump’s tariffs. In the Tampa area, Mike Cogdill said
inflation has been pushing up costs on everything — windows, plumbing, metal roofs, plywood — for years. He’s had a
few subcontractors reach out looking for work, suggesting the job market is struggling a bit more than usual. But he
doesn’t have plans to slow his projects, which can go upward of $500,000.
“There’s a lot of hype in these prices,” Cogdill said. “What’s being said is not really what’s happening sometimes.”",NA
Angie Orellana Hernandez,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/24/2025,"Man lied about role in Rwandan genocide on green card application, feds say","A man accused of being a local leader in the Rwandan genocide, who had maintained a low profile as a beekeeper in
New York for 20 years, was arrested Thursday, the U.S. attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York said.
Federal prosecutors said Faustin Nsabumukunzi, 65, lied about his role in the 1994 mass killings to obtain a green card
and charged him with one count of visa fraud and two counts of attempted naturalization fraud, according to an
indictment. He faces up to 30 years in prison.
Nsabumukunzi pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Thursday and posted a $250,000 bond, according to John
Marzulli, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office. Nsabumukunzi’s lawyer did not immediately return a request
for comment.
“For over two decades, he got away with those lies and lived in the United States with an undeserved clean slate, a
luxury that his victims will never have,” U.S. Attorney John J. Durham said in a statement.
Nsabumukunzi applied for refugee resettlement in the United States in 2003, where he repeatedly denied in an
immigration interview that he had committed acts of violence or encouraged others to participate in violence during
the genocide, according to the indictment.
He continued to lie about his participation in the mass killings perpetrated by Rwanda’s Hutu-led government against
the Tutsi ethnic group to obtain a green card in 2006, the indictment said. His application for citizenship in 2009 was
denied in 2015 because Nsabumukunzi had failed to “establish good moral character for reasons unrelated to the 1994
genocide,” court documents said. The filings did not elaborate on the reason his citizenship application was denied.
The government’s investigation into Nsabumukunzi included interviews with four eyewitnesses who said they knew
Nsabumukunzi and had “observed his conduct during the Rwandan Genocide,” according to court documents. The
witnesses described him as a local leader who wielded “the power and influence of his position” as a councillor in the
municipality of Kibirizi to oversee violence and killings of Tutsis.
The eyewitnesses accused Nsabumukunzi of notifying local Tutsis in public meetings that they were safe, only to then
attend private meetings for Hutus and urge them to kill Tutsis, according to a detention memo. Nsabumukunzi was
also accused of setting up roadblocks to detain and kill Tutsis when they left their homes.
In April 1994, Nsabumukunzi allegedly led a group of armed Hutu men to kill Tutsis gathered near an office area where
he worked. There, Nsabumukunzi allegedly hit Tutsis in the head with a club and later directed Hutu men to remove
the corpses, referring to the dead as “trash” or “garbage,” according to the indictment. The witnesses also accused
Nsabumukunzi of encouraging Hutu men to sexually assault Tutsi women “as a genocidal tool.”
Nsabumukunzi was convicted in absentia and given a life sentence in a Rwandan court in 2008, the court filings said.
The genocide took the lives of 800,000 people — about three-quarters of the country’s Tutsi population, according to
Human Rights Watch — over the course of 100 days.
In 2016, the International Criminal Police Organization of Rwanda issued a notice that Nsabumukunzi was wanted for
the crime of genocide.
On Thursday morning, as Nsabumukunzi was being arrested, he allegedly told authorities, “I know I’m finished,”
according to the court filings.
Nsabumukunzi, who also worked as a beekeeper in Rwanda, reinvented himself as a refugee starting anew with his
family on Long Island. He was interviewed by the New York Times in 2006, where he said he lost more than 200
relatives during the genocide but was grateful to have found work in the Hamptons.
He told the newspaper at the time, “It’s a new life.”",NA
Chie Tanaka;Michelle Ye Hee Lee,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/26/2025,"Soaring prices, empty shelves as Japan’s rice shortage crisis worsens","TOKYO — Rice is a staple in Japanese culture and cuisine, so much so that the word for “meal” is synonymous with
“cooked rice.” But demand for the grain is rapidly outstripping supply, causing prices to soar, and the country is now
taking the rare steps of releasing rice from its emergency stockpile and turning to imports.
The shortage is affecting daily life in Japan, where rice’s myriad uses include sushi and alcohol as well as ancestral
ceremonies.
Restaurants are hiking prices and no longer giving free rice refills. Bags of rice are disappearing from grocery store
shelves; many stores now limit purchases to one bag per customer. Some Japanese tourists are even buying rice on
their trips to other Asian countries.
An 11-pound bag of rice cost on average about $30, including tax, in the second week of April — more than double the
price during the same period last year, according to the country’s Ministry of Agriculture.
“It’s expensive,” Kaori Wataya, a 45-year-old mother of three who cooks rice for two meals a day, said outside a
supermarket in western Tokyo. “But what else can we do? … I’m trying my best to buy.”
Rice imports, which could leave Japanese farmers vulnerable to competition, are quickly rising. In February, the
volume of rice imported by private companies exceeded 551 tons — surpassing the total import volume in the 2023
fiscal year, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
South Korea’s national agricultural cooperative this week confirmed its plans to export up to 24 tons of rice to Japan by
early June, the largest such shipment in at least 25 years.
These exports are a sliver of the overall rice consumption in Japan, which the Ministry of Agriculture places at 7.8
million tons between July 2023 and June 2024. But they underscore the country’s rice crisis, which began in summer
last year after a heat wave in 2023 led to a smaller and poorer-quality harvest that fall.
Over the past two years, Japan has also seen a massive influx in international tourists, who had been unable to enter
the country during the coronavirus pandemic — driving up rice consumption nationwide, experts say. A record 36.9
million international tourists visited in 2024, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization.
Then, in August last year, the government issued its first warning for a potential “megaquake” after a 7.1-magnitude
earthquake struck off the coast of southern Japan, triggering residents to panic-purchase rice in preparation.
Some experts also say that government policies have exacerbated the shortage.
As food options became more diverse and eating habits changed with the rise of working parents and people living
alone, rice consumption in Japan has been steadily declining since its peak in the 1960s.
The government sets rice production targets to account for this drop as well as the shrinking population, experts say.
Government officials have long encouraged farmers to move away from rice by offering subsidies for other crops, which
reduced rice production even more.
Keeping supply and demand tight means even the slightest changes in demand can trigger shortages or price hikes,
according to Nobuhiro Suzuki, a professor of agriculture economics at Tokyo University.
“The real root of the issue lies in what I’d call a policy failure — cutting production too much and leaving farmers
unable or unwilling to grow rice, without doing anything about it,” Suzuki said. “That’s why it escalated into such a
major problem.”
There is no official move to immediately increase domestic production as planting season unfolds. A Ministry of
Agriculture spokesman said Thursday that the government’s official stance is to “produce the amount that meets the
demand.”
The ministry has previously said there is plenty of rice being produced and that the rice going “missing” along the
supply chain stems largely from distributors hoarding rice as a speculative measure.
“The producers have done their job and grown the rice properly,” Taku Eto, Japan’s agriculture minister, said in a news
conference in February. “There is definitely enough rice within Japan to meet demand. However, the distribution
system is stuck, and as a result, rice can only be offered to consumers at high prices.”
Although the government says there was an increase in rice production in 2024 from the prior year, farmers have been
skeptical about that claim, said Kazuhito Yamashita, agricultural policy research director at the Canon Institute for
Global Studies, a Tokyo-based think tank. He added that it hasn’t been enough to make up for the shortage and the
ministry has not done enough to ensure supply.
Retailers are feeling the strain, especially small and independently owned establishments such as Kurihara Store in the
Mitaka area of western Tokyo. Owner Kazuo Kurihara, 86, said the rice he used to purchase directly from farmers with
whom he has a contract has run out and he now has no choice but to buy from wholesalers, whose prices keep rising.
“The wholesale prices on the market are going up more and more every single day,” Kurihara said.
The rice shortage is also an acute problem in a nation that is already dependent on food imports — but imported rice
may be the most viable short-term solution for now, experts say.
The government is considering expanding imports of rice from the United States as a part of its negotiations over the
Trump administration’s tariffs, according to Japan’s Kyodo News agency. President Donald Trump has also criticized
Japan’s tariffs on rice imports.
Like many countries in Asia where rice is a pillar of the national diet, Japan maintains an emergency stockpile of the
grain. The government began this practice in 1995 after a rice crop failure sparked panic buying.
In March, the Ministry of Agriculture took the rare step of tapping into that emergency supply — a move typically used
in response to natural disasters — and releasing more than 231,000 tons of rice to ease the strain on the market.
The government has about 1.1 million tons of rice stored at any given time. This month, the ministry held an auction to
sell another 110,000 tons from its reserves. It plans to continue releasing more rice regularly until the summer.
But this measure has not made much difference for consumers, who are still grappling with eye-popping prices.
Eto, the agriculture minister, said supply chain challenges such as transportation problems had created a bottleneck in
distributing the rice, especially to smaller grocery stores.
“Even though we are releasing rice from government stockpiles, retail prices are not falling,” Eto said in a news
conference this month.
For families, the price increase also means changing shopping habits, like switching from a farmers market to a
supermarket, or buying imported rice for the first time despite their preference for Japanese rice.
Naoko Nakayama, a 46-year-old mother of one who was shopping at a Tokyo grocery store this week, said she would be
willing to accept the higher prices if it meant farmers would be paid more and that the money would help sustain
Japan’s rice farming industry for future generations. But for now, she feels frustrated that policymakers have no clear

tariffs
The world’s richest person, a key Trump adviser and political donor, was ultimately unsuccessful.
Updated Over the weekend, as Elon Musk launched into a barrage of social media posts criticizing one of the lead White House
advisers for President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff plan, Musk was going over that same official’s head — and
making personal appeals to Trump.
The attempted intervention, confirmed by two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of
anonymity to discuss private talks, has not brought success so far; Trump threatened Monday to add new 50 percent
tariffs on imports from China to go along with the 34 percent taxes he announced last week. (The president did signal
he was open to negotiations on some aspects of his policy.) Musk, meanwhile, posted a video to X in which the late
conservative economist Milton Friedman touted the benefits of international trade cooperation — “the impersonal
operation of prices,” as he put it — breaking down the sources of the materials that go into a simple wooden pencil.
Musk’s break with Trump over a signature administration priority marks the highest-profile disagreement between the
president and one of his key advisers, who poured nearly $290 million into backing him and other Republicans in last
year’s elections and has been leading the U.S. DOGE Service’s cost-cutting efforts since January. Musk has also
disagreed with other members of Trump’s coalition on issues such as H1-B visas for skilled immigrants and on DOGE’s
approach to government spending.
On Saturday, Musk took aim at the administration official who has been key to developing the tariff plans, White
House trade adviser Peter Navarro, lighting into his credentials.
“A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing,” Musk wrote.
On Tuesday morning, Musk again targeted Navarro in a series of X posts, as he responded to comments made by
Navarro on CNBC calling Musk a “car assembler,” rather than a manufacturer “in many cases.”
“Navarro is truly a moron,” Musk said in one post decrying the claim as false, before calling him “dumber than a sack of
bricks” in another, and following up by defending Tesla, saying it is “the most vertically integrated auto manufacturer
in America with the highest percentage of US content.”
Musk concluded by saying, “Navarro should ask the fake expert he invented, Ron Vara,” a reference to Navarro’s
reported use of a fictional trade expert — an anagram of his last name — in his books.
Navarro did not respond to a request for comment Monday, nor did he immediately respond to a follow-up Tuesday.
“Look, these are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs,” White House press
secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday. “Boys will be boys and we will let their public sparring continue.
And you guys should all be very grateful that we have the most transparent administration in history. And I think it
also speaks to the president’s willingness to hear from all sides.”
In an interview with Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini over the weekend, Musk also said he would like to
see a “free trade zone” between Europe and the United States: “At the end of the day, I hope it’s agreed that both
Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation.”
Musk also said that he would like more freedom for people to move between countries in Europe and the United States
and work in either “if they wish.”
“That has certainly been my advice to the president,” he said.
Musk, who is chief executive of electric vehicle maker Tesla, has long seen tariffs as detrimental to the business aims of
a company that counts both the United States and China as key manufacturing and consumer hubs. Other car
manufacturers, though, are likely to be hurt more by the new tariffs, analysts have said.
But Musk has opposed tariffs since at least Trump’s first term, when Tesla filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the tax on
Tesla’s imports from China to the United States.
In 2020, top executives at Tesla wanted the company to sue the Trump administration over its tariffs on China. Musk
initially agreed, saying that parts of Trump’s package were unfair to the carmaker. But after Tesla filed the lawsuit in
September 2020, Musk reacted in a “super negative way” about the decision, even berating some staff members for
suggesting Tesla file the suit, according to a person familiar with the matter, because right-wing accounts on Twitter
said Musk was trying to curry favor with the Chinese and was going against Trump’s “America First” agenda.
Many of the business and technology leaders who supported Trump’s candidacy were stunned by the president’s
decision to go forward with such steep tariffs, and equally disappointed that they weren’t able to exert more influence
on the policy, the two people familiar with the matter said. People in Musk’s orbit made direct appeals to friends in the
Trump administration, including Vice President JD Vance and Musk, arguing for what they felt were more sensible free
trade policies. One Musk friend, investor Joe Lonsdale, posted on X that he had argued to “friends in the
administration” in recent days that tariffs would hurt American companies more than Chinese ones. Lonsdale declined
to comment about his arguments beyond his X post.
A group of business leaders worked over the weekend to put together an informal group that would lobby members of
the Trump administration for more moderate policies, said one of the people.
Many supported Trump last year even while knowing that the steep tariffs he had long promised could be destructive to
both the tech industry and the economy as a whole, but they felt that Trump could be swayed by advisers such as
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to adopt a softer approach, the people said. The business leaders also did not
anticipate that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who had been one of Musk’s key conduits into Trump’s orbit,
would be such a strong advocate of protectionist policies.
The dispute between the president and one of his most influential advisers comes just weeks before Musk, the world’s
richest person, is expected to depart his post in the administration. It also comes amid increasing pressure on Tesla to
reverse signs of slumping demand — prompted in part by Musk’s foray into politics.
“The backlash from Trump tariff policies in China and Musk’s association will be hard to understate,” said Dan Ives,
analyst with Wedbush Securities, an enthusiastic Tesla backer who lowered Tesla’s stock price target — a measure of its
viability — from $550 to $315 “to reflect these new softer demand estimates.”
“Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally … and that is a very bad thing for the future of this disruptive
tech stalwart and the brand crisis tornado that has now turned into an F5 tornado,” he wrote.
Tesla stock closed at $233.29 per share Monday, down more than 2.5 percent. So far this year, the stock has lost more
than 38 percent of its value.
Musk showed signs of attempting reconciliation later Monday. He touted an X thread from the official U.S. trade
representative account highlighting what it called unfair trade practices affecting American exporters, in light of
Trump’s tariffs. “Good points,” Musk said.
Musk’s brother and fellow Tesla board member Kimbal Musk also lobbed sharp criticism at the president over the tariff
policies Monday.
“Who would have thought that Trump was actually the most high tax American President in generations,” he wrote on
X, the social media site Elon Musk owns. “Through his tariff strategy, Trump has implemented a structural, permanent
tax on the American consumer.”
The remarks came less than a month after Kimbal Musk had thanked Trump for hosting an event featuring Teslas on
the White House lawn.",NA

peace deal
With its strong public support of Ukraine, Europe seeks to give Zelensky some space in the face of
U.S. demands while still urging compromises.
Updated LONDON — European leaders are straining to maintain a delicate diplomatic balance as attempts to reach a peace deal
in Ukraine near a critical juncture, expressing full-throated backing for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky even
as they try to edge him closer to accepting some of the controversial terms being pushed by President Donald Trump.
French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in particular, have backed Zelensky’s
demands for an unconditional ceasefire, which Macron said this week the Kremlin “must accept.” To date, Russian
President Vladimir Putin, who on Friday met for roughly three hours with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, has
rejected a full truce.
Europe also is supporting Zelensky’s insistence that a deal must include significant security guarantees for Ukraine.
This steadfast support for Ukraine has given Kyiv, which is reluctant to set off a new round of tensions with
Washington, some much-needed space to push back on the White House. The support comes even as Europe
acknowledges privately that it will not be able to fully make up for U.S. support if the White House pulls the plug on
Ukraine.
Europe this week proposed a new set of terms to counter a U.S. proposal given to Ukraine last week, which had been
described as the final U.S. offer for a deal. Those terms were widely viewed by Ukrainians and Europeans as heavily
favoring Russia. The deal would have involved U.S. recognition of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and the
handover to Moscow of the areas it controls in exchange for stopping further attacks, as well as the immediate lifting of
sanctions on Russia.

European leaders, who were set to host high-level talks in London on Wednesday, before two of three top U.S. officials
dropped out, added many different elements to the deal, including a full ceasefire to start and “robust security
guarantees” specifically from the United States. Europe also wants frozen Russian assets to fund reconstruction in
Ukraine and only the “gradual” lifting of sanctions on Moscow if the peace deal is honored.
The details of both offers were first reported by Reuters on Friday. The Washington Post confirmed their accuracy with
two officials briefed on negotiations.
Europe’s counteroffer represents a broader fear across the continent that an unpredictable White House could
suddenly cancel all support to Ukraine, sending Europe scrambling to help Ukraine stave off the Russian advance on its
own. Despite widespread European support for Kyiv’s cause, Europe is not immediately able to replace the flow of all
weaponry and intelligence that Ukraine needs to avoid major battlefield losses.
Europe would especially struggle to replace U.S. air defense systems that are the most effective at intercepting Russian
missiles, officials said. Ukraine is already without adequate supplies to defend its cities, as demonstrated in deadly
attacks on Kyiv, Sumy, Kryvyi Rih and other major cities in recent weeks.
For Europe and Ukraine, one Western official said, “it is not only reasonable but necessary to push back on some
elements of the U.S. proposal, as it gives Ukraine practically very, very little. And Russia a lot.”
European officials are trying to edge Washington toward a more reasonable agreement for Ukraine — and to sign onto
the idea that a ceasefire is an essential first step. Calls for such a ceasefire were amplified after a Russian missile strike
hit an apartment building in Kyiv on Thursday, killing at least 12 people.
Britain’s Starmer has pushed back on Trump’s efforts to pin snags in the peace process on Ukraine, and he has refused
to endorse any formal recognition of Crimea as Russian. Britain also announced Thursday a new round of sanctions on
Russia, banning the transfer of energy software and even video game controllers that can be used to pilot drones.
Mediators are struggling to keep the sides talking. On the Ukrainian side, the key requirements of any deal are strong
security guarantees and minimizing any territorial concessions.
“We’re trying to find a very very narrow landing strip here,” said one diplomat directly involved in discussions, who like
others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive deliberations. “We have to
avoid a position where Ukrainian red lines are so breached they walk away. We think we’re getting there.”
An official briefed on the talks said Ukraine is “worried about what the U.S. will do.” Europeans see Moscow’s influence
on Washington and its tendency to make ancient territorial claims to justify modern military aggression as a looming
threat. “Maybe it sounds like old fairy tale to some Americans, but here in Europe it means that Russia has not
forgotten how to divide,” the official said. “Europeans help [Ukraine] a lot, but they are worried, too.”
At the same time, Europeans are urging Zelensky to acknowledge the likelihood that Ukraine will have to give up
territory as part of an accord. They made progress in that effort Wednesday, one official said.
There is a growing sense among negotiators that Ukraine may be willing to endure effective Russian control of Crimea
if Kyiv is not required to recognize it legally. Many Ukrainians do not want to rule out the possibility of retaking the
territory, even in the distant future.
But even such a compromise remains distasteful to Ukraine, which sees it as setting a dangerous precedent for Putin to
expect eventual similar recognition for other Ukrainian regions he has illegally seized.
The official briefed on the talks said Europe is trying to help “engage everyone with Trump normally … and speed up
their military production, but it takes time.” He added that while U.S. support is necessary, it doesn’t mean that
Ukraine will accede to Russian demands “because Americans are blackmailing that they won’t help.”
But all sides are confronting the reality that sustaining the fight will be significantly harder without direct American
support.
“We urgently need to maintain and develop transatlantic solidarity and cooperation,” said Oleksandr Merezhko, a top
Ukrainian parliamentarian. “From a geopolitical and geoeconomics standpoint, the U.S. is truly an indispensable
country for Europe and Ukraine.”
Still, many in Europe have warned that Washington is pursuing a “policy of appeasement.”
To that end, a Kremlin aid on Friday said after Putin’s meeting with Witkoff that Moscow and Washington were “closer
together, not only on Ukraine but also on a number of other international issues.” The aide, Yuri Ushakov, told
reporters that the discussion centered in part on restarting direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, though
there was no indication that would happen imminently.
Witkoff’s team did not immediately provide a readout of the meeting. Trump declared on social media that “SUCCESS
seems to be in the future!”
Though support for Ukraine has cratered among many Republicans as Trump has tightened his control over the party,
one GOP leader, Sen. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), warned the president on Friday that Putin is “playing America as a patsy”
— imploring him to enact “the toughest of sanctions” on the Russian leader.
In Europe, some officials called for a more aggressive response to the terms Trump is pushing on Ukraine, which
conservative German lawmaker Roderich Kiesewetter described as a “deed of surrender.”
Gabrielius Landsbergis, a former foreign minister of Lithuania, said European countries should immediately launch
new funding for weapons and license European weapons systems to Ukraine’s growing defense industry. He also called
for the European Union to fast-track Ukraine’s application to join the body and set specific target dates.
“We have to resist,” Landsbergis said. “If this offer really is take or leave it, we have to leave it.”
On a bench outside his destroyed apartment in Kyiv on Thursday, Anton Dubyno, 34, sat with what little he had
salvaged — his two cats, dog and computer — after a Russian missile struck the building next door, collapsing his walls.
He watched rescue workers rush to pull victims from the rubble. By day’s end, 12 of his neighbors had been declared
dead.
Europeans should realize, Dubyno said, that if they don’t stop the war now, “this is going to be them in a couple of
years.”

Rachel Chason;Rael Ombuor;Abiodun Jamiu;Andrei Popoviciu,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/27/2025,Africa was vital to Francis’s papacy — and will shape the church’s future,"DAKAR, Senegal — Pope Francis ministered to the poor in Kenya and kissed the feet of South Sudan’s feuding rulers in
a plea for peace. He urged Christians and Muslims to reconcile in the Central African Republic and condemned the
exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo. And he elevated African church leaders who will
help choose his successor — and shape the future of the church.
During Francis’s 12-year papacy, the number of African Catholics jumped from about 176 million to 281 million,
according to Vatican statistics, even as church attendance stagnated or declined in other parts of the world. Today, 1 in
5 of the world’s Catholics live on the continent.
“Africa is now the hope of the church — the seed of faith is sprouting here far more than in the Western world,” said
Stephen Anaedu, a parish priest in northwest Nigeria. “We used to have White Western missionaries coming here to
teach us about religion. Now … Africans are going to evangelize the world.”
Congo has the highest number of baptized Catholics globally at nearly 55 million, followed by Nigeria, with 35 million.
Africa and Asia are the only regions where the number of priests is increasing, the Vatican says.
Johnstone Kpilaakaa, a 25-year-old writer and practicing Catholic in the Nigerian city of Jos, said that young Africans
are already “actively shaping” the future of the church, sometimes in unexpected ways. He said hundreds of Nigerians
gather daily on X to pray the rosary together. Catholicism in Nigeria, he said, is characterized by its “intensity” — a
Georgetown University study found 94 percent of the country’s Catholics attend Mass at least once a week.
“This is the direction the church is headed,” Kpilaakaa said. “Not a one-way relationship where Africa receives, but a
reciprocal one where Africa contributes spiritually, intellectually and prophetically.”
In a reflection of the church’s demographic shifts, Francis nominated a historically diverse pool of cardinals — 18 of the
135 eligible to vote in the upcoming conclave are from Africa, prompting speculation there could be an African pontiff
for the first time in modern history.
No matter who is selected, this region will be pivotal in determining the direction of the faith. The church here tends to
be substantially more conservative than in other parts of the world, and leaders from the continent clashed openly with
Francis in recent years — particularly after he issued guidance in late 2023 that priests could offer blessings to same-
sex couples.
Regional Catholic leaders released a public letter saying there would be no blessings for same-sex couples in Africa’s
churches because such unions are “contrary to the will of God” and “intrinsically disordered.” The letter was
spearheaded by Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, who is the archbishop of Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, and among those who could possibly succeed Francis.
Other African cardinals thought to be in the running are Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson, a close adviser to Francis,
including on climate issues, who is seen as more progressive; and Cardinal Robert Sarah, a staunch conservative from
Guinea who has urged the church to stay true to its traditional teachings.
Anaedu, the Nigerian priest, said the Western focus on liberalism and “this idea that I want to live freely, at all costs,”
including when it comes to issues of same-sex marriage and abortion, has been “catastrophic for the church.”
During last year’s Catholic synod, there was a dialogue between Western and African bishops on LGBTQ+ issues, said
Ebuka Mbanude, a Nigerian priest who serves in the Archdiocese of Washington, with one African bishop likening
same-sex unions to “witchcraft.”
A thornier question for church leaders in Africa, he added, is how to treat polygamous marriages. Catholic doctrine is
clear that marriage should be between one man and one woman, he said, but it is still common in parts of Africa,
including in Catholic communities, for men to marry more than one woman.
As cardinals gather in the Sistine Chapel, Mbanude imagines they will seek a pope who “is going to be open to the
discussion and will guide the church through gray areas.”
In meetings ahead of the conclave, many church leaders will emphasize the importance of “clarity” on church doctrine,
including on issues such as same-sex blessings, said Paulinus I. Odozor, a priest and professor at the University of
Notre Dame.
The issue is important for many African leaders, Odozor said, who feel strongly that “doctrine should not be watered
down.” But he does not think African cardinals will necessarily vote as a bloc, noting that many factors weigh on the
ultimate decision.
Francis, whatever his doctrinal differences with the African church, was adored across the continent, said Andreas Mac
Mabior, a South Sudanese political analyst who leads the choir at the archdiocese in Juba, because he showed genuine
care for the downtrodden and the forgotten.
Francis visited the region five times over the course of his papacy, leading massive, adoring crowds in prayer. He spoke
honestly about the damaging legacy of colonialism, lambasted elites who hoard wealth, advocated for migrants and
waded into some of Africa’s most intractable conflicts.
Even in his final weeks, Mabior noted, Francis was writing to the leaders of South Sudan, urging them to de-escalate
tensions that have revived fears of a return to all-out war.
“We knew that South Sudan was in his heart,” said Mabior, who met Francis when he visited the country in 2023. “He
made us feel like we were part of the family of God.”
In Sudan’s isolated Nuba Mountains, Tom Catena, an American Catholic missionary who runs one of only two
functioning hospitals, was making the rounds in the malnutrition ward Monday when his wife stepped quietly into the
room to break the news. “You need to get to Mass,” he remembers her saying.
Catena recalled pausing for a moment to gather himself, then setting off to the hospital’s small hillside chapel, where
the soft rumble of drums mixed with the lilt of hymns.
“Pope Francis died this morning,” priest James William told worshipers, his voice steady but heavy. “He was a pope of
peace.”
He recalled the extraordinary moment in 2019 when Francis knelt to kiss the feet of South Sudan’s president and vice
president, beseeching them to uphold their fragile truce. But it wasn’t enough.
“They didn’t listen,” William said.
When Francis visited Kenya in 2015, he wanted to reach the heart of one of Nairobi’s most impoverished slums,
recalled Sister Mary Killeen, and was disappointed when logistics meant that he had to go to a less central area. When
he saw that members of Parliament had taken seats reserved for locals, he reacted angrily.
“He told them off and said, ‘I came to meet the poor, and tomorrow you members of Parliament have your day,’” she
said. “He made us feel important and seen.”
Among those in the audience when Francis read the Mass in Kenya was a 32-year-old gay Anglican man. Just two years
before, Francis famously said: “If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?”
Those words, said the man, who was studying in theological college at the time, “gave me an iota of hope.” He spoke on
the condition of anonymity because he fears for his safety in Kenya, which, like many African countries, criminalizes
homosexual acts and has in recent years considered making the laws even harsher.
But listening to Francis “gave me hope in the future, which I wasn’t always sure of,” the young man said. “He showed
me I could be authentic to myself … and also hold on to my faith.”

Harrison Smith,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/30/2025,"David Horowitz, combative right-wing activist and author, dies at 86","David Horowitz, a former 1960s firebrand who moved from the far left to the far right, becoming an ideological
touchstone for the Trump administration while railing against illegal immigration, political correctness and liberal
indoctrination on college campuses, died April 29 at the age of 86.
His death was announced on social media by his son Ben Horowitz, co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen
Horowitz, and by the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a nonprofit organization that Mr. Horowitz started in Los
Angeles.
The cause was cancer, according to a post on X from the center, which did not say where he died.
A Queens-bred son of communist schoolteachers, Mr. Horowitz grew from a red diaper baby into a committed Marxist,
attending his first march at age 9 and becoming a top editor at Ramparts magazine, a voice of the 1960s and ’70s New
Left.
He gradually became disillusioned by the movement and, in a break from politics, partnered with his friend Peter
Collier to write books about powerful American families, including well-received portraits of the Kennedys, the
Roosevelts and the Ford auto-making family. Their first collaboration, “The Rockefellers: An American Dynasty”
(1976), was a finalist for the National Book Awards.
Beginning in 1985, when the duo co-wrote a Washington Post Magazine article titled “Lefties for Reagan,” they also
drew attention for their turn toward conservatism. The Los Angeles Times likened them to “lumberjacks on a two-man
saw, enthusiastically cutting through a forest of former beliefs.”
In their essay for The Post, Mr. Horowitz and Collier explained that they had decided to vote for President Ronald
Reagan out of frustration with the left’s “anti-Americanism” and “casual indulgence of Soviet totalitarianism,” among
other issues.
“Looking back on the left’s revolutionary enthusiasms of the last 25 years, we have painfully learned what should have
been obvious all along: that we live in an imperfect world that is bettered only with great difficulty and easily made
worse — much worse,” they wrote. “This is a conservative assessment, but on the basis of half a lifetime’s experience, it
seems about right.”
Although he continued to write biographies with Collier, Mr. Horowitz shifted his focus back to politics, reinventing
himself as a conservative commentator and provocateur.
He spoke at college campuses, wrote dozens of books (including the 2017 bestseller “Big Agenda: President Trump’s
Plan to Save America”) and appeared frequently on television, particularly on Fox News, where he denounced
President Barack Obama as “an evil man” who was “destroying our borders.”
Long before the Trump administration began seeking more federal control of universities, he helped lay the
groundwork for the White House’s efforts, arguing in books such as “Indoctrination U” (2007) that America’s
universities had become incubators for left-wing politics and had abandoned the principle of academic freedom.
Mr. Horowitz influenced conservative activists and political advisers such as Charlie Kirk, who called him “a titan in
the battle of ideas and a warrior for Western civilization,” and Stephen Miller, the Trump White House deputy chief of
staff for policy, who credited him with inspiring “generations of bold conservative leaders.”
Miller first sought out Mr. Horowitz for advice as a teenager in Santa Monica, while trying to persuade high school
administrators to direct daily recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. Horowitz later helped him get a job in the
office of Sen. Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican who served as attorney general during Donald Trump’s first term.
Outside of right-wing circles, Mr. Horowitz was harshly criticized, including for describing Black Lives Matter as “a
violent racist organization” and equating Palestinians to “Nazis.” The Southern Poverty Law Center called him “a
driving force of the anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant and anti-black movements,” citing his direction of the Freedom
Center, which began in 1988 as the Center for the Study of Popular Culture.
The center has denounced climate science, illegal immigration and the spread of Islam, organizing a 2007 event called
“Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week” that was billed as a campaign to call out “the oppression of women in Islam.” Its
gatherings drew future Trump officials and advisers including Sessions and Stephen K. Bannon.
Discussing the group in a 2017 interview with The Post, Mr. Horowitz cast the center as a key defender of “traditional
American values,” and as a counterweight to rival groups spending money on behalf of the left.
“People would refer to my Freedom Center as a ‘think tank,’” he wrote in a 2017 article for Breitbart News, “and I
would correct them, ‘No, it’s a battle tank,’ because that is what I felt was missing most in the conservative cause —
troops ready and willing to fight fire with fire.”
One of two children, David Joel Horowitz was born in Queens on Jan. 10, 1939. He studied English at Columbia
University, receiving a bachelor’s degree in 1959, and married Elissa Krauthammer that same year.
Mr. Horowitz earned a master’s degree in English from the University of California at Berkeley in 1961, and the next
year he published his first book, “Student,” a report on the political activism taking place on campus.
His political advocacy took him to London, where he worked for the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation and befriended
the Polish Marxist writer Isaac Deutscher, whose biography he published in 1971, a few years after returning to
Berkeley and joining the staff of Ramparts.
“The system cannot be revitalized; it must be overthrown,” the magazine declared in a 1970 editorial. “As humanely as
possible, but by any means necessary.” (Mr. Horowitz later told the New York Times that he was the one who pushed
for the “humanely” part.)
At Ramparts, Mr. Horowitz worked closely with Collier, a fellow editor who had also been a graduate student at
Berkeley. He also got to know Huey Newton, the founder of the Black Panther Party, which was heavily featured in the
publication. Mr. Horowitz helped the Panthers raise money to finance a school for poor children in Oakland,
California.
But he grew disillusioned with the organization, and with left-wing politics more broadly, after the death of his friend
Betty Van Patter, a White woman whom he had introduced to the Panthers. While working for the group as a
bookkeeper, she disappeared in late 1974. Weeks later, her body was found in San Francisco Bay, badly beaten.
Although no one was charged with her killing, Mr. Horowitz was convinced the Panthers were responsible. “Everything
I had believed in and worked for, every effort to ally myself with what was virtuous and right, had ultimately led to my
involvement with the Panthers, and the invitation to Betty to take the job that killed her,” he wrote in a 1997 memoir,
“Radical Son.”
By his own acknowledgment, her death sent him into a tailspin. He bought a Datsun sports car; was nearly killed when
it was struck by a train, according to the New York Times; and divorced his wife after nearly two decades of marriage.
Writing, especially in partnership with Collier, seemed to bring stability. Together they produced books including “The
Kennedys: An American Drama” (1984), a four-generation history that charted the rise of patriarch Joseph P. Kennedy
Sr. and the successes and disappointments of his descendants.
“Collier and Horowitz have blended historical research and journalism brilliantly,” Washington Post journalist Bob
Woodward wrote in a review. “The information they have gathered will always be an important part of the record,
although their particular vision of the Kennedys as doomed family will likely die with other Kennedy myths. They see
the Kennedy history as a story of alliances and dreams — in their view, the wrong alliances and the wrong dreams.
Where the individual family members succeeded, the authors see money, manipulation and insincerity. Where the
family failed, Collier and Horowitz see payment for the successes.”
Mr. Horowitz’s marriages to Sam Moorman and Shay Marlowe ended in divorce. In 1998, he married April Mullvain.
Complete information on survivors was not immediately available. Mr. Horowitz had a stepson, John, and four
children from his first marriage: Jonathan Daniel, Ben, Anne and Sarah Horowitz, who was born with Turner
syndrome, a chromosomal condition, and died in 2008 at the age of 44. He wrote about her legacy in a 2009 book, “A
Cracking of the Heart.”
Describing his political views, Mr. Horowitz said he was more moderate than his critics made him out to be, writing in
a 2002 essay for Salon that he was “a defender of gays and ‘alternative lifestyles,’ a moderate on abortion, and a civil
rights activist.”
But he was unabashed about his combative style and, to the dismay of some conservatives, his defense of Trump,
whom he falsely claimed had won the 2020 election.
“If you’re nuanced and you speak in what I would call an intellectual manner, you get eaten alive,” Mr. Horowitz told
the New York Times in 2017. “It’s a great handicap to be talking like accountants while the opposition are making
moral indictments.”",NA

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a new trade war would probably cause higher inflation and slower
growth.
Updated Stock markets slid again Friday as China matched new U.S. tariffs, deepening the trade war President Donald Trump
kicked off this week and signaling more global economic turmoil ahead.
Beijing announced an additional 34 percent tariff on U.S. goods, the same rate Trump had imposed on Chinese imports
Wednesday — a move that Chinese officials called “inconsistent with international trade rules.”
The development brought more pain on Wall Street, where major indexes have all dropped more than 9 percent since
Trump unveiled the sweeping tariffs Wednesday. On Friday, the S&P 500 closed down nearly 6 percent and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average shed 5.5 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was off 5.8 percent — firmly in bear market
territory, or down more than 20 percent from its recent peak.
The swirl of events led analysts at JPMorgan to increase their estimated odds of a recession to 60 percent, up
significantly from previous projections. In a note Friday, researchers also wrote that “the recession in economic
activity” was expected to push the unemployment rate up to 5.3 percent.
U.S. trading partners have been alarmed — and stocks have sunk worldwide — since Trump announced a 10 percent
tax on most imported goods and an additional punitive import tax tailored individually for about 60 countries.
Those aggressive policies will probably slow growth and send prices up, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell said
Friday. It will still take time to fully assess how the administration’s policies — on trade, immigration, taxes and more
— will shake out. But Powell said that “the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,” probably putting
any interest rate cuts on hold for some time. (The Fed strives to stay out of politics but is in charge of keeping inflation
in check.)
The response from China showed a full-blown trade war is already underway, even before many U.S. allies have
announced countermeasures to Trump’s move.
A statement from China’s State Council condemned “unilateral bullying” by the United States that it said had “seriously
damaged China’s legitimate rights and interests.” The new duties arrived with nontariff measures as well, reflecting
Beijing’s playbook of using pressure points that amount to what it considers a tit-for-tat response.

Though it did buy nearly $144 billion in U.S. goods last year, China exports far more than that to the United States,
leaving Beijing unable to match Trump’s tariffs dollar for dollar.
Still, China has made clear that it can use other tools to make up the difference. On Friday, officials announced export
controls on rare earth metals needed to make high-tech products, the suspension of export licenses for 16 U.S. firms
and the adding of 11 companies to an “unreliable entities list.”
Beijing also launched an anti-monopoly investigation targeting the U.S. chemical giant DuPont, as well as an
antidumping investigation into a type of medical X-ray tube imported from the United States and India.
Unlike in Trump’s first term, China has taken a more proactive approach to his trade maneuvers this time around,
where “every U.S. action garners a swift and substantive reaction,” said Joe Mazur, a senior analyst at Trivium China, a
consultancy.
Beijing tries “not to strike first but always strikes back,” Mazur said.
Tech companies that are closely linked to global markets suffered sell-offs Friday. Nvidia, the AI chipmaker, closed
down more than 7 percent. Apple fell more than 7 percent, and Tesla slid 10 percent.
Smaller companies were also hit hard, with the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks off more than 18
percent for the year. Small companies are thought to be more vulnerable to the effect of tariffs because they don’t have
the scale to absorb price increases, said investment analyst Michael Farr. “They also don’t have any power to push price
concessions from their suppliers,” Farr added.
The Cboe volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” spiked 45 percent Friday and is up 144 percent since the
start of the year. The 10-year Treasury yield fell as investors fled to bonds for safety.
Crude oil fell more than 6 percent to roughly $62 per barrel as commodities markets reacted to the possibility of slower
economic growth. “To state the obvious, the highest U.S. tariffs in more than 100 years, plus retaliation, will have the
effect of slowing the economy around the world, and that is fundamentally a headwind for oil demand,” said Raymond
James analyst Pavel Molchanov.
Analysts said the escalation by China hurts the chances of negotiations between Washington and Beijing.
“The two sides are likely not done hitting each other,” said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies. “Given the U.S.’s threat to punish those who retaliate, we can anticipate that the U.S. may
double its tariffs on China (to the full 67 percent level), in which case China would as well.”
Chinese experts had warned that Beijing would not back down.
“Trump’s policy is to scare people first. If you are afraid, you will beg for mercy,” said Wang Yiwei, director of the
Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing. “… From China’s perspective, this is blackmail, and
China is different from America’s allies. It is relatively independent and will not be fooled by America.”
Other regional leaders seized on Trump’s suggestion that he might be open to cutting deals, despite his previous
insistence that he was not interested in discussing exemptions to his tariffs.
Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Friday that the tariffs amounted to a “national crisis” and called on
ministers to “closely study” them and take measures to lessen their impact on the country’s economy.
In Singapore, Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong said the country, which will pay only the baseline 10 percent
Trump imposed everywhere, was not yet retaliating.
Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te said he was looking forward to “working closely with the U.S. to ensure a fair,
mutually beneficial approach that strengthens our shared prosperity.”
Australia’s ASX 200 closed 2.4 percent lower Friday, and South Korea’s KOSPI fell nearly 1 percent, although this was
also because of upheaval over the president’s removal from office. Trading in China and Hong Kong was closed Friday
for the Tomb-Sweeping Day holiday.
'Reciprocal' tariffs announced by the White House
10% 20% 30% 40%
Note: Mexico and Canada face no new tariffs but are impacted by a previous tax on steel, aluminum, vehicles and vehicle
parts, as well as all non-USMCA goods.
On a day he branded “Liberation Day,” Trump announced tariffs on imports from almost every country.
These included a new tariff of 34 percent on Chinese goods, on top of the 20 percent levy imposed in February as
Trump accused Beijing of not doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl and its precursors into the United States. It is
also in addition to existing levies on goods such as appliances, machinery and clothing that were already as high as 45
percent after Trump’s first round of tariffs.
Trump also slapped duties of 24 percent and 25 percent on Japan and South Korea, respectively — both key U.S.
security allies — and 32 percent on Taiwan, although he exempted its advanced semiconductors.
And Trump targeted many of the countries that had benefited from companies’ efforts to diversify supply chains away
from China: Cambodia was stung with a 49 percent tariff, Vietnam with 46 percent, and Thailand, 36 percent.
American businessman Michael Laskau said that if the proposed tariffs are imposed, the impact on his garment
business in Vietnam will be dramatic. “No one works on those types of margins,” he said. “If we were to assume the 46
percent, for us, it would be a huge, huge loss, as it would be for anybody in the supply chain.”
Despite repeatedly ruling out negotiations, Trump told reporters Thursday that he would be open to striking deals with
individual countries.
“Every country is calling us. That’s the beauty of what we do,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “We put
ourselves in the driver’s seat. If we would have asked these countries to do us a favor, they would have said no. Now
they will do anything for us.”",NA
Andrew Jeong;Katrina Northrop;Victoria Bisset,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/11/2025,China raises tariffs on U.S. goods to 125% as trade war deepens,"China raises tariffs on U.S. goods to 125 percent as trade war
deepens
Beijing hit back in response to the Trump administration’s move to raise tariffs on Chinese goods
to 145 percent, saying it would “fight to the end.”
Updated Beijing punched back with tariffs of 125 percent on all U.S. goods on Friday in response to President Donald Trump’s
tariff increases, sharply escalating the spiraling trade tensions between the United States and China.
The response underscored China’s decision to stand firm in the face of pressure from Washington and deepened the
showdown between the world’s two largest economies.
“If the U.S. insists on substantively damaging China’s interests, China will firmly retaliate and fight to the end,” China’s
State Council said in a statement.
The move came after Trump increased the levies on Chinese goods to 145 percent on Wednesday, while also
announcing that the tariffs he had previously imposed on more than six dozen other countries would be fixed at 10
percent during a 90-day pause.
The State Council derided Trump’s move to continue ratcheting up the levies and said it would ignore further hikes.
The tariffs are a “joke” and “no longer have any economic significance,” its statement said, because the current levels
make U.S. exports to China not financially viable. The new Chinese tariffs, which increased from 84 percent, are
effective Saturday.
Chinese leader Xi Jinping, in a meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Friday, stressed that trade wars
have no winners and called for China and Europe to “jointly oppose unilateral bullying,” according to state media.
European leaders also emphasized the damaging effects of uncertainty beyond the 90-day pause.
Experts in Beijing expressed concern about the latest turn in tensions with Washington. “U.S.-China trade will soon be
almost nonexistent,” said Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at China’s Renmin University. “To ease
tensions, Trump must first make concessions.”
Markets fall amid tariff uncertainty
Turmoil over tariffs drove fluctuations in global markets on Friday.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Topix indexes dropped by 5 percent, before trimming their losses to under 3 percent by market
close. South Korea’s Kospi and Australia’s ASX 200 fell by less than 1 percent, while Taiwan’s bourse kicked off the day
with a fall of under 1 percent before logging a 2.5 percent gain. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index and China’s Shanghai
composite index were mostly flat, with the Hang Seng closing just over 1 per cent higher.
Major European markets fell slightly after opening on Friday, following rebounds the previous day. By 6 a.m. Eastern
time, Germany’s DAX was down 1.62 percent, France’s benchmark CAC fell by 1.11 percent and London’s FTSE 100 was
down around 0.3 percent.
French President Emmanuel Macron said that while the 90-day reprieve announced by Trump shows the door remains
“open to negotiation,” the pause is “fragile.”
""Fragile, because the 25 percent tariffs on steel, aluminum and automobiles and the 10 percent tariffs on all other
products are still in place,” Macron wrote on X on Friday. “Fragile, because this 90-day pause means 90 days of
uncertainty for all our businesses, on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond.”
The French leader said Europe should “continue to work on all necessary countermeasures.”
Speaking ahead of an informal meeting with his European counterparts, German Finance Minister Jörg Kukies said
Friday that the United States ""has to be aware that if the negotiations don’t work, we will have another discussion
around the response mechanisms.”
Separately, Kukies said in an interview published Friday that the pause could increase uncertainty “even further,”
telling German newspaper Handelsblatt: “It is quite conceivable that the whole thing could escalate again after 90
days.”
On Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the European Union would pause the
adoption of retaliatory tariffs against the United States for 90 days to “give negotiations a chance,” but she noted that
“all options remain on the table.”
The market swings came after falls in the U.S. markets a day earlier. The S&P 500 fell 3.46 percent, and the tech-heavy
Nasdaq composite index lost 4.26 percent on Thursday, while the narrower Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 2.54
percent. Those moves followed a White House statement that import duties on Chinese exports to the U.S. would be
145 percent.
The declines came just a day after a rally, when the same markets posted big gains and the S&P 500 had its biggest
one-day jump since 2008.
Representatives from more than a dozen countries are seeking to negotiate new trade deals with the White House, The
Washington Post reported. Trump will negotiate with some countries directly, while other senior administration
officials will split up the rest, based in part on who has the best existing relationship with the representatives of a
particular country.
Consumers likely to suffer as growth forecasts lowered
Export-dependent Asian countries have been seeking to quickly address Trump’s tariffs.
Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Friday that Tokyo would try to address U.S. tariffs affecting the auto and
steel industries, while South Korean Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok said the government would provide $6.2 billion
in assistance to businesses exporting to the United States.
Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te wrote in an op-ed this week that Taipei would seek to buy additional U.S. arms and
expand investments in the United States.
Meanwhile Washington and Beijing are now locked in an escalating tit-for-tat trade war that is increasing market
volatility and likely to hurt consumers in both countries. On Thursday, Beijing moved to limit the number of U.S. films
allowed into the Chinese market.
On average, a U.S. household will face a loss of $4,700 at last year’s price levels when accounting for all of Trump’s
tariffs, which will also cut U.S. gross domestic product by around 1.1 percent, according to an April 10 estimate from
the Budget Lab at Yale University.
While China has projected confidence in recent weeks, it is facing economic issues at home. Beijing is struggling with a
property market slump, high youth unemployment and weak domestic spending.
Investment bank Goldman Sachs on Thursday lowered its forecast for China’s GDP growth this year to 4 percent, citing
the impact of tariffs — lower than Beijing’s target of “around 5 percent.”",NA
Paul Kane;Theodoric Meyer,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/28/2025,Brian Schatz has formally entered the race to become Democratic whip,"Sen. Brian Schatz (Hawaii) has formally launched his campaign to take over as the No. 2 Senate Democrat, vowing to
guide an “emerging generation” of the party’s leadership.
Schatz, 52, is pitching himself for Democratic whip as someone focused on the tedious work on the Senate floor
jousting with Republicans to help shape the debate. A regular in the Senate gym’s pickup basketball games, Schatz
likened his approach to how some people “just love rebounding,” diving into scrums for loose balls that are not pretty
but can determine the outcome.
“Not everybody loves the aspect of politics that occurs on the floor,” he said in an exclusive interview Sunday with The
Washington Post, formally declaring a campaign that many of his colleagues have already embraced. “This is where I
think I can be most useful.”
Schatz, who joined the Senate in late 2012, is the first official candidate to succeed Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois), who
announced last week that he would not run for reelection next year after two decades as whip.
Other potential candidates to succeed Durbin as whip include Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Minnesota), who holds the No. 3
leadership post, and Patty Murray (Washington), the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, who left elected
leadership two years ago after a long run at the table.
Klobuchar declined to comment Monday on whether she plans to run for whip.
“It’s my job to keep us unified and focused on the devastation that has been wrought by Donald Trump’s policies,”
Klobuchar said, referring to her role as chair of the Senate Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, the No. 3 slot in
the party’s leadership hierarchy. “So that is what I’m doing now.”
Schatz, who has been Durbin’s deputy whip for several years, has built a team of loyalists who span the regional and
ideological gamut of the Democratic caucus but skew toward the newer generation of senators.
Helping round up votes for him are Sens. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), who gained acclaim with liberal activists for a
25-hour marathon speech several weeks ago protesting President Donald Trump’s early actions in his term; Mark Kelly
(D-Arizona), the former astronaut and anti-gun-violence leader who was a finalist for the vice-presidential nomination
last year; and Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada), who has preached bipartisan work and won tough Senate races.
“I think he’s going to have very broad support,” Kelly, first elected in 2020, said in a telephone interview Sunday.
Schatz and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-New York) are close, but Schumer has not endorsed a
successor to Durbin yet. Schatz said that he does not expect Schumer’s help in his race.
Durbin told reporters Monday that he had no plans to back anyone in the whip race, though he allowed that he believes
one senator was best equipped to succeed him.
“I don’t have any plans of endorsing because I won’t be voting in that race,” he said.
The Durbin succession race will play out amid the backdrop of a party looking to find its next generation of leaders.
Since early 2005, Senate Democrats have had three figures at the top of their caucus ladder: Harry M. Reid (Nevada),
who spent 12 years as leader before retiring; Schumer, 74, who chaired Democrats’ campaign operation and eventually
succeeded Reid in 2017; and Durbin, 80, who has been their deputy for more than 20 years.
Joe Biden, 82, bowed out as the party’s presidential nominee last year after public appearances suggested he was not
up to the task. A trio of Democrats who are now in their 80s — Rep. Nancy Pelosi (California), Steny H. Hoyer
(Maryland) and James E. Clyburn (South Carolina) — filled the top leadership posts in the House for more than 15
years, before passing the torch in early 2023 to Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) and a team of much
younger leaders.
Last month, after Schumer enraged House Democrats by rounding up support for legislation to fund federal agencies
rather than force a standoff with Trump, some Democrats accused Schumer of being out of touch with that moment.
Schatz, who stayed loyal to Schumer as one of just nine in the caucus to vote to advance the bill, suggested that there is
an “emerging generation in Senate leadership” that he wants to help lead.
Booker, 56, who arrived in the Senate a few months after Schatz, now holds the No. 4 leadership spot. On Sunday, just
before sunrise, he took a spot on the Capitol steps with Jeffries, 54, to begin a daytime session streamed online talking
to activists, some of whom showed up in person, with thousands more watching online.
Schatz views his job, if his colleagues elect him in the secret ballot after the 2026 elections, as trying to elevate other
Democrats and tap into their expertise on issues and their diverse backgrounds.
“One of my tasks is to make sure that they’re all maximally successful. We’ve got lots of talent,” Schatz said.
Kelly, sensitive to the many colleagues who are older and longer tenured, agreed that Schatz is a “spring chicken” in the
Senate but dismissed the “generational thing” as missing the bigger fight right now with the Trump administration.
“That’s the fight we have right now,” Kelly said.
He recounted how, soon after he arrived four years ago, Schatz helped senators like him deal with the grueling “vote-a-
rama” sessions in passing the early phase of the Biden agenda. He advised them how this byzantine amendment
process could help or hurt them politically back home.
“There was one guy in particular who was in touch with what’s going on in our states,” Kelly said.
“I have seen Brian Schatz in action helping get the votes necessary to pass some of the most consequential legislation in
generations,” Rosen said in a statement.
“He’s one of the most thoughtful people I know and represents a new generation of forward-thinking Democratic
leadership. He would make an excellent whip,” Booker said.
Schatz is far from a household name, not someone who makes the rounds on prime-time cable shows or on the Sunday
political news chat shows.
Klobuchar, 64, first elected in 2006, has maintained a higher profile as a 2020 presidential contender who performed
well in debates and nearly won the New Hampshire primary.
Murray, 74, first elected in 1992, has chaired three legislative committees, had two stints overseeing the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee and served more than 10 years in other junior leadership posts.
Schatz has played an inside game, including hiring Durbin’s longtime adviser, Reema Dodin, to prepare him for the
whip’s job. He brought Rosen to Hawaii to raise money for her 2018 Senate race when she was just a first-term
member of the House and stumped for her reelection last year in rural parts of her state.
Late Sunday morning, he showed up at the Capitol to join Booker and Jeffries to denounce Trump.
Schatz has embraced the Hawaii tradition of sending its lawmakers to Congress and expecting them to stay for decades,
bringing home as much federal money as possible.
Schatz succeeded the late Daniel Inouye (D), who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his World War II service and
served nearly 50 years in the Senate, running the subcommittee overseeing Pentagon funding for decades.
“This is the only job I want,” he said of being senator.
Schatz has stayed relatively quiet in terms of diagnosing the party’s 2024 face-plant, but he is beginning to open up
more about the perceptions of how Democrats in Washington have been timid toward confronting Trump.
“A little too much self-punditry. We’ve gotten a little too precious in finding the right tactic,” he said Sunday, pointing
at Booker’s recent actions being largely symbolic but demonstrating his sense of what is at stake. “We should just do it
all, all at once.”
And the Jeffries-Booker session at the Capitol demonstrated how Democrats were, at least for now, past their mid-
March fight over which tactics to deploy against Trump.
“There’s just too much at stake to bicker among ourselves,” Schatz said.",NA
Martine Powers,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/26/2025,LIHEAP in jeopardy as Trump proposes cuts to heating assistance program,"For decades, presidents of both parties have at times attempted to shrink a government program that helps poor
people pay their energy bills, arguing that the program was vulnerable to fraud or that lower gas prices warranted
reduced funding.
Every time, the program has endured because of staunch support from members of Congress and outcry from people
who say the program is vital to their survival.
But now President Donald Trump — with the help of DOGE — is trying to kill the program for good. And he may
succeed.
The Trump administration is seeking to eliminate all $4 billion in funding for the Low Income Home Energy
Assistance Program (LIHEAP), according to internal budget documents for the Department of Health and Human
Services first reported by The Washington Post earlier this month.
Critics of LIHEAP have said the program is susceptible to abuse and hasn’t always demonstrated its effectiveness
compared with other assistance programs. Defenders say that LIHEAP is a lifeline for families who otherwise would
need to choose between heating their homes and putting food on the table, and that killing the program would threaten
Americans’ budgets and in some cases, their lives.
Congress could still reject Trump’s plan. But in the meantime, Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service — otherwise known as
the Department of Government Efficiency — is creating a new reality on the ground.
Earlier this month, HHS, which administers the program, fired all the people who administer LIHEAP — raising
questions about how the program will operate going forward, if at all.
And in the short term, the firings jeopardize almost $400 million in assistance intended to be given out to needy
Americans by the end of the summer. The money is supposed to help people keep their electricity on, to run their air
conditioning and refrigerators. It remains unclear whether those Americans will receive that money.
That’s left people like Jamie Merrill unsure of how they’ll pay their energy bills for the rest of the year.
In Hartford, Maine, where Merrill lives with her six children, it’s been a tough winter. With help from LIHEAP, she was
able to fill her 275-gallon tank with heating oil at the outset of the cold-weather months. But that oil ran out, and so did
assistance from the program, so she had to pay out of pocket for an emergency oil delivery. She worries the LIHEAP
money might dry up altogether.
“I don’t know whose bright idea it is to shut something down that is helping so many people,” said Merrill, who voted
for Trump in the 2020 election.
The staffing cuts to LIHEAP are one example of DOGE’s slash-and-burn approach to government. And in this case,
they seem to have done serious damage to a program that both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have protected
year after year, even in the face of presidential administrations proposing cuts.
Currently, LIHEAP provides help to more than 6 million families. The money is divvied up among states, territories
and federally recognized tribes, using a formula determined by Congress. Those entities are responsible for doling out
the money to their neediest residents.
For many people, that funding comes in a credit to energy companies; recipients get a certain amount of money
deducted from their utility bills each month. In northern states, that money primarily goes to pay for heating, but
increasingly, it’s being used to help Americans in warmer climates pay the electricity bill to run their air conditioning.
The average amount each family receives is about $550 per year, according to Mark Wolfe, executive director of the
National Energy Assistance Directors Association. His organization represents the state officials who help distribute
the funding to recipients and advocates support for the program from Congress.
The stakes of this assistance can be life-and-death. Seniors are especially vulnerable to extreme temperatures. Getting
electricity cut off for failure to pay bills can also be catastrophic for people with disabilities who depend on medication
that needs to be refrigerated. And energy assistance can help low-income parents keep custody of their kids, who are
also especially vulnerable to extreme heat; if parents can’t demonstrate their ability to keep their home at a comfortable
temperature, they can’t make the case their home is safe.
HHS has not provided a clear answer about whether the year’s remaining funding will be delivered to the states. In a
statement, an agency official said, “HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements, and as a result of the
reorganization, will be better positioned to execute on Congress’s statutory intent.”
But the official did not respond to a request for clarification on whether agency leadership considers it a statutory
requirement to distribute the remainder of the appropriated money, and did not indicate who will be responsible for
doling out the money to the states, territories and tribes.
On April 15, Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) wrote to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy
Jr., seeking “specific staffing information” on who is going to be responsible for administering the program in the
aftermath of the layoffs and how services will continue without interruption.
“We are deeply concerned that children, seniors, and working families will be left without assistance for heating and
cooling their homes as a result of your actions,” Wyden and Sanders wrote in the letter.
A staffer for Sanders said Thursday that they had not yet received a response from HHS.
The White House also did not respond to a request for comment about the future of the program and the rationale for
proposing to cut it.
Congress created LIHEAP in 1981, in response to the U.S. energy crisis and Americans’ struggle to keep up with higher
oil prices. Originally, the program largely helped residents of cold-weather states. But, as part of an effort to broaden
its appeal to a wider swath of Congress, the program began to provide assistance to people in warmer climates, where
climate change has turned summer air conditioning from a luxury into a health necessity.
The amount of funding has fluctuated over the years — and in some cases, presidents have sought to lower it.
In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton tried to cut the program in half, before backing off in the face of opposition from
lawmakers representing New England states.
Funding levels went up and down during the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, often in response to
oil prices or economic crises. In 2011, the Obama administration proposed cutting the program’s funding by half, in
light of the end of the recession and lower fuel costs. Ultimately, Democrats and Republicans in Congress overruled the
proposal and kept cuts much smaller. Later on, when fuel prices went up, LIHEAP’s funding increased slightly.
A former senior Obama administration official involved in budget decision-making said that dips and increases in
funding from year to year are normal as circumstances change. The official described the rationale for Obama’s
proposed cut in 2011.
“This was not a decision to eliminate LIHEAP. This was a decision to have funding go up and down to match energy
prices,” said the Obama official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose internal conversations.
Compared with the wholesale elimination of LIHEAP staff that’s happening now, the official continued, the Obama-era
proposed cut “was a different decision, made in a measured way.”
Trump argued for defunding LIHEAP during his first term. The fiscal 2019 budget plan described it as one of several
“low-performing or ineffective programs.”
“LIHEAP is unable to demonstrate strong performance outcomes, and the Government Accountability Office has
raised concerns about fraud and abuse in the program in the past,” the budget proposal said.
In a 2010 report, the Government Accountability Office concluded that “greater fraud prevention controls are needed”
within the agency.
Former HHS staffers who helped administer LIHEAP say that significant improvements to fraud prevention and data
collection had been made since that report came out. Because payments in most cases go directly to a utility company
to provide credits to customers, they point out, there’s built-in oversight.
“There’s very good data out there to show that the money is going toward the purpose it was intended for,” said an
HHS staffer who administered LIHEAP and recently lost their job. The staffer spoke on the condition of anonymity
because they feared retribution from the Trump administration.
Laid-off HHS employees said they were surprised by Trump’s decision to eliminate all staff administering the program,
in light of the bipartisan support in Congress.
“It’s a program that touches every single corner of this country. Everybody knows somebody in their life that has
utilized the program one way or the other,” said another former staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to
avoid retribution from the Trump administration. “I think you’re going to see people lose their homes, lose their
utilities — potential medical issues, death. It’s definitely that large of an impact if the program goes away.”
For the program’s 6 million recipients, the question of whether that funding reaches them in coming months will have
enormous stakes for their household budgets. Already, the LIHEAP program is oversubscribed. The existing funding is
only enough to reach about 1 in 5 eligible households. In some places, recipients must navigate a tangled network of
state and regional entities to get the help they need.
“For someone like myself, it’s medically needed. Without power, I can’t charge my hearing aid,” said Krista, a 69-year-
old resident of San Francisco who started receiving LIHEAP funding during the pandemic, when covid shutdowns
caused her to lose her job. She spoke on the condition that only her first name be used to protect her privacy regarding
her financial circumstances. “Don’t take everything away from us. With this administration, they’re already talking
about attacking Social Security.”
Krista said she has found the heating assistance to be crucial in recent years, even though San Francisco winters are
relatively mild. Her electricity bill during the colder months is about $100.
“That’s high for one person,” Krista said. And she’s noticed that electricity rates keep going up. “We have all these
wildfires, and I feel like we’re being punished for that.”
Now, Krista worries about what will happen if the LIHEAP money disappears. She doesn’t know how she’d pay her
rent, and she might have to skimp on groceries.
Merrill, in Maine, has similarly mixed feelings about whom to hold accountable for the potential impact of an end to
LIHEAP funding. In her case, the amount of assistance she received from LIHEAP this past winter — $672 in credits,
she said — was less than half of what she received the previous year.
She recognizes that it was the Trump administration’s decision to carry out layoffs of the program’s federal staff. But
she was frustrated by how the Biden administration ran the program, too.
“It’s a never-ending battle with all these different offices and utility shutoffs, and I’ve got six kids to feed,” Merrill said
about her LIHEAP experience.
Still, Merrill struggles to imagine what could happen next winter, if the program ends and she receives no further
assistance. Merrill voted for Trump in the past and said she respects his business prowess, but she thinks he doesn’t

Andrew Ackerman;Aaron Gregg,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/21/2025,"Trump renews attack against Fed chair Jerome Powell, calls for rate cuts","Markets fall as Trump renews attack against Fed chair
The president’s latest broadside refers to Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell as a “major loser” and warns
the economy will slow without interest rate reductions.
Updated President Donald Trump renewed his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell on Monday, exacerbating a
stock sell-off and dragging the dollar to a three-year low amid persistent uncertainty about the administration’s
approach to trade and the economy.
All three major stock indexes fell more than 2 percent, with Big Tech, including Apple and Tesla, driving some of the
fall. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down nearly 1,000 points, while yields on Treasurys rose. The prices of
gold and bitcoin jumped.
Shortly after markets opened, Trump referred to Powell as a “major loser” on Truth Social and said the U.S. economy
could slow without an immediate reduction in the cost of money amid the fallout from his trade war.
“‘Preemptive Cuts’ in Interest Rates are being called for by many,” the president said. “Powell has always been ‘To
Late.’”
Monday’s sell-off shows how investors remain uneasy about Trump’s escalating tariffs.
The president has imposed a range of tariffs, including 10 percent tax on most imported goods, plus levies on steel and
aluminum as well as a 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods. Meanwhile, his administration is actively negotiating
separate trade deals with dozens of countries to avoid even steeper tariffs, which are currently on hold.
The uncertainty has led to a sell-off, especially among tech stocks, as the tariffs could significantly hit their revenue,
said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. The extent of the possible damage is not yet clear, with so many trade
negotiations underway.
“This has created an unprecedented environment for tech companies to navigate, and Trump’s Powell comments just
add fuel to the fire,” Ives said. The added uncertainty, Ives said, “has left investors in a dark tunnel with no flashlight.”
Some analysts said Trump’s comments could be seen as an attempt to pressure the central bank or to blame Powell if
the economy slows down.
The Fed is structured to set interest rates free from political pressure from the White House or Congress. The idea is to
insulate monetary policy from short-term political goals, because elected officials often prefer lower interest rates to
spur immediate growth, even if it risks higher inflation down the line, which could ultimately harm the broader
economy.
Four investment analysts told The Washington Post on Monday that the weakening dollar is a reflection of the U.S.
being seen as less of a safe haven, with investors broadly selling U.S. assets and sending their money elsewhere.
“Maintaining the integrity of U.S. institutions is very important to the overall stability of the U.S. and global financial
system, and talk about firing Powell is not helpful for that backdrop,” said Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management
at Horizon Investments.
Trump referenced March inflation data, gathered before this month’s tariffs went into effect, to claim that there is
“virtually No Inflation.” A key gauge of inflation — the consumer price index — showed prices rose by 2.4 percent in
March from a year earlier, which showed progress but was still higher than the Fed’s 2 percent target.
“With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation,
but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,” Trump
wrote.
Monday’s comments are the latest in a series of attacks Trump has leveled against the Fed in recent months as he
continues to push to exert more power over Washington’s independent agencies. On Thursday, Trump blasted the Fed
for not lowering rates and said its chair’s “termination cannot come fast enough.”
That attack came a day after Powell warned that the administration’s trade war was “highly likely” to spur a temporary
rise in inflation, with the potential for longer-lasting effects. Markets soured on Powell’s remarks.
Trump has been unhappy with Powell for not cutting interest rates more quickly, and several Trump allies have
expressed frustration over Powell’s comments about the impact of tariffs on inflation. Some in Trump’s orbit have also
seen the Fed chair as undercutting the president’s agenda and said Powell has done little to solicit the opinion of the
president. Trump has for months mused about firing Powell before his term as chair is up in May 2026, according to
people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private conversations.
The Fed declined to comment on Monday’s rhetorical attack. Powell has said flatly that the president doesn’t have the
legal authority to dismiss him.
The law that created the Fed says a president is allowed to fire Fed governors only for cause — generally malfeasance of
some kind rather than a policy dispute. It is silent on whether the president can demote a top official from a leadership
role. The issue hasn’t been previously litigated, and any effort to dislodge Powell now would probably lead to a legal
dispute that would have to be settled by the Supreme Court.
While some top Trump advisers have previously said the administration will respect the Fed’s independence around
monetary policy, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, on Friday amplified the
president’s displeasure with the Fed leader, saying that Trump is studying whether he’s able to fire the Fed chief.
“The president and his team will continue to study that,” Hassett said when asked by a reporter whether removing
Powell was an option, according to Bloomberg News.
On Monday, the S&P 500 index tumbled roughly 2.4 percent, bringing it more than 15 percent below its late-February
peak.
The narrower Dow Jones Industrial Average also slipped about 2.5 percent, or about 970 points. Meanwhile, the tech-
heavy Nasdaq composite index also fell roughly 2.6 percent Monday as all of the “Magnificent 7” group of Big Tech
companies suffered losses.
Analysts said tech stocks are being swept up in the broader flight of investment capital from the United States.
Investors are particularly concerned that the high-tariff regime could bring about stagflation, said Jamie Cox,
managing partner at Virginia-based Harris Financial Group, referring to a condition in which growth stalls and
inflation rises.
“Ironically, Americans have lost more in buying power of the U.S. dollar than they have gained to date by the
government’s spending cuts,” Cox said. “If this continues, any potential tariff benefit will be overwhelmed by the real
and immediate deterioration of financial conditions caused by a weak dollar.”",NA
Maegan Vazquez;Teo Armus,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/26/2025,Venezuelan couple living in D.C. ordered to be released from ICE custody,"A U.S. district court judge has ordered two Venezuelan nationals living in D.C. to be released from immigration
custody, saying the federal government has failed to provide substantial evidence to declare either of them was an
“alien enemy” warranting removal under President Donald Trump’s order invoking the Alien Enemies Act.
The decision, issued Friday by El Paso-based Senior U.S. District Judge David Briones, marks the first time a judge has
ruled that the Trump administration had erred in classifying someone as an “alien enemy” and ordered a release. Many
of the relatives and attorneys for men the Trump administration has sent to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act
have strongly denied that they are Tren de Aragua gang members. The Supreme Court ruled that the government
needed to give anyone labeled an “alien enemy” a chance to contest that designation.
The judge in El Paso also went a step further in specifying that going forward, the government must provide detainees
21 days to contest their status, and they must be given a notice in a language they can understand. The Trump
administration, in a separate case, recently shared a sample notification form, in which those labeled “alien enemies”
were given 12 hours to state whether they planned to contest that designation.
Briones also barred the removal of any noncitizen being held in federal immigration custody within his district — a
jurisdiction that includes El Paso and several counties along the U.S.-Mexico border eastward into San Antonio and
Austin — under Trump’s order.
Sirine Shebaya, an attorney at the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers’ Guild who is representing the
couple, said Friday’s ruling was the first to address the question of what standard of evidence should apply to the
federal government’s determinations under the Alien Enemies Act — and what threshold the government has to meet
in those determinations.
“That is such a fundamental and critical due process protection,” Shebaya said, “so they have a meaningful opportunity
… to understand what the government is saying about them, and to be able to challenge that in a meaningful way.”
The decision is the latest successful legal challenge to block deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, a previously
little-used wartime law dating to 1798 that allows for the swift removal of those from enemy governments who are at
war with the United States.
The Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that detainees deported under the law must first have an opportunity to
challenge their deportations. Since then, migrants in several federal court districts across the country have filed
petitions to try to block their removal from the U.S. The Supreme Court has not addressed the underlying legal
question of whether the administration has the authority to use the Alien Enemies Act, as the U.S. is not at war with
Venezuela.
Recently, a federal judge also ordered the Trump administration to return a Venezuelan man to the U.S. after he was
sent to El Salvador under the act, the second time the courts had demanded the government bring back a migrant who
had protection from deportation but was sent to a megaprison instead.
The couple ordered to be released from custody Friday, Cesar and Norelia, fled Venezuela in 2022 and were paroled in
the U.S. after crossing the border illegally. (The Washington Post is identifying the couple by their middle names
because they have applied for U.S. asylum and have said they fear for their safety if deported to Venezuela.)
They were granted temporary protected status, or TPS, but have repeatedly been detained by immigration authorities
over the last month, only to be released on court orders. The couple’s lawyers called the arrests a violation of their
protected status and due process rights under the Constitution.
On April 1, the couple received notices terminating their TPS designation because of their alleged “association with a
Foreign Terrorist Organization” — namely, the Venezuela-based gang Tren de Aragua. On April 16, the couple were
taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in El Paso days after they traveled there for a pretrial
proceeding over a misdemeanor charge for unauthorized entry into the U.S. in 2022.
After being detained at the airport, the couple were “repeatedly interrogated, pressured to sign documents and make
admissions regarding issues that intertwined with both their criminal and immigration cases, but without counsel
present,” according to Friday’s order. The notices designating them as “alien enemies” were provided in English, a
language neither of them speaks.
Briones, a Clinton appointee, said in the strongly worded order that representatives for the federal government failed
to provide the court with the evidence required to substantiate the claim that the couple “are members of Tren de
Aragua” and criticized their “shoddy affidavits and contradictory testimony.”
Federal representatives, Briones said, “have been unable to convince the court by even a preponderance of evidence
required, let alone clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence required,” that the two were members of the gang.
“Even assuming President Trump’s TdA [Tren de Aragua] Proclamation is lawful, the Government fails to prove
Petitioners could be properly designated alien enemies under the TdA Proclamation,” he added.
Shebaya said that the husband and wife were released from custody following Briones’s order but that ICE “illegally”
placed ankle monitors on them after their release.
Other Venezuelan migrants who the administration has alleged were members of Tren de Aragua have also sued and
obtained similarly favorable rulings, including in Colorado, New York, Pennsylvania and another federal courthouse in
Texas, Shebaya said.
But this decision, which applies to all cases coming through the Western District of Texas, was the first to establish that
the burden is on the government to back up the designation and the evidence must be “clear, unequivocal and
convincing,” Shebaya said.",NA
Lily Kuo,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/11/2025,Trump's tariff war comes as China suffers an economic slump,"Trump’s tariff blitz could hardly have come at a worse time for
China
Beijing is remaining defiant in the face of President Donald Trump’s trade measures, but it will
have to take some sort of action to shore up its weak economy.
Updated By imposing tariffs of 145 percent on all Chinese goods, President Donald Trump has effectively launched a trade
embargo on the world’s largest exporter.
It could hardly have come at a worse time for Beijing.
Exports have been a rare bright spot in an economy struggling with a property market slump, high youth
unemployment and domestic spending that is so weak it threatens to turn into a deflation crisis.
The hit to exports also threatens the legacy of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who is trying to transform his country from
the world’s factory into an advanced manufacturing and technology superpower — a delicate transition that could be
thrown off by this bruising trade war.
In less than a week, the world’s two largest economies have progressively upped the ante to a point where their
respective import duties are at historic highs. All American shipments to China are now subject to tariffs of at least 125
percent, while the goods that China sells to the United States each year will face a levy of 145 percent.

Trump's trade war
The world’s two largest powers

economic break. Why neither
the United States nor China
want to be the first to blink.

The president’s sights are set squarely on China, which has refused to cave to his demands and said Friday that it was
ready to “fight to the end.” Even as other countries were granted a 90-day reprieve from some of Trump’s “Liberation
Day” tariffs on Wednesday, Beijing was hit with an additional levy, effective immediately. China punched back with
more tariffs Friday, to take effect Saturday.
China produces far more goods than Chinese households or companies can buy, and it exports the rest, resulting in a
global trade surplus of almost $1 trillion last year as it shipped electronics, chemicals, toys and furniture to the United
States and other countries.
“That’s a lot of stuff trying to find a home,” said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, a
consultancy. “China’s economy is more reliant on exports now than at any time during the global financial crisis. We’ve
seen that export demand has become more and more important to sustaining growth in China.”
Now China’s ability to achieve this year’s growth target of “around 5 percent” is in doubt. Citing the tariffs, investment
bank Goldman Sachs on Thursday lowered its forecast for China’s GDP growth this year to 4 percent. Some analysts
are predicting the trade war could cut that rate in half.
Economic data published Thursday showed consumer prices continued to slide in March, a sign that deflation persists
as consumers hold back from spending and businesses drop prices to try to compete for customers.
“So far China has been relatively strident, but the reality is that they are on the back foot,” said Eswar Prasad, a
professor of trade policy at Cornell University.
Electronics, machinery, furniture and toys accounted for more than half of Chinese shipments to the U.S. last year,
according to Chinese customs data. Exporters in China’s manufacturing belt in the south are already feeling the brunt.
Aron Gu, a 27-year-old owner of a family-run shoe-material factory in Guangdong province, said he has lost 80 percent
of his orders in the last three days.
“Not all my clients are in the U.S., but in the trading business, you can’t avoid the U.S. market. In the end, it is the
world’s biggest spender,” he said. With no incoming orders, Gu has put most of his 100-plus employees on unpaid
leave.
“To me, Trump’s tariffs are childish and irrational,” Gu said. “Does he really believe bringing manufacturing back to the
U.S. will benefit the country? All I can say is, this tariff war has deepened my anxiety about the future of my business.”
Chinese officials like to point out that Beijing has had time to prepare for what is its second trade war with Trump, who
raised tariffs on China in 2018 and eventually struck a deal with Beijing in 2020. Today, the U.S. accounts for about 15
percent of China’s total exports, down from almost 20 percent in 2017.
Still, Chinese exports to the United States amounted to more than $400 billion in 2024, or about 3 percent of China’s
GDP, which analysts say is nothing to sneeze at.
“U.S. trade is less important now than it was in 2017, but this does hit the Chinese economy at a very bad time,” said
Joerg Wuttke, former president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.
Another risk for China is that back doors to the U.S. market — routing goods through third countries such as Vietnam
or Mexico — are likely to be Trump’s next target. That means an avalanche of goods will have to find new markets.
“They sell $500 billion worth of goods to the U.S., and they need to sell that somewhere else — to Europe or the Global
South. That is going to mean a tsunami of exports, and they could start seeing trade barriers go up in those other
places,” Wuttke said.
Still, there were signs of optimism in China even after Trump’s 145 percent tariffs went into effect. China’s shares
closed higher on both Thursday and Friday as Trump’s partial rollback of his tariffs lowered the risk of a U.S. or global
recession.
“As long as there’s a stable global economy, Chinese companies can benefit from it,” said Guo Shan, a partner at
Hutong Research, a Chinese advisory firm.
“From Beijing’s perspective at this point, it’s not about competing for exports. Rather, global economic stabilization is
more important, because if we’re having a global financial crisis, it will probably hit China harder than just the tariffs.”
Analysts say that while the hit to exports would hurt, China has the tools to cushion its economy from the worst of
Trump’s attacks by bringing forward or ramping up already planned stimulus. Those measures — child-care subsidies
for families, support for pensions or expanding a trade-in scheme for residents to upgrade their electronics and other
items — could come as soon as the end of this month when a high-level meeting of senior leaders is expected.
An editorial in the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s paper, the People’s Daily, this week suggested other measures
were on the table, like cutting interest rates or reducing the amount commercial banks are required to hold in reserve,
which would encourage more lending to Chinese companies.
“The higher the tariffs, the greater China’s determination to launch a bigger stimulus package,” said Yue Su, principal
economist for China at the Economist Intelligence Unit.
As Trump’s pressure campaign on China continues, analysts expect retaliatory measures that go beyond tariffs. The
president could expand U.S. export controls on things like advanced semiconductors — as the Biden administration did
— or machine tools and biotechnology equipment. This would hit China even harder.
“For China, it is not so much trade as access to U.S. technology that is important,” said Bert Hofman, a former World
Bank country director for China. “If restrictions on technology exports are further sharpened, this would in the short
run be more disruptive for China’s development.”",NA
Victoria Bisset,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/24/2025,India and Pakistan escalate diplomatic tensions after deadly Kashmir attack,"India and Pakistan revoked visas for each other’s citizens Thursday as diplomatic tensions escalated two days after a
deadly shooting attack on a mountain town in Indian-administered Kashmir killed at least 26 people.
Pakistan announced it was suspending trade with India and closing its airspace to all Indian-owned or -operated
airlines, while India’s Foreign Ministry said that all Pakistani nationals were to leave the country before their visas
expired in the next few days. On Wednesday, India had closed the main land border between the two countries and
suspended a key water-sharing treaty — something Pakistani officials described as “an act of water warfare.”
Tuesday’s attack on tourists in a scenic mountainous valley in the Kashmir region, a Muslim-majority enclave, was the
deadliest attack against civilians in the region in more than a decade. The attack outside the town of Pahalgam, which
coincided with Vice President JD Vance’s visit to India, threatens the fragile 2021 ceasefire between India and Pakistan
that ended fighting at the de facto border between Indian- and Pakistani-held Kashmir.
The nuclear-armed neighbors both claim Kashmir and administer separate parts of it; India has long accused Pakistan
of supporting militants in the area it administers.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday vowed to pursue the perpetrators of the attack “to the ends of the
earth,” without identifying them or naming Pakistan. India’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the move to
revoke all existing visas to Pakistani nationals came “in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack” and also recommended
that Indian nationals currently in Pakistan “return to India at the earliest.”
Pakistan has condemned the attack and denied involvement. At a news conference Tuesday, Foreign Minister Ishaq
Dar accused India of a “blame game” without proof. The country’s National Security Committee described India’s
response as “unilateral, unjust, politically motivated, extremely irresponsible and devoid of legal merit.”
India and Pakistan have fought three wars over the disputed territory, and armed insurgents in Kashmir have spent
decades fighting against Indian control. Thousands of civilians have been killed in the violence or caught in the
crosshairs of the dispute.
In 2019, the two countries came to the brink of war after a Pakistan-based militant group claimed responsibility for a
massive suicide bombing targeting paramilitary forces in Indian-controlled Kashmir — prompting India, and then
Pakistan, to launch cross-border airstrikes.
Later the same year, India revoked the semiautonomous status of Indian-administered Kashmir and imposed sweeping
security measures. As The Washington Post has reported, Kashmiris deemed too vocal or too close to separatists have
since been fired, jailed or warned to stay silent.",NA
Christian Shepherd;Vic Chiang,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/16/2025,"China economy grew 5.4% in first quarter, set to slow as tariffs hit","China’s economy got off to a strong start in 2025, growing at a faster-than-expected annual rate of 5.4 percent in the
first three months of the year — a clip that will be difficult to sustain as the trade war with the United States intensifies.
Beijing has a plan, however: It wants Chinese consumers to replace American ones and keep its sprawling
manufacturing industries afloat.
Visitors to Taobao, the country’s biggest online shopping platform, were offered steep discounts Wednesday on
products like electric rice cookers (down from $42 to $25) and 85-inch televisions ($512 instead of $639).
Similar offers popped up on other major Chinese shopping apps: The first thing buyers see is a section of goods
“subsidized by the nation,” part of an effort to encourage people to replace old fridges, laptops and washing machines
with discounted new models — mostly from Chinese brands.
The campaign, launched in January as part of a government swap program, has shifted into high gear since the trade
war began.
“Let us join hands, bring together the wisdom and strength of ‘Made in China’ to light up the galaxy of the domestic
market,” an alliance of 100 supermarkets said in a statement last week, joining a flurry of pledges from government
ministries, cities and companies to find ways to offset the expected slump in American consumers.
Trump presidency
Beijing is scrambling to respond to the shock of President Donald Trump’s triple-digit tariffs, now at a minimum of 145
percent. It has done that in part by maintaining a defiant public stance, including warning “those peasants in the U.S.”
this week that the trade war will backfire and they will “wail in front of the 5,000 years of Chinese civilization.”
On Wednesday, China appointed a new chief trade negotiator, promoting Li Chenggang, a former envoy to the World
Trade Organization, to replace Wang Shouwen, who took part in negotiations with the first Trump administration.
But Beijing is also taking steps to insulate its economy from tariffs by rapidly expanding domestic markets to soak up
the huge array of “Made in China” products that are now effectively blocked from being exported to the U.S.
Thanks to that effort, the domestic market for consumer goods grew rapidly in the first three months of the year. Sales
of communication equipment including smartphones and household appliances grew by 27 percent and 19 percent,
respectively, the National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday.
That helped the economy expand by 5.4 percent in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, the bureau said.
It was also helped by a 6.9 percent surge in exports as international buyers rushed to get hold of Chinese-made
products before Trump’s tariffs took effect. In March alone, China exported $306 billion in goods, up 13.5 percent from
the same month last year.
But even with strong state support, exporters say, it won’t be easy to pivot. That’s partly because Americans spend
more than Chinese consumers: Household consumption makes up nearly 70 percent of U.S. gross domestic product,
compared with less than 40 percent in China.

“We’re still unfamiliar with the domestic market, and that’s been a challenge,” said Stephen Wan, owner of Kaiyue
Garment in Nanchang. Over 18 years in the business, Wan had done little to promote his apparel within China — until
this past week.
Sixty percent of his orders had been from the U.S. — and only 10 percent from China. Now, Wan has begun posting
videos on Douyin, the China-only version of TikTok, and has launched a store on JD.com, another online shopping
giant.
Local governments have also stepped in to help by arranging loans and resolving production bottlenecks. “They’ve been
keeping tabs on how many orders we’ve lost and have offered us advice and assistance,” Wan said.
Analysts expect more state support to be announced as the trade war continues, noting that Beijing had previously
focused its stimulus measures on local government debt, leaving space to ramp up support for households.
“The Trump threat has forced the Chinese government to speed up on raising domestic consumption,” said Keyu Jin, a
professor of economics at the London School of Economics. “It has shown that China’s reliance on exports to stimulate
growth is becoming less potent and actually quite risky.”
In previous efforts to turbocharge the economy, the government tended to focus on construction and manufacturing. It
encouraged investment in factories, railways and skyscrapers. Now, policymakers are urgently trying to do something
much harder: increase demand for Chinese-made goods within the country.
For the past two decades, China’s leaders have said they want to lessen the economy’s reliance on export-focused
manufacturing and shift more toward domestic engines of growth.
But their efforts to boost consumption have met with little success. Household spending has been especially weak since
the pandemic.
But being cut off from the vast U.S. market might force Beijing to redouble its efforts to prevent widespread
unemployment from factory closures.
“Tariffs have a way of forcing a reallocation of resources into exactly the areas which the Chinese government finds
useful,” Jin said. “If anything, the Trump shock has really pushed everyone … to act in concert, which wasn’t
necessarily the case in the last few years.”
Although the campaign to encourage purchases began earlier this year, it has intensified dramatically in recent days.
JD.com announced a $27 billion initiative to help exporters switch to domestic sales by buying up unsold goods and
encouraging companies to join the China-focused platform to tap its huge userbase and logistics network. Baidu, a
leading search engine and artificial-intelligence company, is offering free, AI-generated live-streaming advertising to
sellers.
“China has a massive market of 1.4 billion people, with enormous consumption potential,” said Gao Changchun, head
of the Shenzhen DHCB E-Commerce Research Institute, who has been urging the municipal government in Shenzhen
to offer low-interest loans to businesses.
Ultimately, Gao says, policies encouraging domestic sales will make Chinese businesses more resilient. “The Chinese
economy is like an ocean, not a small pond,” he said, quoting Chinese leader Xi Jinping. “Changes in the external
environment may stir up some waves, but they will not alter the overall long-term positive trajectory of China’s
economy.”
For much of 2024, international economists forecast that China would miss its growth target of “around 5 percent” —
until a flurry of stimulus measures were announced late in the year. The government set the same ambitious goal in
March for this year.
Even before the tariffs, economists were saying the target would be tough to hit, not least because a slump in the real
estate market continues to be a major drag on growth. Investment in the sector decreased 10 percent in the first three
months of 2025, while sales of commercial housing were down 3 percent.
Those deeper problems may undercut China’s strategy for blunting the impact of tariffs. Beijing appears to hope
discounts will deliver a quick bump to retail sales but has not done the hard work needed to make people truly feel
confident about spending more of their income, analysts said.
The announcements fall well short of addressing the structural reforms needed, said Camille Boullenois, a Brussels-
based analyst for Rhodium Group, a research firm.
The Chinese government appears unwilling to take the risk of costly — and politically tricky — structural changes to
social security, bank lending and local government finances during the trade war, she said.
“The government sees itself in this grand competition with the United States where a lot is going to be decided in the
short term, so they are willing to sacrifice the long-term health of the economy for that short-term competition,”
Boullenois said.
Beijing has been here before.
In 2020, just as Trump’s first trade war with China reached an uneasy truce, Xi announced a concerted effort to stop
relying so heavily on foreign buyers and instead boost domestic demand.
That self-sufficiency drive — known as “dual circulation” — was disrupted by the pandemic, high unemployment and a
prolonged property slump. Many households were left worse off and unwilling to spend. Savings rates have soared as
people squirrel away spare cash for the next rainy day.
Levels of concern have been especially high among the middle class in major cities, who were hit disproportionately
hard by regulatory crackdowns on internet companies, after-school tutoring and the property sector.
Even now, consumption remains stubbornly low, and prices keep falling, raising the prospect that China is entering a
deflationary spiral.
The danger for Beijing is that factories keep producing far more than domestic buyers need — and then compete to cut
prices in a bid to encourage purchases.
Prices remained low for the first three months of this year, with an official index that tracks everyday consumer items
like groceries falling 0.1 percent compared with the same period last year.",NA
Cat Zakrzewski;Matt Viser;Emily Davies;Elizabeth Dwoskin,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,5/1/2025,"As Musk steps back, DOGE looks to Congress to finish what it started","Elon Musk arrived at the White House prepared to take a chain saw to the federal government, promising to slash $2
trillion in spending.
A little more than 100 days later, the world’s richest man is retreating from Washington far short of that goal after an
often painful education in the mechanics of the U.S. government.
As Musk prepares to return to his private companies in coming weeks, he and his allies are increasingly pressing for
Congress to take up the mantle of their government cost-cutting. But that effort faces an uncertain future in a largely
frozen Congress that has passed few bills since President Donald Trump took office in January.
In a meeting with reporters Wednesday, Musk boasted about the U.S. DOGE Service’s success but appeared sober
about its future. He estimated the project will save $160 billion in fiscal year 2026, but that tally lacks many specific
details. Musk said those savings are “pretty good,” even though it was only a fraction of his initial promise, which he
said would take a long road to reach.
“How much pain is the Cabinet and this Congress willing to take?” he said to reporters in the Roosevelt Room.
“Because it can be done, but it requires dealing with a lot of complaints.”
Musk said he is planning to meet in the next week with lawmakers in the DOGE caucuses from the House and Senate,
underscoring how his attention has, in part, shifted to finding ways to codify the many cuts and changes he has tried to
make to the federal bureaucracy.
David Sacks, a close friend of Musk and the White House’s AI and crypto czar, said it is now up to Washington
politicians to act on Musk’s findings.
“At the end of the day, in order to capture the savings here, we do need those appropriations eliminated from the
budget,” Sacks said on an episode of the “All In” podcast that aired Saturday. “It’s not up to DOGE to do that. It’s up to
these old bulls in Congress who control the appropriations process.”
States, labor unions, local governments and nonprofit organizations have launched a legal barrage against many of the
Trump administration’s efforts to cut the scale and size of the federal workforce, arguing that Congress needs to
approve these actions. DOGE’s strategy has also always involved seeking favorable decisions in the courts that could
allow the agency to have lasting influence, while bypassing Congress’s role in setting federal spending, said two people
familiar with the development of the initiative, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail the private
discussions.
After early losses in some of those cases, DOGE is also seeking an enduring impact through Congress, which controls
the federal budget and has traditionally been involved in government cost-cutting efforts. Musk on Wednesday said
DOGE has made “more progress” than any initiative since the Clinton administration, which ran a years-long process
to reduce government waste in part through signing bipartisan congressional legislation into law. Multiple judges have
restrained DOGE’s efforts to withhold government funds and dismantle agencies, with some finding that DOGE is
violating the Constitution.
Musk’s move to spend less time in Washington leaves a vacuum atop DOGE — which stands for Department of
Government Efficiency — even though he’s not technically its director, as no other figure at the office wields the same
social media bully pulpit or access to Trump. Musk is expected to remain very involved in DOGE from afar, but he did
not explicitly say who would take the reins as he scales back his day-to-day work. Musk has key allies in the
administration who could continue to support his initiative, including White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen
Miller.
“Is Buddha needed for Buddhism?” Musk said when pressed on the plans for his succession. “Was it not stronger after
he passed away?”
At the Hill and Valley Forum, a conference focused on connecting Silicon Valley and Washington, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-
Iowa) said Wednesday that Congress needed to act to ensure the changes DOGE has made aren’t overturned amid
political changes in the capital. Ernst, the chair of the Senate DOGE caucus, has introduced several bills aligned with
DOGE initiatives, such as updating the Treasury Department’s payment system. Still, she acknowledged the nascent
caucus was entirely composed of Republicans.
“We do have some Democrats that operate around the fringes,” she said. “They just don’t want their names associated
with DOGE right now.”
A Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll conducted in April found that Americans have mixed views on whether the
Trump administration is actually limiting government spending, and Americans increasingly disapprove of Musk. The
poll found that 35 percent of Americans approve of the way Musk is handling his job in the Trump administration,
while 57 percent disapprove.
Many Democrats have used Musk as a foil in their efforts to criticize the Trump administration. But Musk continues to
have allies in the Republican Party, even as some lawmakers raise concerns about cuts that could negatively impact
their states. Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-Louisiana) said he would give Musk’s effort an A-plus.
“He’s a rock star,” said Kennedy, who supports passing legislation that would formalize the cuts that DOGE has made
so far. “He has changed the conversation in Washington.”
While much of the initial focus of DOGE has been on cutting government programs, the project was also intended to
modernize government technology systems.
“With DOGE, it’s either the most mundane systems stuff or they’re deleting entire agencies,” said Sam Hammond, the
chief economist at the Foundation for American Innovation, a group that has made recommendations to DOGE. “My
hope is it snaps back to more of the former going forward.”
A senior White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to detail private plans, said there are discussions
underway about how DOGE can “streamline” inefficient government systems, including conversations with large
companies such as Amazon and Microsoft.
“There are some departments who have used different software, and it’s not compatible with another department
within the same agency,” the person said, explaining that DOGE is working on ensuring different government
databases are working together.
Musk on Wednesday acknowledged that the time he spent at DOGE has come with some personal costs. Tesla, his
electric vehicle company, in April reported a stunning 71 percent plunge in profits compared with the first quarter of
2024. Musk said his experience in the government has been fun about 60 or 70 percent of the time, noting that he does
not like to see people protesting his moves at DOGE by burning Tesla vehicles.
At Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting, Cabinet members clapped for the billionaire as Trump acknowledged the
contributions Musk made in the first 100 days of the administration. Musk tinkered with his baseball hats during the
meeting, stacking his “Gulf of America” hat on top of a DOGE hat.
“Mr. President, they say I wear a lot of hats,” he said. “Even my hat has a hat.”
Going forward at DOGE, some allies expect Musk to adopt tactics similar to those he uses for his businesses.
“The thing that makes Elon uniquely successful is not being a great manager of a complex system,” but rather that he
delegates minutiae to focus on the bigger picture, said a person who has helped craft DOGE’s strategy who was not
authorized to speak publicly. “And he can continue to do that from afar,” the person said.
Over at the Hill and Valley conference in the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center, attendees were optimistic about DOGE’s
performance, arguing that entrenched government systems needed to be broken up with a radical program.
“It’s a forcing function for people to look to do things in a different way,” said Randy Hayes, vice president of public
sector for the AI company Vast. “Things need to be broken up.” He added that he felt empathy for many people who
had lost their jobs.
Some saw the changing landscape in Washington as an opportunity for tech companies to expand contracting beyond
the space and defense industries.
“It feels like it’s sort of a new topic for the government to be thinking about more basic technologies and the way that
they should be looking to commercial industry,” said Delian Asparouhov, a co-founder of the conference and a partner
at Founders Fund, a venture capital firm linked to Peter Thiel.
But some told The Washington Post they thought DOGE’s record was mixed. Few wanted to speak publicly about it.",NA
Karen DeYoung,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/27/2025,"Trump, the self-professed dealmaker, presses difficult negotiations","From negotiations over Ukraine, Iran and Gaza to the dozens of countries he says are seeking U.S. trade and tariff
agreements, President Donald Trump has a lot on his foreign policy plate, even for a man who says he relishes
dealmaking.
He has high ambitions and has set tight deadlines. Two months, as of early March, for a deal with Tehran over its
nuclear program, or he’ll bomb. Weeks or even days left for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine or he’ll walk away.
And early July for global trade partners to avoid massive “reciprocal” tariffs.
Trump “understands the strength of the United States and the amount of influence and leverage we have,” both
militarily and economically, a senior administration official said. “Adversaries understand that … President Trump is
not too timid to use them.” The official spoke on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House.
On Ukraine, Iran and Gaza, the official said, there has been more movement on all sides than there has been for years
“because of the personal engagement of President Trump,” who has been “bold in demanding talks,” the official said.
But so far, despite Trump’s desire to announce major deals as he celebrates his 100th day in office, the rapid success he
promised has been elusive. Even among supporters, there is growing concern that rather than leveraging adversaries
and friends into quick-fix deals for which he can claim success, Trump may be backing himself into corners.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is “playing America as a patsy,” with stepped-up air attacks on Ukrainian civilians
and infrastructure over the past week, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote in an X post Friday.
Trump himself has provided a running commentary of his negotiating efforts on social media and in encounters with
reporters that offer virtually no details and seem to depend on with whom he last spoke. During a week in which he
berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for wanting Crimea back from Russia and called him a man with “no
cards to play,” he also took a gentle jab at Putin, saying he was “not happy” about Thursday’s Russian airstrikes on
Kyiv. “Vladimir, STOP,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social site.
By Friday, as his top negotiator, Steve Witkoff, held his fourth meeting in two months with Putin in Moscow, Trump
indicated all was back on track. “Work on an overall peace deal” was going smoothly, he posted. “SUCCESS seems to be
in the future.”
Just a day later, after a brief conversation with Zelensky in Rome, where both were attending the funeral of Pope
Francis, Trump returned to the Russian attacks. It made him think, he said in another post, that “maybe [Putin]
doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along and has to be dealt with differently.”
Trump has said his only interest in Ukraine is to end the rampant killing, although the deal he has laid out would give
the United States access to critical minerals in Ukraine while lifting sanctions on Russia and giving it most of the
Ukrainian territory it claims.
“The conclusion most people have come to is that when he’s thinking about the war in Ukraine, he’s not thinking about
it on its own, but as an obstacle to his desire to reset U.S. relations with Moscow,” said James M. Lindsay, senior
foreign policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
As he has turned his attention to Ukraine and Iran, Trump appears to have lost interest in Gaza, where during his first
weeks in office he took credit for a brief ceasefire negotiated largely by the Biden administration. Since then, he has
said little about that conflict as Israel has resumed and expanded attacks on the Palestinian enclave. Meanwhile,
humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians has been halted for nearly two months and none of the dozens of Israeli
hostages — nor the one remaining American — has been released.
Asked by reporters traveling with him to Italy whether he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talked about
Gaza in a recent call, Trump said, “We’re taking care of it.”
Meanwhile, on social media, Trump said talks with Iran were “coming out very well.” But a person familiar with the
negotiations said that after two rounds, discussions between Witkoff — who is also managing the Iran and Gaza talks,
in addition to Ukraine — and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had not yet descended below the “30,000-foot”
level.
A third round, held Saturday in Muscat, the Omani capital, was “positive and productive,” a second administration
official said. Separately, a small group of U.S. “technical” experts held their first meeting with Iranian counterparts in
Oman.
Netanyahu has largely maintained silence despite his well-known conviction that negotiations with Iran are useless and
the United States should join Israel in militarily wiping out its nuclear program.
Senior Trump officials have acknowledged that an attack on Iran could spark regional or international conflict. But
they have voiced differing versions of what sort of deal it would take to avoid one, with some saying Iran must
eliminate its nuclear program and others indicating that the goal is to scale it back significantly with assurances and
verification that Tehran will not produce a bomb.
“We’re not at a stage now where we’re going to be making threats or anything of this nature, because honestly, this is
not a president that ran on the promise of starting wars or armed conflicts,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a
Tuesday interview with the Free Press.
But in an interview with Time magazine published Friday, Trump said that if negotiations don’t succeed he would
willingly be at Israel’s side in attacking Iran. “If we don’t make a deal,” he threatened, “I’ll be leading the pack.”
The senior administration official maintained that “President Trump understands … intuitively” the relationship
between military might and diplomacy in ways previous presidents had not. When Trump “is explicit about it … I think
there is a lot of credibility there, a lot of fear there.”
When it comes to a trade war between big powers, however, the White House has fewer levers to push. Trump has said
that his administration has been in talks with Beijing to discuss the 145 percent tariffs he has imposed on more than
half of all Chinese imports — reciprocated at 125 percent by China — and indicated in the Time interview that he has
been in direct contact with President Xi Jinping.
A statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry blasted Trump for “creating confusion,” saying that “China and the U.S.
are NOT having any consultation or negotiation.”
“Of all the countries to be willing to negotiate with a gun to their heads, China seems like one of the worst candidates,”
said Stephen Wertheim, a historian of U.S. foreign policy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
“Trump may think he’s creating pressure on Beijing, but he’s imposed probably more pressure on himself than Xi
Jinping feels,” Wertheim said. “I’ll give Trump credit for pursuing diplomacy aggressively. But Trump’s vision of it, the
way he’s implementing it, involves putting on a lot of timebound pressure to achieve really difficult things.”
As Trump’s self-imposed deadlines near, there are some positive signs. Zelensky is coming under increasing pressure
from European allies, even as they push for more substantive U.S. security guarantees, to sign onto Trump’s “final”
proposal. Iran, despite its bravado in the face of what it has called U.S. “bullying,” is in a military and economic bind
following increased U.S. sanctions and Israeli attacks against its air defense installations and has said the talks are
going well.
Trump has said tariff negotiations with other trade partners are rapidly moving forward, although no results have been
announced.
If success comes, few may care how he gets there. “Most Americans are less enamored with the process the president
follows and more interested in whether the president gets results,” said Lindsay from the Council on Foreign Relations.
“But as I look back at his first term, he had at best a mixed record in negotiations.”
While acknowledging that the president’s tactics are not for the faint of heart, Trump aides cite North Korea,
Afghanistan and the Abraham Accords in the Middle East as markers of the first Trump administration’s successful
dealmaking.
Working from the top down, rather than spending years in bottom-up negotiations, showed what is “indisputably the
better approach,” the senior administration official said.
In 2017, Trump threatened North Korea with “fire and fury like the world has never seen” if it continued nuclear
weapon and ballistic missile tests. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed, in a March 2018 meeting with his South
Korean counterpart, to work toward dismantling his nuclear weapons program and declared a moratorium on testing
— for which Trump took credit.
Trump achieved “the first utterance of a North Korean leader” on complete denuclearization, the senior official said.
But despite two subsequent summit meetings with Kim and what Trump hailed as their “personal” relationship, North
Korea maintains a sizable nuclear weapons program and has increased its ballistic-missile testing and production.
It was Trump who negotiated a deal with the Taliban to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, setting a date of May
2021. But it was Joe Biden who was in office when that date arrived, and the chaotic withdrawal in August of that year
led to the deaths of 13 U.S. service members and a complete Taliban takeover rather than the coalition government the
original deal envisioned.
Any attempt “to try and blame the Trump administration is absurd on its face,” the senior official said.
The Abraham Accords that normalized relations between Israel and four Muslim nations are widely considered a
historic accomplishment, although Saudi Arabia, which insisted on progress toward Palestinian statehood, did not sign
on. A Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank now seems farther away than ever, but Trump told Time he’s
confident that Riyadh, where he will visit on a Middle East trip next month, will “go into the Abraham Accords … very
quickly.”
“I have very good relationships in the Middle East, and I think all over the world,” Trump said. “The smarter people
understand. I have … solved more problems in the world without asking for or getting credit.”",NA
Rachel Siegel,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/6/2025,HUD cuts may hamper government efforts to stop housing discrimination,"The Trump administration’s moves to cut civil rights programs, staff and funding at federal housing regulators are
likely to make it harder for Americans to find safe and affordable places to live and may allow housing discrimination
to go unchecked, according to current and former government employees, fair housing experts, and local organizations.
Much of the concern centers on enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and other civil rights laws, which prohibit
discrimination in public and private housing. Under those rules, the government and private groups can investigate
complaints of segregation, sexual harassment, prejudice against people with disabilities, or other kinds of unequal
treatment. The bulk of that work is carried out by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as well as state,
local and nonprofit agencies that receive federal funding.
But that power is rapidly being eroded and under increasing threat, according to fair housing federal employees who
spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. Cases dealing with alleged discrimination based on gender
identity have stalled, with staffers afraid to keep working on them until they receive clear instructions on how to
interpret terms such as “gender ideology,” referenced in an early executive order from President Donald Trump.
People often call HUD hotlines to ask about their rights, register a complaint or get help in a crisis. But now they can
only do so through an online form, with few exceptions for those with disabilities or who have tech or language
barriers. Regional phone lines shut down in March, according to a HUD memo to fair housing staff obtained by The
Washington Post. Email inboxes aren’t being monitored.
The changes were meant to “maximize efficiency and maintain responsiveness through staffing reductions,” the March
10 notice said. But staff members raised concerns that the moves make it harder for people to get help when they need
it, including people facing eviction or families without a place to sleep.
There are more changes to come. The HUD office that enforces the 1968 Fair Housing Act is expected to be cut by more
than 75 percent as the Trump administration moves to shrink the government, according to internal documents
obtained by The Post. Employees say that will further strain an understaffed office with a hefty case backlog. One
employee said that while the Fair Housing Act requires investigations to be completed in 100 days, “we’re lucky if we
can meet that goal for 30 percent of cases.”
“The level of cuts we’ve heard are on the table would effectively end enforcement of the Fair Housing Act in any
meaningful sense,” said another HUD fair housing staffer. “The fear within the agency is that the administration’s goal
is to gut some of the crowning achievements of the civil rights movement by simply ignoring the laws and refusing to
spend money Congress has appropriated to enforce them.”
In response to questions, HUD spokeswoman Kasey Lovett said the department is reviewing funding for programs and
other expenditures, and “we encourage others to do the same.”
“HUD funding cuts to third parties will not affect HUD’s ability to enforce the laws on the books and serve the
American people,” Lovett said in a statement. “The Department will continue taking inventory to ensure it is
stewarding taxpayer dollars well, while also allocating funding for its intended purpose.”
Yet funding to private groups is on the line. In late February, HUD and the U.S. DOGE Service abruptly canceled 78
fair housing grants to nonprofits, jeopardizing $30 million in congressionally authorized funds. Four organizations
later filed a class-action lawsuit against HUD and DOGE, and in late March, a judge reinstated the funds with a
temporary injunction. The Government Accountability Office — an independent watchdog based in the legislative
branch — is also investigating the cuts to congressionally earmarked funds.
Still, relief came only after the groups — many of which have small offices and depend on federal grants — faced the
prospect of laying people off or closing. Private nonprofits processed 75 percent of complaints in 2024, and they often
say that being embedded in communities makes their work to fight discrimination more effective.
“This is evisceration,” said Gail Williams, executive director of Metro Fair Housing Services in Atlanta. “That’s exactly
what it is. It’s pretty plain. There’s no cover to it.”
When Williams got an email on Feb. 27 saying her organization’s $425,000 enforcement grant was canceled, she knew
that would leave 34 pending investigations in limbo. The grant represents 53 percent of the organization’s annual
budget. Without it, she could keep the 51-year-old organization open for only three more months.
Williams said she is still unsure whether HUD will try to eliminate the money in other ways. She plans to shift her
budget to lean on more local contracts.
At the Central Alabama Fair Housing Center, Kimberly Hobbs has been on edge, waiting to learn whether her group
will lose its enforcement grant. Much of her work involves weeding out complaints that might otherwise clog the legal
system so that she files only verified discrimination claims. To her, the administration’s moves suggest officials aren’t
simply “attacking the law, but attacking the enforcement mechanisms of it.”
“Most fair housing centers right now are uncertain as to how we will continue,” she said.
Staffers working on fair lending, consumer protection and other public interest issues at the Federal Housing Finance
Agency (FHFA) were also put on administrative leave last month. Agency director Bill Pulte rolled out a string of new
directives in recent days, including those paring tenant protections and ending programs that help borrowers lacking
the traditional 20 percent cash down payment required to buy a new home. Staffers said the moves will reduce fairness
and transparency in the housing market, including when it comes to mortgage lending.
In the backdrop, a national housing crisis has made it more difficult for people to find affordable places to live. Trump’s
administration has pledged to make it all easier while also reducing wasteful government spending and cutting the
federal workforce. As part of that effort, HUD’s head count is expected to be cut in half.
Department officials say the projections are in flux and don’t necessarily reflect final numbers. Lovett, the HUD
spokeswoman, questioned how private fair housing groups were using their money and whether their leaders ought to
take pay cuts if they are worried about funding. She also noted that many private organizations aren’t funded only by
the government. In response to questions, FHFA declined to respond on the record.
Many staffers and housing experts say the cuts will indeed make it more difficult for the agencies to carry out basic
duties and that it will keep local groups from on-the-ground work.
“This is the opposite of what voters asked for,” said Nikitra Bailey, executive vice president of the National Fair
Housing Alliance, who noted that fair housing work tends to be bipartisan. “Voters asked for an end to the barrage of
rising costs and affordable housing supply.”
There are also fears that the lack of guardrails brings broader economic risk. Fair lending experts noted that many of
the mortgages that defaulted during the 2008 housing crisis were predatory and disproportionately affected people of
color — risks that can be reduced with proper oversight. Minority borrowers are also more likely to be denied home
loans and to pay higher interest rates.
Advocates say the overhaul will ultimately alienate people seeking help. In Syracuse, New York, Sally Santangelo,
executive director of CNY Fair Housing, said she has been advising people against filing complaints directly with HUD
if they are pursuing them on their own. Instead, she is suggesting state resources if her own group can’t help. Her
organization has a backlog of cases and would normally fill a vacancy for a staff attorney. But she can’t hire another
lawyer in the face of so much upheaval. Her small team is keeping extra tabs on statutes of limitations for their cases to
make sure none slip through.
“We have several cases normally we would be filing right now that we can’t,” Santangelo said.",NA
Emily Langer,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/30/2025,"Former Rep. Bob Filner, San Diego mayor embroiled in scandal, dies at 82","Bob Filner, a California Democrat who served 10 terms in Congress and then won election in 2012 as mayor of San
Diego, a post he held for less than a year before resigning amid a torrent of sexual misconduct accusations, died April
20 at a hospital in Costa Mesa, California. He was 82.
His daughter, Erin Filner, confirmed his death but did not cite a cause.
Dr. Filner — he taught history at San Diego State University for more than two decades — ventured first into local
politics before he was elected to Congress in 1992. Described by the Almanac of American Politics as “one of the most
liberal members of the House,” he was steeped in the tradition of activism.
As a student at Cornell University in 1961, Dr. Filner participated in the Freedom Rides organized to challenge
segregation in interstate transit during the civil rights movement. He spent two months in jail in Mississippi and, years
later, posted his mug shot on his congressional website.
In Washington, Dr. Filner was an early member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and chaired the Veterans’
Affairs Committee from 2007 to 2011. In 2008, he helped win passage of an updated GI Bill providing educational and
other benefits to military service members and veterans.
The following year, he played a leading role in securing approximately $200 million in compensation for Filipino
veterans who had served under U.S. command during World War II but in most cases were denied benefits.
During his time in Congress, Dr. Filner became known for a confrontational manner that at times attracted negative
attention. In 2007, he was charged with misdemeanor assault and battery after allegedly pushing a baggage employee
at Washington Dulles International Airport.
Dr. Filner entered what is known as an Alford plea to a reduced charge of trespassing — maintaining his innocence but
acknowledging that prosecutors had evidence sufficient to win a conviction — and was fined $100.
After the court resolution, the House Ethics Committee dropped an investigation of Dr. Filner but found that he had
displayed “poor judgment” and that he was “responsible for creating a situation that implicated the reputation of the
House of Representatives.”
Dr. Filner did not seek reelection to the House in 2012, instead running for mayor of San Diego, the eighth-largest city
in the United States. He was the first Democrat elected to the post in 20 years.
According to an obituary in the San Diego Union-Tribune, Dr. Filner “upended the status quo across city hall and went
sideways with the entrenched leadership in near-record time.” Among other acts, according to the article, he
hammered out a five-year labor deal with municipal workers and secured funding for year-round homeless shelters.
But Dr. Filner quickly faced an onslaught of accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct. Among the first women
to make formal, public allegations was his former communications director, Irene McCormack Jackson, who in July
2013 filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him. She was represented by lawyer Gloria Allred.
In the lawsuit, the aide accused Dr. Filner of placing her in a headlock, proposing that they be married and asking:
“Wouldn’t it be great if we consummated the marriage?” In other instances, she said, he told her he “would do a better
job if you kissed me” and suggested that she work without wearing panties.
“The past six months turned out to be the worst time of my entire working life,” McCormack Jackson told reporters at
the time. “I had to work and do my job in an atmosphere where women were viewed by Mayor Filner as sexual objects
or stupid idiots. I saw him place his hands where they did not belong on numerous women.”
At least 16 more women lodged complaints against Dr. Filner for alleged offenses that included groping and forcible
kissing. Among his accusers were a retired Navy admiral and a university dean.
Dr. Filner faced mounting pressure to resign, including from all members of the San Diego City Council, the state’s two
Democratic U.S. senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, and Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat then
serving as House minority leader.
He at first refused and underwent two weeks of therapy — “I need help,” he said — before returning to his post. Citizens
began forming a recall campaign. After reaching an agreement according to which the city would pay most of his legal
fees, Dr. Filner resigned in August 2013.
“To all the women I offended, I had no intention to be offensive,” he said in his resignation speech. He also said that
the media, in reporting on the allegations against him, had “played into the hands of those who wanted a political
coup” and claimed that he had been the victim of a “lynch-mob mentality.”
In October 2013, Dr. Filner pleaded guilty to a felony count of false imprisonment and two misdemeanor battery
charges in incidents involving three women. The false imprisonment charge stemmed from an encounter at a political
gathering where Dr. Filner allegedly placed the victim in what became known as the “Filner headlock.”
In the other two instances, Dr. Filner admitted to forcibly kissing one woman and touching the buttocks of another
when she requested a photograph with him.
“This conduct was not only criminal, it was also an extreme abuse of power,” then-state Attorney General Kamala
Harris (D) said at the time.
Dr. Filner received three months of house arrest and three years of probation and was prohibited from seeking elective
office.
Robert Earl Filner was born in Pittsburgh on Sept. 4, 1942, and graduated from high school in Queens. His father, who
ran a scrap metal business, was active in the labor and civil rights movements and became a fundraiser for the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
Under the tutelage of his father, Dr. Filner began studying the works of King and Mohandas K. Gandhi, immersing
himself in the concepts of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience, according to a profile in the publication Voice
of San Diego.
Dr. Filner studied chemistry and the history of science at Cornell, where he received a bachelor’s degree in 1963 and a
PhD in 1973. He received a master’s degree in history from the University of Delaware in 1969.
While teaching at San Diego State University, where he was on the faculty from 1970 to 1992, Dr. Filner embarked on
his political career. He served on the staff of U.S. Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-Minnesota) before joining the San Diego
school board in 1979 and then the city council in 1987.
Redistricting created an open congressional seat in 1992 covering a district that spanned from San Diego to the U.S.-
Mexico border. The Los Angeles Times endorsed Dr. Filner, crediting him with helping to establish drug-free zones
around schools and create low-income housing.
Dr. Filner’s marriages to Barbara Christy and Jane Merrill ended in divorce. According to a death notice placed by his
family in the Union-Tribune, survivors include two children from his first marriage, Erin Filner and Adam Filner; a
brother; and two grandchildren.
In an interview with the Voice of San Diego in 2016, Dr. Filner characterized his ouster from office as “just an attempt
of the establishment to take back their city.”
When asked if he was “sorry about what happened,” he replied:
“Of course, but I mean, I still can’t get into it. I have a few legal things I have got to settle about it, but … as I said, I
gave them the ammunition but they pulled the trigger. They aimed the gun and pulled the trigger. It wouldn’t have
happened to someone else.”",NA
Patrick Marley;Jeremy Roebuck,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/26/2025,How public arrest of Judge Duggan expands Trump’s battle with courts,"Judge’s arrest is latest front in Trump’s battle with the courts
Officers handcuffed Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan in public. Attorney General Pam
Bondi bragged about going after judges who “think they’re above the law.”
Updated The escalating fight between President Donald Trump and the judiciary took a new form Friday.
After weeks of mounting questions about whether Trump was defying court orders, the administration arrested a
Wisconsin judge and accused her of helping a Mexican immigrant evade arrest by federal agents.
Officers handcuffed Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan in public. Attorney General Pam Bondi bragged on the
Fox News show “America Reports” about the administration’s willingness to go after judges who “think they’re above
the law.” FBI Director Kash Patel began the day by announcing Dugan’s arrest on social media and ended it by posting
a photo of agents leading her away.
While many Republican supporters of the president cheered the aggressive actions, critics of the administration said
the spectacle sent a chilling message.
“The obvious purpose of the arrest of Judge Dugan on criminal charges is to intimidate and threaten all judges, state
and local, across the country,” said J. Michael Luttig, a conservative former U.S. appeals court judge.
Many scholars have dubbed the standoff between Trump and the courts a constitutional crisis. Judges have
increasingly expressed alarm at the administration’s dismissive response to orders blocking Trump’s efforts to
dismantle federal programs, fire government workers and fast-track deportations.
The clash has been starkest in the case of Kilmar Abrego García, wrongly deported to a megaprison in El Salvador last
month despite a 2019 order saying he could not be sent to that country. The Supreme Court ruled the administration
must facilitate his return, but the administration has dragged its feet, arguing that it is powerless to bring back Abrego
García because he’s in foreign custody.
Trump has been quick to denounce judges who rule against him, including calling for the impeachment of a federal
judge who ordered the administration not to use a wartime authority to deport alleged members of a Venezuelan gang.
The president’s demand drew a rebuke from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.
Charles Geyh, an Indiana University law professor who studies judicial conduct, said Dugan’s arrest must be viewed in
the broader context of these interactions with the court system.
He called the arrest part of a pattern: “An attempt to bludgeon, an attempt to coerce, an attempt to weaken the one
branch of government that stands between the executive — the Trump administration — and it doing whatever it
wishes to do.”
“These fall into the category of backing the judiciary up against the wall and saying, ‘Nice court system you have here.
I’d hate that you see something happen to it,’” Geyh said.
Trump has tussled with the justice system for years, but his vitriol mushroomed after his first stint in the White House,
as he was indicted on dozens of criminal charges in four jurisdictions.
Impeachment has always been a response to judicial misconduct, not judicial rulings, and Geyh said it is extremely
unlikely that there is enough support in the House or Senate to impeach or remove the judges that Trump has targeted.
Still, he said, Trump’s invocation of the idea puts the judiciary in a dangerous spot.
“When the executive branch and the Republican leaders in Congress call out a judge, it’s not just the mechanics of
impeachment or legislation that the judge needs to be concerned about,” Geyh said. “It is the entourage of followers
that will be threatening the judge’s family [and] the judge’s life.”
Dugan’s arrest fulfilled threats that Trump’s top Justice Department appointees have been making since his return to
the White House — to aggressively challenge anyone deemed to be standing in the way of the president’s immigration
agenda.
Already, the department has sued Chicago; Rochester, New York; and New York state officials over their sanctuary
policies and, in January, launched an investigation of an Upstate New York sheriff’s office that officials blamed for
releasing an undocumented immigrant from custody in defiance of a federal arrest warrant.
Officials established a new “sanctuary cities enforcement working group” to identify state and local laws that the
department could challenge in court. Bondi, on her first day as attorney general, ordered all Justice Department grant
funding to sanctuary cities cut off — a directive that was blocked Thursday by a federal judge in San Francisco.
And as other judges have issued orders restraining everything from Trump’s unilateral attempt to end birthright
citizenship to his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations of accused gang members, Bondi and
her deputies have assailed them on social media and cable TV news.
But even against that backdrop, the decision to arrest and charge Dugan with felony crimes that could send her to
prison for as long as six years marks an escalation.
Prosecutors charged Dugan with obstructing a proceeding before a federal agency and concealing an individual to
prevent his arrest. According to the criminal complaint, the judge became “visibly upset” this month when she learned
federal agents were waiting outside her courtroom to arrest Eduardo Flores Ruiz, 30, who was set to appear before her
on misdemeanor state battery charges.
Dugan sent the agents down the hall to the office of the court’s chief judge, the complaint says. While they were away,
she postponed Flores Ruiz’s hearing and escorted him and his lawyer through a jury exit that leads to a private area of
the courthouse.
That area leads to the public hallway where federal agents were stationed, and the agents soon saw him in the hallway.
One agent rode with Flores Ruiz in an elevator to the ground floor and, after meeting up with other agents outside,
chased Flores Ruiz and arrested him, according to the complaint.
Dugan’s arrest has echoes of a case during Trump’s first term, when the Justice Department in 2018 charged a judge in
Massachusetts with helping an undocumented immigrant escape from a courthouse. Those charges were dropped in
2022 under an agreement that required the judge to report herself to the state’s judicial discipline commission.
Rather than allow Dugan to surrender to authorities — an option routinely offered to defendants who are not deemed
to be flight risks or a danger to arresting agents — federal authorities arrested her at her courthouse.
Craig Mastantuono, one of Dugan’s lawyers, contrasted that approach with Trump’s experience during each of his
indictments, when he was allowed to surrender to authorities at an agreed-upon time. “It’s night versus day,”
Mastantuono said. “It’s normal versus abnormal.”
On Friday evening, Patel posted a photo of Dugan, hands cuffed behind her back, being escorted from the building. “No
one is above the law,” Patel wrote.
Aziz Huq, a constitutional scholar at the University of Chicago Law School, said it’s “wildly implausible” for the
administration to say it’s equally applying the law after Trump granted clemency to people convicted of violent crimes
— including assaulting police officers — during the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
Making Dugan’s arrest a spectacle, he said, appeared to be one of the administration’s goals.
“There is a kind of performative sheen or a performative element to the policy that is about not just the fact of quashing
opposition wherever it might be found,” he said, “but also demonstrating the facts of that quashing through the overt
and open humiliation … of the persons involved.”",NA

Among the meek and the mighty, Catholics bury their
‘people’s pope’
The pope’s unadorned tomb, marked by a single Latin word — Franciscus — was intended, a
cleric said, to reflect a life of “simplicity and essential things.”
Updated VATICAN CITY — The Roman Catholic Church bid farewell to the first New World pope Saturday in a funeral
attended by monarchs, presidents and cardinals but also a different group of guests — an honor guard of migrants,
prisoners, the homeless and transgender faithful who offered white roses to the coffin of a leader who had placed the
marginalized at the heart of his “people’s papacy.”
Under crystal-clear skies in the shadow of St. Peter’s Basilica, the nearly two-hour requiem Mass was a solemn
spectacle of an ancient faith, an elaborate, multilingual ceremony modestly slimmed down at the behest of Pope
Francis, who died the morning after Easter at 88. The most notable difference: a single wooden coffin lined with zinc
as opposed to the three-tiered caskets of cypress, lead and oak used for previous popes.
The changes, official said, were meant to honor the wishes of the first Jesuit pope, who had taken a vow of poverty
and aimed to make the proceedings seem more like the funeral of a pastor than a “sovereign” who had ruled the lofty
Holy See. Before the closing of his coffin Friday night, Francis’s well-worn black shoes peeked out from under the
elegant ceremonial robes of a man who eschewed the finery of his office, including the red slippers of popes.
As dawn broke Saturday over Vatican City, thousands of Catholic faithful poured into St. Peter’s Square. Some
wrapped themselves in national flags — Brazil, Lebanon, Australia — while others carried banners honoring Francis.
Heather Salwach, a 34-year-old health-care professional from Philadelphia, heard about the pope’s death just before
boarding her flight to Rome. “For me, the flight became a vigil,” she said. She arrived at 6:30 a.m. with her mother to
say goodbye to a man she called “the people’s pope.”
“He was our holy father, and as Catholics we feel as if we lost our father. His pastoral approach sometimes got him in
trouble, but for me it was beautiful. He was a man of mercy,” she said.
World
The sprawling crowds spilled over the square through multiple blocks on the streets of Rome and marked the largest
funeral-as-global-event since the death of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II, and the most significant in Vatican City since
the emotional farewell to Pope John Paul II in 2005. The throngs radiated far beyond St. Peter’s Square, with crowds
thick down Via della Conciliazione, the Mussolini-era thoroughfare connecting Vatican City with Rome. They sat on
ledges of Vatican office buildings, stood with obstructed views behind newsstands and on platforms normally used
for restaurant service.
Papal influence has waned over decades, but the still significant power of the church of 1.4 billion Catholics could be
seen in the dignitaries the funeral rites drew, including President Donald Trump, Britain’s Prince William, French
President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, many of whom sat stoically as the
sounds of Latin echoed through the square built by Gian Lorenzo Bernini.
Trump sat in the front row of honored guests that included Macron and Zelensky. Unlike most dignitaries who wore
black, Trump donned a navy suit with dark blue tie.
In addition to the 164 national delegations, other faiths sent high-level representatives to Francis’s funeral. The list
includes Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Zoroastrians, Jains, as well as leaders of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the
Anglican Communion, Methodists, the World Evangelical Alliance and others.
The Vatican said Saturday that authorities estimated the crowd size at the funeral to be around 250,000 people —
far larger than the 50,000 people who attended Pope Benedict XVI’s funeral in 2023, and nearing the 300,000 who
attended John Paul II’s in 2005. Another 150,000 onlookers viewed the coffin during its procession through Rome
to Francis’s burial site, the Vatican said.
“The final image we have of him, which will remain etched in our memory, is that of last Sunday, Easter Sunday,
when Pope Francis, despite his serious health problems, wanted to give us his blessing from the balcony of Saint
Peter’s Basilica,” said Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, dean of the College of Cardinals, who presided over the service
and led an unusual funeral Mass in which a multitude of clerics were invited to co-celebrate.
“Despite his frailty and suffering towards the end, Pope Francis chose to follow this path of self-giving until the last
day of his earthly life. He followed in the footsteps of his Lord,” he added.
Francis, at his request, became the first pope in more than a hundred years to be buried outside the high walls of
Vatican City. His funeral procession moved through the streets on the 3.4-mile route to St. Mary Major, one of the
four papal basilicas in and around the Italian capital that serves as the epicenter of world’s largest Christian faith.
The circuitous procession traversed the Tiber River and symbols of the city’s ancient power, the Roman Forum and
Colosseum, as clusters of onlookers snapped images with their phones.
The funeral day was a juxtaposition of the powerful and the weak. Leaving a square possessed of global leaders and
monarchs, the white popemobile carrying Francis’s coffin arrived at the entrance of St. Mary Major to be greeted by
white-rose-bearing mourners. The final honor guard included Venezuelan, Kurdish, Egyptian and other migrants, as
well as Muslims, transgender people, the homeless and others selected by the Vicariate of Rome as a symbol of the
late pope’s mission of inclusion and outreach. The guests were not brought into the church with the coffin, or for the
burial.
The presence of marginalized people, though, symbolized “Pope Francis’s fight on their behalf,” said Tamara Castro,
48, a transgender woman from Argentina currently living in Rome who has been aided financially by Vatican
charities. She was among those who held roses for Francis’s arrival. “He was a person who was very generous with
us; he opened the door for us, he was always there.”
The Vatican’s live stream cut out soon after the casket, set to be interned in a niche previously used for storage, was
taken inside for a private burial, the costs of which Francis personally arranged to be covered by an undisclosed
benefactor to avoid expenses for the church he served.
As is customary in Vatican City for papal funerals, the presidents of Italy, which surrounds Vatican City, and
Argentina, Francis’s native land, sat in front-row seats to the north of the coffin during the funeral Mass. Reigning
sovereigns filled other privileged seats.
Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrived at the Vatican about 9:30 a.m. They entered St. Peter’s Basilica and
stood side by side at the foot of Francis’s casket, briefly paying their respects, before joining the other heads of state
and government leaders gathered in the square.
Trump has not been openly critical of Francis, but his arrival in Rome came as some in his MAGA camp have
appeared to revel in the passing of a pro-migrant pope who sought to burst open the door of the church he led to
everyone, including LGBTQ+, divorced and remarried Catholics.
Francis and Vatican officials had criticized the Trump administration’s migrant crackdown and aid cuts. During the
funeral’s homily, Battista Re highlighted the pope’s journey to Lampedusa — an Italian island that has become a
symbol of Europe’s migration crisis and repeated Francis’s call to “build bridges, not walls,” a statement that echoed
a criticism the pope had issued against Trump in 2016. One senior Vatican official and funeral attendee —
Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, president of the Pontifical Academy for Life — said “Francis was stronger” than politics.
“I myself am totally against those who will go: ‘They should stay home, because they hindered him!’ No. Pope
Francis [would not be] against this.” He added, “I don’t know why Trump is coming, but certainly Pope Francis’s
testimony has touched him.”
Francis was known for defending Israel before the war in the Gaza Strip, but the country’s leaders were stung by his
criticism of Israel’s military response to the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas. Francis described Israel’s actions as,
responding to “terror with terror.” Israel opted to skip sending a high-level delegation, dispatching its Vatican
ambassador instead.
Italy called thousands of medics and security officials into Rome for the funeral. Arriving pilgrims passed makeshift
medical tents, police officers, hundreds of civil protection officials, and idled ambulances bearing district names
from across the country. One officer showed off a backpack with a bazooka-like attachment for disabling drones.
People inside the piazza said security was appropriately tight, but that organizers managed to keep people moving
forward.
“This is not their first pope death,” said the Rev. Paul Alger, a theology student from Augusta, Georgia.
To an astonishing degree, people of many nations gathered in the square seemed to share a united view of Francis, of
a leader who sought to minister to the poor, of his humility, of his embrace of all. “He was a king, but he didn’t live
like a king,” said Sister Faith Abugu, a nun from Enugu state in Nigeria. “He didn’t carry himself like a big person.
He was available for all.”
“I am not sad at all,” she said. “This is a celebration. He lived a good life.”
The private burial rites Saturday were presided over by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the camerlengo, and attended by
cardinals, other clerics and Francis’s relatives, and involved a blessing of the niche with holy water and ritual sealing
of the coffin. A reproduction of the pectoral crucifix favored by Francis was affixed to the center of the niche,
according to a video of the burial provided by Vatican.
Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, a longtime conservative critic of Francis who served as the Vatican’s chief
doctrinal officer under Benedict, said it was perhaps too much to expect the kind of crowds or religious devotion
evident during John Paul II’s funeral.
“Now is another time … everybody is against everybody, when only the language of power and brutality [is spoken],
and not of friendship, cooperation and respect,” he said.
Müller said it would be for “God” and the “historians of the church” to judge Francis’s papacy, one he frequently
criticized. But, he conceded, “a lot of people, observers, said that the last moral authority worldwide has remained
the papacy, Pope Francis.”
Lithuanian Cardinal Rolandas Makrickas, the co-adjutor archpriest of St. Mary Major, said Francis had long been
devoted to the “Salus Populi Romani,” the church’s treasured icon of the Virgin Mary with child. Francis often
prayed at the icon, and Makrickas had suggested in 2022 that Francis consider burial at the church. Francis initially
declined, believing it customary to be buried in the more lofty St. Peter’s. But he changed his mind, Makrickas said,
after claiming to receive guidance from the Virgin Mary.
The pope chose a simple, single Latin word to mark his tomb — Franciscus, Makrickas said. “He meant for his tomb
to respect and speak about his life — that is, of simplicity and essential things.”

Susannah George;Nilo Tabrizy,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/25/2025,Iranian elite grows supportive of nuclear talks as economic fears spike,"DUBAI — Iranian media coverage of nuclear talks between Washington and Tehran has been largely positive, reflecting
a growing willingness among the Iranian elite to engage with the United States, with even conservative outlets spinning
the negotiations as evidence of their country’s influence on the world stage.
“The balance of power has shifted in favor of the Islamic Republic,” said a recent article in the hard-line newspaper
Javan, which is affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Another conservative daily, Hamshahri, said
Iran had broadcast “a message of authority” in recent talks with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff.
As talks between technical teams from the two countries resume Saturday, analysts say this messaging reveals the
emerging consensus among Iranian officials that engagement with the Trump administration should be a priority —
not because Iran is strong but because it faces the prospect of economic collapse unless sanctions are eased.
“There is certainly a sense that the ground has shifted,” said Gregory Brew, an Iran analyst with the Eurasia Group who
closely monitors Iranian media. “There’s a consensus among the elite that negotiations with the United States to secure
sanctions relief should be a priority,” he said.
Iran’s pro-engagement coalition could be tested as the nuclear talks enter a more detailed phase this weekend in Oman.
Facing years of crippling economic sanctions and escalating military pressure from Israel and the United States,
Iranian negotiators will probably need to consider difficult concessions.
Iranian pronouncements are markedly different from the period leading up to the 2015 nuclear deal, which President
Donald Trump later withdrew from. During that time, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was in conflict
with then-President Hassan Rouhani and went so far to label the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan
of Action, as “sheer damage.” In the end, Khamenei approved the agreement.
The shift began with the election last year of President Masoud Pezeshkian, a largely unknown reformist, according to
an individual with knowledge of Iranian leadership’s thinking. The individual spoke on the condition of anonymity to
discuss sensitive negotiations. Then, following Israeli military operations targeting Iran and its regional allies, support
for engagement began to grow, particularly among Iran’s senior military leadership, the individual said.
The change in thinking wasn’t unanimous, particularly after the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah
chief Hasan Nasrallah, according to Kusha Sefat, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Tehran. He
said one camp leans toward “regional escalation, even war,” and the other advocates for “normalization of relations
between Iran and the U.S.”
“What is particularly significant now is that the supreme leader [Ali Khamenei] has taken up a mediating role between
these two opposing poles,” Sefat added.
Iran’s supreme leader has final say on all major policy decisions, but he also rules through consultation, Brew said.
“There has always been a push and pull among varying interest groups that have differing ideological alignments,” he
said. “Khamenei is personally ideologically aligned with the hard-liners, but he has typically governed through
consensus, following the shape of elite opinion.”
While leaving the door open to engagement, Khamenei remains suspicious of U.S. motivations. In March, he said
negotiations were being proposed by “some bully states” whose real aim was to “dominate and impose their own
expectations.”
Behind the scenes, the president and supreme leader are working in “close collaboration,” according to Sefat.
“Pezeshkian reportedly sought to delay retaliation against Israel during a recent cycle of tit-for-tat attacks, in hopes of
preserving space for negotiations with the U.S. The supreme leader went along with that decision,” Sefat said, citing an
example of their cooperation.
As a candidate, Pezeshkian ran on a platform advocating the pursuit of sanctions relief. After years of trying to build a
“resistance economy,” he said it was time to reengage with the outside world. Mostafa Najafi, a Middle East analyst
based in Iran, said “President Pezeshkian and some other influential political figures were able to create political
persuasion for negotiations” by linking them to the prospect of improved economic conditions.
Pezeshkian also worked closely with Iranian military leaders in adopting an approach of “maximum coordination and
cooperation” and built consensus by “bringing together some influential figures and interacting closely with the
supreme leader,” Najafi said. He called this collaboration “unprecedented.”
In Oman this weekend, Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi are expected to meet briefly, as they have
during the previous two sessions. In the meantime, technical teams will begin the heavy lifting of working out details of
a potential deal that would, at least in part, limit Iran’s enrichment of nuclear material and require greater visibility
into the nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.
Iranian negotiators are seeking that relief to help reverse years of economic decline and hyperinflation. Iran’s currency
continues to hit record lows.
Mahan Hashempour, the owner of Mahan Hamrah, a major consumer electronics distributor in the city of Isfahan, said
an end to sanctions would give businessmen like him direct access to markets outside Iran and undercut the corrupt
monopolies that have flourished in recent years.
“Right now, certain companies have used their relationships with the government and monopoly over the market to
push everybody else out of the mobile phone importation business and they’ve turned into the large importers
themselves,” he said.
Sanctions on Iran’s economy have created a vast, lucrative black market of middlemen who facilitate access to foreign
currency and international markets. The companies charge hefty fees, additional costs of doing business that only those
with close relationships to government officials are able to sidestep.
Now, those people who have been enriched by sanctions are a powerful lobby against negotiations with the United
States, said Hashempour. “If our relations are normalized with Europe, U.S. and the rest of the world, some people
would lose their access to their livelihoods, and this is Iran’s biggest problem at the moment.”
While support for the talks has been on the rise, there remain notable hard-liners who oppose them and who could
become more powerful if negotiations fail to deliver economic relief.
Before last week’s negotiating session in Rome, Hamid Rasaei, a member of parliament close to senior Iranian hard-
liners, railed against the talks. The supreme leader allowed talks “merely to show the extent of the irrationality and
perjury of the [U.S.] officials,” he said. Even as negotiations continue, Rasaei warned, “the sanctions are going to get
harsher, the problems are going to get worse.”

Cleve R. Wootson Jr.;Michael Birnbaum;Rachel Siegel,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,5/1/2025,Trump ran on boosting prosperity. Now an economic bust looms.,"At a Tuesday night rally in Michigan, President Donald Trump, flanked by signs that read “a golden age,” bragged
about his economic policies of the last three months. They will usher in an era of prosperity, he said, that “you won’t
even believe.”
“We will end inflation, slash prices … raise wages, and give you the greatest economy in the history of the world,” he
boasted.
By Wednesday morning, new data showed the first deceleration of the U.S. economy in three years, and analysts said
the country was inching closer to a recession — a contraction, they said, that was the direct result of Trump’s
imposition of tariffs on foreign imports.
Trump has spent this week claiming that his first 100 days have brought unparalleled economic opportunity in the face
of clear data to the contrary. It is not a new strategy for a president who has publicly espoused the mantra of never
admitting defeat.
In the current moment, that strategy does not appear to be working for a president whom voters returned to the White
House largely to address economic concerns, but whose first three months in office have been defined by economic
uncertainty, stock market turbulence and deepening anxiety among business owners, investors and everyday
Americans.
The fallout threatens Trump’s political capital, his agenda and the electoral prospects for Republicans in the 2026
midterms.
Trump presidency
Trump’s economic approval rating is 39 percent positive and 61 percent negative, according to a Washington Post-ABC
News-Ipsos poll published last week. That compares with 45 percent positive and 53 percent negative only two months
ago, before the president had announced most of his tariffs on nations around the world.
Notably, that approval rating on the economy is only two points better than Joe Biden’s 37 percent roughly a year ago.
And it will probably get worse, experts said.
In the three weeks since the tariffs took effect, container ship bookings from China to the United States are down by
more than 60 percent, Ryan Petersen, founder and CEO of Flexport, a global shipping company, told The Washington
Post. Cargo carriers that bring Asian goods to the Port of Los Angeles, the nation’s main Pacific gateway, have canceled
20 port calls next month, more than three times as many as last month, according to port data.
“Damage has been done” that is likely to continue to hurt the economy, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG.
“Some of the disruptions are already in place even if you were to turn tariffs off tomorrow,” Swonk said. Thinking back
to the pandemic and supply-chain snarls that lasted years, Swonk said: “We learn the hard way that things are easier to
close down than they are to ramp up.”
In addition, inflation is widely expected to rise again. The Federal Reserve, which is charged with keeping prices in
check, had managed to wrestle price growth down to normal levels. But now officials are warning that the trade war
will probably undo some of that progress and keep officials from lowering interest rates soon. At the same time, the
Fed is cautioning that it could end up in a bind, with the economy slowing too much but inflation on the rise.
(Normally, slower growth would push the Fed to boost the economy by lowering rates. Rising inflation, though, is
combated with higher rates.)
Households and businesses are under a cloud, too. March survey data from the New York Fed showed that households
think inflation will rise in the short term, their income growth will slow, and their financial situations and credit access
will decline. Home builders, after cheering Trump’s return, are pessimistic about the future as tariffs add thousands of
dollars to their construction costs and immigration crackdowns weigh on their ability to hire.
The job market has so far chugged along, with employees hiring more than expected in March, and the unemployment
rate staying at a healthy 4.2 percent. But drastic cuts to the federal workforce could start to ricochet through the
economy as buyout packages phase out, contractors get cut loose and grantees nationwide lose funding.

Confidence in the stability of U.S. policymaking has long been an advantage that kept borrowing costs lower than for
other countries. But a host of warning indicators suggests that premium is waning. The dollar is losing value against
other currencies. Investors are selling off U.S. bonds amid worries they won’t get repaid. If the damage becomes
broader, voters may eventually punish Republicans the same way they punished Biden.
Trump, who has argued that American industries suffer from international trade agreements, imposed what the White
House labeled “reciprocal” tariffs on 75 countries this month. Amid the economic shock waves and signs of an
escalating trade war that followed, Trump largely reversed course, though he is still standing by a historic tariff of 10
percent for most imports, along with levies on Chinese goods that stand at 145 percent. China has vowed to “fight to the
end” and raised tariffs on U.S. imports to 125 percent, and there have already been economic aftereffects of the trade
war.
Trump recently began to acknowledge the potential for economic pain. At a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, he said:
“Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more
than they would normally.”

But mostly, Trump and his administration have sought to pin the dismal economic figures on Biden — and claimed that
his policies are laying the groundwork for strong economic growth in the future.
“I’m just saying that we inherited a mess,” Trump said at the Cabinet meeting. “It says how bad a situation we
inherited. We came in on January 20. This is Biden. And you can even say the next quarter is sort of Biden, because it
doesn’t really happen on a daily or hourly basis.”
At times, the administration’s language has veered toward the surreal. Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, like
Trump, blamed Biden’s “economic disaster” for the current numbers in a statement issued shortly before the Cabinet
meeting Wednesday. But Leavitt in other ways declined to acknowledge the current economic reality — or the
possibility, if past is prologue, that the public will blame Trump for it.
“The underlying numbers tell the real story of the strong momentum President Trump is delivering,” Leavitt said.
“Robust core GDP, the highest gross domestic investment in four years, job growth, and trillions of dollars in new
investments secured by President Trump are fueling an economic boom and setting the stage for unprecedented
growth as President Trump ushers in the new Golden Age.”
Trump won a second term largely with the argument that Biden’s post-pandemic policies sparked runaway inflation —
and that a ruling class of elected elites was blind to the needs of normal Americans. Trump offered himself as a fast-
acting remedy, pledging palliative economic effects as soon as he took office.
In fact, the economic landscape Trump inherited was relatively rosy, many experts said, outpacing most other wealthy
nations.
“We came into the year performing very well. GDP growth was strong, very different than what we’ve got today. Job
growth was healthy. Unemployment was four percent, and it’s been there for three, four years,” said Mark Zandi, the
chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “We had other countries in the world trying to figure out how to be like the U.S.”
Now the economy is paralyzed by uncertainty, unsettling consumers and businesses as Trump enacts policies, then
reverses them.
“It’s caused everyone to sit on their hands,” Zandi said, “not knowing what to do because they just don’t know what the
rules of the road are.”
Former U.S. House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser, said the president still has time to course correct,
particularly if the positive impact of the tariffs and other policies begin to take effect. If that happens, and if Congress is
able to pass a bill that lowers taxes and helps to improve the economy by summer, most Americans could see their
financial circumstances improved.
“There’s only one question that’s going to matter in the 2026 election: Is it working? If [voters] think it is working,
Republicans are going to win. But it’s going to be choppy and confusing for a while,” Gingrich said.
Trump, for his part, has gone from saying that positive effects of his policies would be evident on Day 1 to encouraging
patience until the end of his second term.
“We’ve stemmed the tide,” he said Wednesday. “We’ve turned it around. But hopefully we’re going to really turn it
around over the next three years. Hopefully, we’ve turned it around to the point where it can’t be destroyed.”",NA
Naftali Bendavid,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/28/2025,"Trump claims mantle of FDR’s first 100 days, but differences are stark","Since Franklin D. Roosevelt’s earthshaking first 100 days in office, no president has matched the sheer drama and
disruption of that 15-week sprint in 1933, which rewrote the relationship between Americans and their government. At
least until now.
President Donald Trump’s opening barrage has similarly upended government operations, disturbed traditions and
even raised new questions about what it means to be American. It is no accident that Trump has repeatedly cited
Roosevelt as a model when it comes to his impact and place in history.
But as Trump’s 100-day mark arrives Tuesday, the differences are at least as stark as the similarities. Roosevelt’s
onslaught, in the depths of the Great Depression, was aimed at expanding the federal government’s presence in
Americans’ lives. Trump’s crusade is aimed largely at dismantling it.
Perhaps more crucially, Congress came together to pass more than a dozen major laws in Roosevelt’s first 100 days,
reflecting the wide national eagerness for his revolution. Trump, in contrast, has governed largely by unilateral
executive action, which enables to him to ignore his opponents but avoids a broad political consensus — and leaves his
actions more vulnerable to reversal.
“Roosevelt spent an awful lot of time trying to craft constitutional justifications in legislation, and draft it in such a way
that the courts might accept it,” said Anthony Badger, a historian and the author of “FDR: The First Hundred Days.”
“He wasn’t trying to do it by executive order.”
Few would dispute that Trump has had a major impact in his first 100 days. He has forced out thousands of federal
employees. He has shut down agencies including the U.S. Agency for International Development. He has imposed far-
reaching tariffs on America’s trading partners. He has eliminated diversity programs nationwide and forced changes on
universities, law firms and corporations.
“In his first 100 days, President Trump has delivered on hundreds of promises and already accomplished his two most
important campaign goals — the border is secure and inflation is ending,” said White House press secretary Karoline
Leavitt. “The next 100 days will consist of trade deals, peace deals, and tax cuts. More American greatness is on the
way.”
But most voters disapprove of his policies so far, including his handling of immigration and the economy, two of his
traditionally strongest issues. Overall, his job approval has fallen to 39 percent of adult Americans compared with 55
percent who disapprove, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll.
And while many of Trump’s actions could have long-term consequences, a future president could instantly reverse
Trump’s executive orders, and in the interim, they face a series of court challenges.
“Roosevelt was putting into place things that lasted for the rest of his century and well into this century,” said Elaine
Kamarck, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution who served in the Clinton administration. “Nothing,
nothing, nothing in these 200 executive orders is likely to last beyond Trump’s term.”
This, of course, is Trump’s second experience with a “first 100 days,” since his two presidential terms have not been
sequential. But in 2017, he often seemed surprised by various aspects of the job and moved more slowly, signing 24
executive orders by this point in his first term compared with roughly 140 so far in 2025.
Arguably the only significant bill to pass so far this year, besides required budget measures, is the Laken Riley Act,
which allows the detention of undocumented immigrants accused of theft-related crimes.
In contrast, Congress passed 16 major pieces of legislation in Roosevelt’s first 100 days, by Badger’s count, often by
overwhelming bipartisan margins. They included such landmarks as the National Industrial Recovery Act, which
created two major new agencies and established enduring rules on union rights and corporate competition.
Trump regularly invokes Roosevelt, sometimes depicting him as a model and sometimes as an adversary.
At a meeting with Republican governors in February, Trump suggested that he and FDR have led America’s political
shifts of the past century. “We’re forging a new political majority that is shattering and replacing Franklin Roosevelt’s
New Deal coalition, which dominated American politics for nearly 100 years,” he said.
As early as June 2017, Trump named FDR as one of the few presidents whose record was comparable to his own. “I will
say that never has there been a president — with few exceptions; in the case of FDR, he had a major depression to
handle — who’s passed more legislation, who’s done more things than what we’ve done,” Trump said.
He also has clearly been intrigued by Roosevelt’s status as the only president to serve more than two terms. In May
2024, speaking to the National Rifle Association, Trump began musing about Roosevelt’s lengthy tenure.
“You know, FDR was a beautiful, had a beautiful patrician voice. Magnificent voice. Great debater. Very smart man,”
Trump said. “You know, FDR — 16 years, almost 16 years. He was four-term. I don’t know, are we going to be
considered three-term or two-term?”
In 1951, as a reaction to Roosevelt’s presidency, the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution was ratified, limiting an
individual to two presidential terms.
Roosevelt was able to accomplish so much so fast because the country was in the throes of an unmatched calamity,
leaving some Americans wondering whether the United States was on the brink of collapse.
Almost 25 percent of Americans were unemployed. The banking system had disintegrated, with some 7,000 bank
failures. Prices had plummeted by 25 percent. Shantytowns sprang up across the country as desperate families cobbled
together makeshift homes.
“The country was in some places unrecognizable,” said David Woolner, professor of history at Marist University and a
senior fellow at the Roosevelt Institute. “There was even the prospect of starvation in places like West Virginia. The
state of Georgia laid off all of its teachers because it couldn’t pay them anymore.”
The economy when Trump took office in January was relatively strong, despite lingering inflation that frustrated many
Americans. Unemployment was at 4 percent and the economy added 143,000 jobs in January, part of a long run of job
growth.
But Trump did not see it that way. As he took office, he declared the U.S. to be in a state of moral, economic and social
crisis that required drastic remedy.
“A radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society
lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair,” he said in his inaugural address on Jan. 20. “We now have a
government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing
catalogue of catastrophic events abroad.”
In his first hours in office, Trump declared an “energy emergency,” allowing him, for example, to ease regulations on
fossil fuels. He invoked emergency economic powers in imposing tariffs on America’s allies and adversaries. He
declared that the U.S. faces an “invasion or predatory incursion” to justify a wave of summary deportations.
Tevi Troy, a presidential historian who worked in the administration of George W. Bush, said Americans can feel they
are experiencing a crisis even when experts do not view it as such.
“At the time, things can feel like a crisis,” Troy said. “That is the way Trump presented things to his voters: ‘We have a
crisis at the border; we have a crisis with China.’ Presidents often present things as a crisis to win votes, but also [to]
justify the actions they are taking.”
Trump and his aides have repeatedly justified his early barrage of actions not just by portraying a country in crisis, but
also by citing a mandate from voters.
But any Trump mandate pales in comparison with Roosevelt’s landslide in 1932, which reflected the public’s deep
thirst for change. Roosevelt garnered 57 percent of the popular vote to incumbent President Herbert Hoover’s 40
percent, and voters handed Democrats overwhelming margins in Congress — 59-36 in the Senate and 310-117 in the
House.
Trump in November fell just short of 50 percent of the popular vote, defeating his opponent, Vice President Kamala
Harris, by 1.5 percent. Republicans have razor-thin majorities in the House and Senate.
It would be a mistake to paint Roosevelt as entirely unwilling to take unilateral action in violation of long-standing
norms, historians say.
He warned lawmakers in his first inaugural address that if Congress failed to enact needed legislation, he would seek
“broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we
were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.”
Like Trump, Roosevelt faced numerous court challenges, prompting his widely panned proposal to expand the U.S.
Supreme Court so it would stop striking down his legislation. And Roosevelt knew how to attack opponents for political
advantage.
“Roosevelt was very good at, without naming them or identifying individuals, talking about the ‘economic royalists’
who were trying to prevent the changes that he wanted,” said H.W. Brands, a historian at the University of Texas at
Austin and the author of “Traitor to His Class: The Privileged Life and Radical Presidency of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt.” “He was good at going after the ‘fat cats of Wall Street,’ for example. He would say, ‘They hate me, and I
revel in their hatred for me.’”
Historians say the conditions leading to Roosevelt’s election may never be repeated. The Great Depression was a
historic catastrophe, and the country has become so polarized in recent decades that a collective push for action like
the one that led to the New Deal seems remote.
Despite that, presidents routinely face pressure to show that they are off to a roaring start within their first 100 days.
“Every administration since FDR feels that: ‘What are we going to do in the first 100 days? What are we going to
accomplish for the American people in that first period?’” said Troy, who joined the Bush administration at its outset.
Kamarck recalled that the Clinton administration dealt with the 100-day mark by reporting progress on the president’s
signature initiatives, including health care and welfare reform.
“The only way that anybody can come close to Roosevelt’s 100 days is if you have massive majorities in Congress,”
Kamarck said. “Of course, we knew that the 100 days would be a metric, no matter how phony it was. We knew the
press would write about it.”",NA
Ellen Nakashima;Alex Horton,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/27/2025,CIA official’s son killed fighting with Russian army in Ukraine,"Michael Gloss, 21, whose mother is a senior CIA official and father an Iraq War veteran, suffered
from mental illness. He died in April 2024 in eastern Ukraine, fighting with Moscow’s forces.
Updated He was a Dylan-loving peacenik who wanted to save the environment, a young man, his father said, who “would not
hurt a flea.” Last April he was killed in Donetsk — one of the few Americans to have fought with Moscow’s forces in the
war against Ukraine.
How Michael Gloss found himself on a Ukrainian battlefield is even more unusual. The 21-year-old was the son of a
senior CIA official and an Iraq War veteran, raised in a comfortable Washington suburb. His father, Larry Gloss, says
Michael struggled for most of his life with mental illness.
“If you knew our son, he was the ultimate antiestablishment, anti-authority young man the minute he came into the
world,” Larry Gloss, who heads a company that provides physical security technologies, said in an interview. At around
age 17, he began to rebel against the “shared values” of his parents, who were national security professionals.
It was with “disbelief and devastation” that his parents, Juliane Gallina — a CIA deputy director for digital innovation
— and Larry Gloss, received the tragic news last June, delivered in person by State Department consular affairs official,
that their son had been killed in Donetsk province in eastern Ukraine, where Russia backed a separatist insurgency in
2014 and invaded outright in 2022, escalating its control of the territory.
Until that point they had no inkling he was in Ukraine, much less fighting with the Russian army. “It was absolutely
news to us that he was involved in any military relationship with Russia,” Larry Gloss said.
Michael died on April 4, 2024, of “massive blood loss” in an artillery barrage, he said, citing the Russian death
certificate. “He died running to aid a wounded comrade, trying to protect him. That was classic Michael.”
The CIA issued a short statement Friday. “CIA considers Michael’s passing to be a private family matter — and not a
national security issue. The entire CIA family is heartbroken for their loss.”
Though the family held a funeral for Michael in December, the fact that he was killed in Ukraine fighting with the
Russian army was not publicly revealed until Friday, in an article published in iStories, an independent Russian
investigative journalism website based outside Russia.
Michael’s spiral began several years ago, when he stopped taking his medications and his behavior grew more erratic.
He started talking about taking a break and “getting off the grid,” and working with an organization dedicated to
organic farming around the world, Larry Gloss recalled. The idea was to take about six months and travel. He left his
home in Fairfax, Virginia, in January 2023 and went to Italy, where he worked on farms, and then eventually to
Turkey, where he helped restore buildings damaged by an earthquake earlier that year.
In June, he went to the former Soviet republic of Georgia, where he attended a “Rainbow Family” gathering, a
counterculture movement inspired by Woodstock, Larry Gloss said. The following month, he texted his parents on
WhatsApp that he had crossed into Russia, saying he was going to meet friends from the group.
“We were on guard, skeptical, suspicious,” his father said. “At no point did he suggest or did we suspect he would join
the military. Never.”
In September 2023, Michael told his parents he wanted to stay in Russia for a while. Unbeknownst to them, that
month, he enlisted in the Russian military, according to iStories, which found a record of his recruitment in a Russian
database that had leaked online.
Tracking his iPhone, they saw he was in a northern Moscow suburb called Avangard, which hosts a military training
center. When his parents spoke with him, he denied being at the training center.
During that period, it was becoming clear that Kyiv’s counteroffensive in southern Ukraine, backed by U.S. advice and
weapons, was failing to make a substantial dent in Russian defenses.
In December 2023, Michael was sent to the Ukraine front, according to iStories, which interviewed a Russian soldier in
the 137th Airborne Regiment who said he knew Michael and told the news site that the American was assigned to an
assault unit. At that time, the 137th Regiment’s units were stationed northwest of the city of Soledar in the Donetsk
region.
Months later, with exhausted Ukrainian forces on their back foot, Russian forces pressed the initiative, moving to
capture the besieged citadel of Bakhmut.
On the day Michael was killed, his division said on Telegram it had advanced in the area, backed by small assault
groups and artillery, despite the “severity of the landscape and unfavorable positions.”
It was only later, in trying to contact people who may have been in touch with Michael, that his older sister reached a
Rainbow friend who shared their text message exchanges, Larry Gloss said. In one, Michael told the friend that “I won’t
be in combat” and that he would be in a “support unit in the back,” his father said. He texted his friend that in six
months, he would have Russian citizenship.
Michael, his father said, apparently wanted to become a citizen, believing that only in Russia could he realize his dream
of building a water purifier to help people who didn’t have access to clean water.
“I can only attribute it to his mental illness,” he said. “It clearly defies logic.”
Gloss said he and his wife were devastated to learn that he had fought with the Russians. “I pray he didn’t hurt
anyone,” he said.
“For the parents, it’s just a great tragedy,” said Ralph Goff, a former senior CIA official in charge of operations in
Europe and Eurasia who has traveled extensively in Ukraine.
Several thousand Americans have gone to the battlefield seeking to fight for Ukraine, said Goff. “Some are war tourists
who leave quickly after their first encounter with modern artillery and drones. Others are determined warriors who
stay and fight.” He estimated that 2,000 to 3,000 fall into the latter category, though there are no public official
numbers.
At least 75 Americans have died fighting on the Ukrainian side, said Meaghan Mobbs, the president of the R.T.
Weatherman Foundation, a U.S. nonprofit that helps repatriate the remains of U.S. citizens there.
By contrast, only a small number have fought with the Russians, according to U.S. intelligence officials and Goff. “It’s
onesies and twosies,” Goff said. “It’s so rare it makes news.”
The Russians tend to use foreign volunteers in assault units, and they’re considered expendable, Goff said. “They just
take all these guys and send them to the front as cannon fodder.”
Michael’s family learned on Dec. 4, the day he would have turned 22, that his remains would be repatriated from
Moscow.
“Our biggest fear while we were waiting for him to be repatriated was that someone over there [in Moscow] would put
two and two together and figure out who his mother was, and use him as a prop,” said Larry Gloss.
He was cremated the week his body was returned.
The obituary published in November did not mention the war or Russia. It said simply, “With his noble heart and
warrior spirit Michael was forging his own hero’s journey when he was tragically killed in Eastern Europe.”",NA
Michelle Ye Hee Lee,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/18/2025,Japan and South Korea tread a fine line in U.S.-China trade war,"TOKYO — As President Donald Trump targets allies and foes alike with tariffs in his quest to reshape the global trading
system, China sees an opportunity to drive a wedge between its neighbors Japan and South Korea and their security
ally in Washington.
But Tokyo and Seoul are not interested — at least for now, focusing instead on convincing the Trump administration to
roll back the new measures.
“We are deeply concerned that the tariffs could have a major impact … on the Japanese economy, businesses, the lives
of our citizens and even the global economy,” Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said in an interview with The
Washington Post on Thursday.
“Japan’s basic stance is to strongly request that the United States reconsider its series of tariff measures,” Kato said.
Japan and South Korea are facing 10 percent blanket tariffs while negotiations take place, as well as 25 percent levies
on steel, aluminum and car exports, all of which are critical to both economies.
A Japanese delegation has been holding talks in Washington this week. Trump inserted himself directly into the talks
Thursday, later claiming the two sides made “big progress.”
South Korea’s trade delegation is expected to meet with Trump officials next week.
As they hope to reach favorable deals, both Tokyo and Seoul need to strike a balance between Washington and Beijing:
They depend on the U.S. for security, but they also rely on China as their largest trading partner.
Beijing is trying to tilt its neighbors in its direction.
Chinese state media said this week that Beijing doesn’t oppose countries’ negotiating with the U.S., but it warned
against doing so at its expense.
“China’s position is very clear: Other countries’ decisions to either retaliate against or negotiate with the U.S. are
matters of their own sovereignty, and China has no objections,” according to Yuyuan Tantian, a blog affiliated with
state broadcaster CCTV. “But if anyone uses China’s interests as a token of allegiance to the U.S., China will never
accept it.”
Japanese and South Korean officials say their priority is convincing the U.S. to roll back the new measures. As they try
to cut a deal with the Trump administration, the two governments may offer to invest in a major natural gas pipeline
project in Alaska and to lower nontariff trade barriers, analysts say.
Kato declined to comment on China’s charm offensive, saying he wants to communicate with other Group of Seven
nations and other Asian countries about the impact of U.S. tariff policies.
The direct and indirect impacts of the tariffs could have ripple effects throughout Japan and globally, he said.
Japan also needs to analyze the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on its domestic markets, Kato said. Both Tokyo and
Seoul have raised concerns about a flood of cheap Chinese goods as Beijing looks for new markets for the $400-billion-
plus in products it usually sells the U.S. each year.
Japanese and South Korean experts acknowledge that Trump’s tariffs may lead the two nations to work more closely
with China in some areas, such as green technology, joint research and investment in advanced technologies. And they
note that the calculations in both capitals may evolve.
But they say a coordinated trilateral response is a political and security risk that sends the wrong message to
Washington at a time when Tokyo and Seoul want to strike a deal with Washington, not alienate it.
“If we send a message that South Korea, China and Japan are joining forces to counter the U.S., that’s a burden not
only for South Korea but also Japan,” said Wonseok Choi, a South Korea-China trade expert at the government-
affiliated Korea Institute for International Economic Policy.
“We need to maintain a balance. For South Korea, if we lean to one side, the diplomatic and economic risks are
enormous,” he said.
Japan’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement: “We have no intention to address tariff measures by the U.S. jointly with
China.”
South Korea’s acting president, Han Duck-soo, also flatly rejected the idea of joining economic forces with China and
Japan, telling CNN this month: “We will not take that route.”
Plus, South Korean businesses have been scaling back their investments in China since 2023 because of rising
competition there, said Ahn Ho-young, former South Korean ambassador to the U.S. and a trade expert.
“There seems to be a gap between market reality on one hand and expectations in Beijing on the other hand,” Ahn said.
Shin Oya, chief analyst at the Sojitz Research Institute in Tokyo, said Japan also remains wary of siding too closely with
China, given Beijing’s history with economic coercion and Tokyo’s concerns over China’s unfair trade practices.
“We have to look closely at China’s actions, not what China is saying. Putting all of our eggs in China’s basket is
dangerous,” Oya said.
Japan’s cautious approach
Since 2010, when China blocked the export of rare earth minerals to Japan during a territorial dispute, Japanese
policymakers have tried to decrease supply chain dependence on China, including by encouraging businesses to shift
production out of China, particularly to Southeast Asia.
“That was a wake-up call for Japan,” said Rumi Aoyama, a China expert at Waseda University in Tokyo. “Starting from
there, Japan has tried to diversify its economic ties.”
Meanwhile, repeated Chinese incursions into Japanese airspace and territorial waters have raised political and military
tensions. The detention of Japanese citizens in China, including employees of Japanese companies based there, has
further strained ties.
Nonetheless, China wants the three exporting powers — which together account for more than 20 percent of the
world’s GDP — to move forward on a free trade agreement. The trade talks began in 2012 but have stalled amid these
geopolitical disputes.
But there’s little appetite in Tokyo and Seoul to seriously ramp up negotiations anytime soon. Experts note there are
already two regional trade agreements that do not include the U.S. — and that for now, that’s plenty.
One is the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the China-led trade pact among 15 Asia-Pacific
countries. The other is the 12-member Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership
(CPTPP) aimed in part at countering Beijing’s influence, which Trump pulled out of during his first term.
China has applied to join CPTPP but faces skepticism from member countries concerned about its trade practices.
Beijing would need to clear the bar for CPTPP first before Tokyo considers entering any new deal with China, said Oya,
of the Sojitz Research Institute on Tokyo.
In the meantime, China might try to entice closer economic relations by offering to eliminate its tariffs on Japanese
and South Korean cars, said Xing Yuqing, economics professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in
Tokyo.
Xing said the three countries need to act together as victims of U.S. protectionism.
“Trump’s ‘America First’ policy would have a very positive impact on enhancing China’s leadership in Asia-Pacific
economic cooperation,” Xing said. “Now is the best opportunity for cooperation among China, Japan and South
Korea.”
South Korea seeks balance
Like Japan, South Korea is not rushing to expand in the Chinese market just yet. Seoul has also preferred negotiations,
viewing retaliation as counter to its interests as an export-dependent economy, said Lee Seungjoo, a trade expert at
Chung-Ang University in Seoul.
Many South Korean companies have already moved manufacturing to Southeast Asian countries, which have also been
hit by Trump’s tariffs — raising the stakes for Seoul to reach a “win-win” solution with Washington, Lee said.
“The first thing that South Korea needs to do is focus on negotiations with the United States,” Lee said. “South Korea
doesn’t have plans to use the framework of the South Korea-China-Japan cooperation to respond to the tariff war.”
Another reason for Seoul’s reluctance is political. The South Korean public soured on China in 2017, when Beijing
retaliated harshly against Seoul for agreeing to install a U.S. missile defense system, including by forcing a South
Korean conglomerate to shut its stores in China.
While potential backlash from China is a concern for Seoul, it also would not be in China’s interest to retaliate against
economies trying to seek a balance because coercion could push capitals closer to Washington, analysts said.
“If China starts taking abusive steps like economic coercion, it will be doing the same thing that China is criticizing the
United States of doing now,” said Choi, of the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy.",NA
Claire Parker;Louisa Loveluck,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/24/2025,Israeli military takes responsibility for attack on U.N. house in Gaza,"The admission confirmed Post reporting that the blasts were caused by Israeli tank shells. The
Israeli military previously denied its troops were involved.
Updated JERUSALEM — Israeli tank fire was responsible for a deadly strike on a U.N. guesthouse in the Gaza Strip last month,
Israel’s military said Thursday, reversing its repeated denials of involvement in the attack, which prompted the United
Nations to significantly draw down its international presence in the enclave.
The March 19 attack on the compound in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza killed Bulgarian aid worker Marin Marinov, 51,
an employee of the U.N. Office for Project Services (UNOPS), and badly injured nine other people, including six
international staffers.
“According to the findings collected so far, the examination indicates that the fatality was caused by tank fire from IDF
troops operating in the area,” the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement Thursday, describing preliminary findings
from an internal investigation. “The building was struck due to assessed enemy presence and was not identified by the
forces as a UN facility.”
In response, UNOPS said the IDF’s initial findings were “consistent with known facts to the UN.”
“Full accountability must be ensured with respect to the grave violations of international law that have been
committed,” UNOPS said in a statement. “The killing of any aid worker is a clear breach of humanitarian law.”
The admission Thursday confirmed reporting earlier this month by The Washington Post, which found the explosions
at the guesthouse were very likely caused by two Israeli tank shells, based on consultations with experts who analyzed
exclusive photos of the scene. CNN also found munitions fragments consistent with an Israeli M339 tank shell.
The IDF previously denied its troops were involved. “Contrary to reports, the IDF did not strike a UN compound in
Deir el Balah. The IDF calls on media outlets to act with caution regarding unverified reports,” the military said in a
statement March 19.
A day later, when The Post shared the coordinates of the guesthouse with the military to inquire further, the IDF media
desk said that “there was no military activity at that time and location.”
On the morning of March 19, UNOPS employees arrived at the house in central Gaza to examine damage to the roof,
which had been “impacted” in an incident the previous night while the building was empty, per an internal U.N. memo.
About 11:30 a.m., as the UNOPS group sat outside after finishing its work, a shell appeared to burst in the air, killing
Marinov and injuring the others, according to two U.N. staffers and a third person, all of whom were briefed on the
incident. Two minutes later, another inbound shell punched a hole in a second-floor exterior wall and exploded inside,
they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. The Associated Press published a
graphic video of the aftermath, in which a person appears to be lying on the floor of the patio in a pool of blood.
At The Post’s request, three munitions experts reviewed the video as well as 10 photos showing damage to the
compound and more than a half-dozen individual munitions fragments. They concluded that the damage was
consistent with two Israeli tank rounds and that the fragments seen in the photos were very likely from at least one
Israeli-made M339 high-explosive, multipurpose round.
Satellite imagery examined by an expert showed at least one Israeli tank, along with other military vehicles, positioned
a little more than two miles from the guesthouse before and after the strike.
The U.N. temporarily evacuated 30 staffers, a third of its international workforce in Gaza, in the wake of the strike,
citing its inability to guarantee the safety of its personnel. The reduction in force came as Palestinians in Gaza face a
spiraling humanitarian crisis after Israel imposed a total blockade on aid entering the enclave in early March, in what
aid organizations, rights groups and even Israel’s staunch European allies have warned is a violation of international
law.
“The locations of all UN premises are known to the parties to the conflict, who are bound by international law to
protect them and maintain their absolute inviolability,” U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said in a statement
shortly after the attack. At least 280 U.N. employees have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war there in
retaliation for the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, he added.
Responding to Guterres’s remarks days later, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein wrote on X that
“the initial examination found no connection to IDF activity whatsoever” and accused the U.N. of “baseless slander.”
A month later, the IDF admitted its tank fire was to blame and said it “regrets this serious incident and continues to
conduct thorough review processes to draw operational lessons and evaluate additional measures to prevent such
events in the future.”
“We express our deep sorrow for the loss and send our condolences to the family,” it added.
The full Israeli military investigation will be completed in the coming days, the IDF said, and the full findings will be
presented to U.N. officials.

Catherine Belton,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/24/2025,"U.S. peace deal could boost Russia, damage Ukraine","Russia is presenting itself as potentially open to a U.S.-sponsored peace deal — even one that doesn’t meet all of its
maximalist conditions — as a way to ingratiate itself with President Donald Trump and lay a political trap for Ukraine,
Western officials and Russian analysts say.
Moscow’s apparent adoption of a more conciliatory tone appeared to be working after Trump told reporters in the Oval
Office on Wednesday that Russia had agreed to a deal and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was more
difficult.
According to several people familiar with the agreement, the United States has put forward a proposal that would rule
out NATO membership for Ukraine, include U.S. acceptance of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, leave the Russian
army with nearly all of the territory it has taken so far and not give any real security guarantees for Ukraine. The
elements would be deeply damaging to Zelensky if he accepted.
The path to any agreement, however, is still fraught, especially after Trump condemned Russia for launching a massive
bombardment of Kyiv early Thursday that killed at least 12 and wounded dozens of others, and Trump envoy Steve
Witkoff is expected in Moscow for further talks on Friday. “I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not
necessary, and very bad timing,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
But Russia’s tactics otherwise appeared to be effective: Trump blamed Zelensky for undermining peace talks after the
Ukrainian president expressed doubts about a number of the provisions, including de facto recognition of Russia’s
control over Crimea — a provision one U.S. official called “a poison pill” for the Ukrainian leader, speaking on the
condition of anonymity to talk frankly.
At first glance, the U.S. proposed agreement would appear to fall short of Russian officials’ maximalist demands, which
include dismantling the Ukrainian state and taking full control over the four Ukrainian regions on the front line —
Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk — that it has claimed. But Western officials and Russian analysts say
that Moscow realizes the proposal would be politically destructive for Zelensky, opening the way for Russia to take
more of Ukraine later, and so are open to backing it.
Since Putin declared a 30-hour Easter truce over the weekend, Russian analysts and members of the elite have
emerged to say that the Kremlin could agree to drop its maximalist war aims — at least temporarily.
“Putin could change his tactics,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow with the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “I
don’t exclude that Putin could agree. He can see this as a transition period. He needs political change inside Ukraine,
and nothing will stop him from waiting and achieving that.”
“The political risks are much higher for Ukraine than for Russia,” she added. “These are colossal compromises for
Ukraine. For Zelensky it is the beginning of the end and nothing will stop Russia from saying in a year that the peace
agreement has been broken by Ukraine and therefore we have to return to our initial demands” of taking control of the
Ukrainian state.
Agreeing to many of the elements of the U.S. proposal — especially if there are no clear security guarantees — would be
politically damaging to Zelensky and create an opening Moscow could exploit to destabilize Ukraine and undermine his
hold on power.
It would also open the way for Putin to blame Zelensky for any future violation of the agreement, said Sergei Markov, a
Kremlin-connected political analyst.
Even if Ukrainian authorities blamed Putin for any breach, “Who do you think Trump will believe: Putin or Zelensky?
Of course he will believe Putin,” he said.
The Russian maneuvering comes after Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio all
indicated that the U.S. administration’s patience was beginning to wear thin over the apparent intractability of a
conflict that Trump initially said he could solve within 24 hours.
“The Russians are anxious to please Trump — or what you could call play Trump,” said a European official, who like
others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. “They want to portray Ukraine as the bad guy,
and with Trump it might be realistic,” he said.
“They have recognized that for now Russia maybe can’t advance militarily and there has to be some change of tools,” he
added.
The shifting approach in Moscow comes as Russia’s military advance in Ukraine appears to have stalled and as
Western sanctions take an ever greater toll on the economy. For months, interest rates have been at a sky-high 21
percent to rein in rampant inflation of nearly 10 percent, and recently falling oil prices are cutting into Russia’s ability
to fund its war machine.
Economists and European officials have argued that the United States would have far greater leverage were it to further
tighten sanctions rather than offer concessions such as handing Moscow the 20 percent of Ukrainian territory it has
seized during the full-scale invasion.
“It is strange that the U.S. is only pressuring the victim, not the aggressor,” the European official said.
Russia has been angling to reset relations with Trump’s America to end its isolation from the West while deepening
fissures in the transatlantic alliance. A faction of Kremlin strategists has been pushing for Putin to take advantage of
the U.S. pressure against Kyiv before the American president turns his attention elsewhere, the official added.
“Russia needs to be seen as constructive enough on Ukraine that Witkoff can persuade the president to reset relations
even if Russia doesn’t give him what he wanted in Ukraine,” the U.S. official said.
Trump’s display of anger after Putin suggested at the end of March that Ukraine should temporarily be placed under
U.N. control to elect what he called a more “competent” government “was a wake-up call that was received in Moscow,”
said Thomas Greminger, head of the Geneva Center for Security Policy and former director general of the Organization
for Security and Co-operation in Europe.
Greminger cautioned that while Moscow may have opted for taking a more conciliatory line in talks with the United
States, he believed the sides were still far from any breakthrough.
Russian analysts added that Moscow is also seeking to ensure that any deal would result in an end to U.S. weapons
supplies to Ukraine. “Trump needs a ceasefire so he can stop military supplies to Ukraine,” Markov said. “And the
signing of such a ceasefire would be a good reason for Trump to lift sanctions against Russia.”
One part of the U.S.-proposed deal that might still be tough for Russia to swallow is the presence for European and
non-NATO forces to monitor any ceasefire, according to people familiar with the plan. Russian officials have flatly
stated this would be unacceptable, in particular troops from NATO countries.
The idea that Russia could freeze the conflict — and still benefit — was touted in a memo written by strategists at the
Institute of World Economy and International Relations, or IMEMO, for the Kremlin at the end of January, according
to a copy of the document obtained by a European intelligence service and reviewed by The Washington Post.
In the memo, the strategists proposed that Russia could parlay “an unspoken recognition of the status quo in Ukraine”
and de facto control over the occupied Ukrainian territories into a partial lifting of sanctions and an easing of “anti-
Russian rhetoric.”
Two senior IMEMO officials, Alexander Dynkin and Feodor Voitolovsky, visited the United States this month and
sought to present a more friendly Russian face during meetings with academics, according to a person familiar with the
visit. “They communicated a willingness to compromise” and sought to portray Ukraine as only one small element in
the discussion in the U.S.-Russia relationship, the person said.
Reached by The Post, Voitolovsky denied that the memo seen by The Post could have been written by anyone at
IMEMO and said he was against any freezing of the conflict.",NA

upper hand
President Donald Trump will increase the tariff on Chinese goods to 104 percent at midnight
Wednesday. But Beijing is showing no sign of buckling to pressure.
Updated President Donald Trump is set to increase the minimum tariff on Chinese goods to 104 percent at midnight on
Wednesday, but Beijing is betting it can stare him down with a simple strategy: retaliate, then sit back and wait.
While about 70 countries targeted in Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff blitz last week are angling for a deal, the
administration says, Beijing has done the opposite: Instead of rushing into high-level talks, it has promised to continue
retaliating by any means available while trying to cushion its economy.
“The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a
statement Tuesday. “China will never accept it. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.”
The world’s two largest economies are locked in a rapidly escalating trade war that could cause a global recession and
push their rivalry to a new level of confrontation.
China believes it has the upper hand.
“Some people here believe that we should not seek negotiations right away,” said Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of
International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, who was part of a delegation that met with U.S. academics and
officials in New York and Washington in February.
Chinese officials have long said that a trade war will only hurt the American economy. The last week of market turmoil
and cracks in support for Trump’s tariffs have further cemented the view that Beijing need only wait a little longer for
backlash to build, according to Wu.
“By then Trump will be under a ton of pressure and is maybe willing to negotiate with China, and by then China will be
in a better position to bargain,” he said. “If we offer to negotiate right now, that plays into Trump’s hands.”
Trump presidency
Trump on Monday threatened to impose an additional 50 percent tariff on China if Beijing did not withdraw the 34
percent retaliatory duties it announced Friday, matching the figure the president issued last week. That came on top of
the 20 percent Trump had already levied, meaning the minimum tariff on Chinese goods could soon be 104 percent.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Tuesday that the tariffs would rise to 104 percent at midnight
on Wednesday.
“It was a mistake for China to retaliate. When America is punched, [the president] punches back harder,” Leavitt said
at a briefing Tuesday. “That’s why there will be 104 percent tariffs going into effect on China tonight at midnight.”
Although China is projecting confidence, it faces significant constraints in its response: For one, its economy was not in
great shape even before Trump unleashed his tariffs. And second, China exports far more to the United States than it
imports, meaning Beijing cannot match Trump’s tariffs dollar for dollar.
“China’s leaders recognize they are asymmetrically vulnerable to an escalating trade war,” said Ryan Hass, an expert on
Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. “But they do not believe they have an exit ramp
[and] will not tolerate being publicly pressured into submitting to Trump’s will.”
China, under strongman leader Xi Jinping, has a lot to lose from a spiraling trade war. The Chinese economy has just
started to turn the corner from a prolonged property market slump, weak spending and high youth unemployment.
Chinese businesses and employment would inevitably take a hit.
As such, Beijing’s end goal is still to negotiate with Trump, analysts said. “They are trying to use retaliation to push the
U.S. to negotiate,” said Henry Gao, a trade expert at Singapore Management University.
“These measures are mostly for political show to tell everyone that China is not afraid of the U.S.,” he said.
In the meantime, China has been steadily expanding its kit of retaliatory tools to make up for the fact that it runs a
large trade surplus with the United States.
These include sanctions on U.S. companies operating in China and restricting U.S. access to key materials needed to
make high-tech products, including medical equipment and nuclear reactors. Beijing could further restrict other kinds
of rare earths or critical minerals of which China dominates production.

progress on campaign promises and legal challenges to his executive orders and

“China left itself some room,” said Sun Chenghao, a fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at
Tsinghua University in Beijing. “If we want to ratchet up controls, then we can.”
Officials are considering further retaliatory measures, according to well-connected nationalist bloggers. These include
banning the importation of American movies, investigating more U.S. companies operating in China or suspending
cooperation on curbing the flow of fentanyl into the United States.
“We have not closed the door to negotiations, but we will not take chances, either. Instead, we have made all kinds of
preparations to deal with any impact,” said an article on Niu Tanqin, an influential blog run by a former journalist with
the state news agency, Xinhua.
Even analysts who predicted Beijing would be more aggressive than other countries have been surprised by the scope
and force of China’s retaliation against Trump.
“China seems to be saying: ‘You’re crazy. You can’t just do this to us,’” said Leah Fahy, a China economist at Capital
Economics, a consultancy. “It signals the leadership is relatively confident that the Chinese economy can deal with the
tariffs, at least in the near term.”
Beijing has said that it is ready to unleash further measures to stimulate its economy if the tariff war threatens the
government’s ambitious growth target of “around 5 percent” for the year. Some analysts are predicting the trade war
could cut that rate in half.
The People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, said Sunday that authorities’ attempts to
“vigorously boost” consumer spending could be dialed up to “extraordinary” levels.
Banks could spur more lending by cutting interest rates, and the government could issue special treasury bonds, the
paper said.
“They’re essentially saying they’re willing to spend loads more this year, which can help prop up growth,” Fahy said.
Economists are debating when exactly China will step in with significant support. Some argue it will wait until later in
the year, while others say it could intervene as early as this month.
Officials are already taking steps to shore up confidence in Chinese stocks, which have been buffeted in the past week.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, where many Chinese exporters are listed, fell 13 percent on Monday, its steepest one-
day decline since the Asian financial crisis of 1997.
But after the “national team” of major state-owned investment firms — with lending support from China’s central bank
— started buying shares Tuesday, markets on the Chinese mainland and in Hong Kong rebounded.

Beijing has also allowed its currency to weaken slightly, to the lowest rate since September 2023. Trump has often
accused China of gaining an unfair trade advantage through currency manipulation that lowers costs for Chinese
businesses.
A major devaluation, although unlikely, is among the most destabilizing moves for international markets that China
could make to protect its economy. Beijing appears to be sending a message to Trump that this is still a possibility,
analysts said.
But for now, Beijing is preparing for the long haul.
“Chinese leaders know the ultimate goal [for Trump] is decoupling, so the game is to steel themselves for that ultimate
outcome,” said Yanmei Xie, an independent expert on Chinese politics. “If the U.S. is not even in a dealmaking
mindset, then caving doesn’t bring you anything. The only choice is to adapt.”",NA
Michelle Ye Hee Lee;Christian Shepherd;Steve Hendrix;Amanda Coletta,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/3/2025,China promises to retaliate against Trump’s ‘bullying’ tariff,"China, E.U. prepare countermeasures as Trump tariffs unite
friends and foes
Allies and adversaries alike were reeling from Trump’s tariff blitz, with some signaling they were
ready to retaliate, while others were still hoping for talks.
Updated SEOUL — U.S. allies and adversaries were reeling Thursday from President Donald Trump’s blitz of tariffs, with
officials from Beijing to Brussels united in outrage and confusion and vowing to retaliate.
In France, President Emmanuel Macron called for companies to pause investments in the United States. China pledged
retaliation against Trump’s “typical bullying.” Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba warned that the tariffs would
have “significant repercussions” on the global economy.
Stock markets in Asia and Europe fell Thursday after Trump levied sweeping global tariffs on Wednesday, although
some recovered losses during the trading day.
Analysts warned that the measures risk strengthening China’s hand.
“This decision, which is so unprincipled, so abrupt, so profound in its impact, calls into question what kind of partner
the U.S. will be,” said Susannah Patton, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Lowy Institute, an Australian
think tank. “It will play into China’s narrative that the U.S. is an unreliable, distant partner that can come and go.”
In Europe, most governments held back on specific countermeasures. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer promised to
respond with “cool and calm heads.” But beneath the diplomatic restraint simmered anger and fears of spreading
economic chaos.
Robert Habeck, Germany’s outgoing economy minister, warned that the U.S. “tariff mania could trigger a spiral that
could also drag countries into recession and cause massive damage worldwide.”
European Union officials said they would hold trade talks with Washington in hopes of replacing the tariffs with a less
punitive umbrella deal. E.U. ambassadors met Thursday to prepare phased countermeasures, which are likely to
include new tariffs on U.S. goods and efforts to boost alternatives to American products, a senior European
Commission official said.
“We love soybeans, but we can get them from Brazil; we do not need to get them from the United States,” said the
official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. “We like Harley-Davidsons, but we
also like Moto Guzzi or we can buy Yamaha, right?”
Trump left the United States’ top two trading partners, Mexico and Canada, off the list of “reciprocal” tariffs announced
Wednesday. Both are grappling with previous tariffs imposed by Trump in recent weeks.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum expressed relief that her country was spared in the latest round.
“Mexico has been respected, by the United States and by the whole world,” she told reporters Thursday, attributing the
exemption to the relationship her government has built with Trump.
In Canada, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that he would match Trump’s tariffs on foreign autos that went
into effect at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, levying a 25 percent duty on U.S.-made vehicles that aren’t compliant with the U.S.-
Mexico-Canada Agreement, the free-trade deal that the countries brokered during Trump’s first term. The duties will
also apply to non-Canadian content in vehicles imported from the United States under that agreement. They will not
apply to auto parts.
The levies come on top of retaliatory tariffs that Canada had imposed on more than $42 billion worth of U.S. goods
earlier this year. Carney said the new counter-tariffs could raise close to $5.7 billion, which would be used to support
businesses and workers.
“Our old relationship of deepening integration with the United States is over,” he said at a news conference in Ottawa.
With Wednesday’s announcements, Trump increased the levy on Chinese exports to the United States to 54 percent,
from 20 percent. He also slapped duties of 24 and 25 percent on Japan and South Korea, respectively — both are key
U.S. security allies and major trading partners — and 32 percent on Taiwan.
But he also targeted many of the countries that had benefited from efforts, encouraged by the U.S. across
administrations, to diversify supply chains away from China: Cambodia was stung with a 49 percent tariff, Vietnam
with 46 percent, and Thailand, 36 percent.
'Reciprocal' tariffs announced by the White House
10% 20% 30% 40%
In the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday, Trump said the U.S. has been “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered
by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike.”
The size of the tariffs stunned U.S. allies in particular.
“We are bewildered,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a senior fellow at the Institute of Security and International Studies
at Chulalongkorn University in Thailand, an American treaty ally.
“It’s worse now to be a U.S. ally than to be an adversary. As an adversary, at least you know what you’re getting,”
Thitinan said. “To be an ally and then be treated like an adversary … that is not expected; it’s not nice.”
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, whose country got off relatively light with a 10 percent blanket duty,
offered a similar sentiment. “This is not the act of a friend,” Albanese said.
British manufacturers, while chilled by a 10 percent increase in duties, were also heartened that the United Kingdom
ended up on the lighter end, raising hopes that Britain’s “special relationship” with Washington may yet spare it the
worst of Trump’s economic salvos.
The E.U., which was hit with a 20 percent blanket tariff and is finalizing its first round of retaliation to U.S. steel tariffs,
is ready to respond with additional countermeasures if talks with Washington fail, said the head of the bloc’s executive
branch, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
“There seems to be no order in the disorder. No clear path through the complexity and chaos,” she said in a statement.
Addressing her “fellow Europeans,” she added, “I know that many of you feel let down by our oldest ally.”
Von der Leyen also warned of possible spillover from other markets, as industry leaders worry that a U.S.-China trade
war could prompt Beijing to divert cheaper goods to the continent, creating unwelcome competition. “We will also be
watching closely what indirect effects these tariffs could have. Because we cannot absorb global overcapacity, nor will
we accept dumping on our markets,” she said.
The tariffs are particularly onerous for China, the world’s second-biggest economy and the target of much of Trump’s
ire as it ran a nearly $1 trillion trade surplus with the United States last year.
The new tariff of 34 percent on Chinese goods comes on top of the 20 percent levy already imposed as Trump accused
Beijing of not doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl and its precursors into the U.S. It is also in addition to existing
tariffs on goods including some appliances, machinery and clothing that were already as high as 45 percent.
China’s Commerce Ministry condemned the tariffs, pledged unspecified countermeasures and noted that many
American trading partners shared Beijing’s dissatisfaction.
“As Trump’s big tariff stick threatens the world, it pushes the United States’ allies to talk to China,” said Ma Bin, an
associate professor at Fudan University in Shanghai. “This driving force is really obvious.”
Analysts said Beijing is likely to retaliate with additional tariffs on politically sensitive U.S. exports such as agricultural
products, while expanding export controls on key raw materials and intensifying regulatory pressure on American
companies.
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has not yet directly engaged with Trump to negotiate tariffs, relying instead on a well-honed
retaliatory playbook to ride out the onslaught.
“Xi is playing the long game: avoid concessions, absorb the hit, and bet Trump blinks first,” said Craig Singleton, senior
China fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank.
China wants to negotiate, but it held back after earlier tariffs because it expected those were “just the hors d’oeuvre, not
the main course,” said Henry Gao, an expert on trade at Singapore Management University.
Trump also signed an executive order Wednesday to close the duty-free trade loophole for small packages, an action he
said is necessary to prevent synthetic opioids from entering the United States. Goods will now be charged 30 percent of
their value, or $25 each, effective May 2, a move that will affect shipments from online retailers such a Temu and
Shein.
But China was hardly singled out. Taiwan’s executive branch called the measures “seriously unreasonable.”
Just how disruptive the sweeping duties are for allies will depend on enforcement and potential exemptions, analysts
said. The White House listed carve-outs for industries like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals that may provide relief
for partners such as Taiwan and South Korea.
Japan and South Korea view the tariffs as an opening salvo in negotiations. Cars from the two countries, home to
Toyota, Honda, Hyundai and Kia, were already set to be hit with the 25 percent tariff on foreign-made vehicles and
auto parts that came into effect early Thursday.
Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba gave his most forceful response to date, saying his government had
“repeatedly requested” a review of the tariffs, which he called “extremely regrettable” and one-sided. But Japan has few
options to hit back, and retaliatory tariffs would be difficult for Tokyo to levy, experts say.
In Seoul, acting president Han Duck-soo convened an emergency task force Thursday to discuss countermeasures.
Trump’s tariff policy could push Japan to look to other countries to decrease its dependence on America, including
increasing trade with China, said Keisuke Hanyuda, former Japanese trade negotiator.
“Japan relies heavily on the U.S. for security,” Hanyuda said. “But if Japan starts to see Trump’s stance as unreliable
on that front, then it would be a totally different story.”
Beijing appears to recognize this vulnerability in Tokyo and Seoul.
After a previously scheduled meeting of the three countries’ trade ministers on Sunday, Chinese state media said they
agreed to coordinate supply chains and hold talks on export controls in response to the U.S. tariffs. Tokyo and Seoul
swiftly played down that characterization, saying the three had agreed to continue cooperating broadly on economic
and trade matters.

Yvonne Wingett Sanchez;Patrick Marley,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,5/1/2025,Trump wants voters to prove citizenship. Arizona tried that and bungled it.,"PHOENIX — For 30 years, no one questioned Danny Dobosz’s citizenship when the lifelong Republican cast his ballot.
So when a letter arrived from a local election official last month asking him to send back a copy of his birth certificate
to prove he was an American citizen who was eligible to vote, he tossed it in the trash at his home in Yuma, Arizona.
Dobosz, an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump who was born in New Mexico, said he had “no real ambition”
to verify his legal status to anyone — even if his ability to vote is jeopardized.
“It’s their duty to prove I’m not,” said the 48-year-old owner of a water-softening business.
“I know I’m a citizen. I pay my taxes,” he said. “Obviously we’re citizens — it’s on their end to fix it, not our end.”
If Dobosz and about 200,000 other Arizona voters don’t provide citizenship documentation, they will not get to vote in
next year’s race for governor. State officials last year discovered they had failed to keep records confirming whether
about 4 percent of the state’s 4.4 million registered voters were citizens, and they’ve been hustling to fix the problem
ever since. They have set off on a scramble that has prompted incredulity, hostility and suspicion from longtime voters
like Dobosz who are now learning they are among those caught in the state-caused voter registration blunder.
Trump and Republicans, who have claimed without proof that large numbers of noncitizens are illegally casting ballots,
are pushing for similar policies nationally. It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, and the
glitches with Arizona’s registration system illustrate the risks of enacting policies that may keep eligible voters from
participating in the democratic process.
The unfolding situation here in Arizona foretells the challenges GOP-led efforts in other states could soon face and
shows the perils of a broader push by Trump and other Republicans to tighten regulations that force voters to
demonstrate they are citizens.
Three states in recent years — New Hampshire, Louisiana and Wyoming — have adopted proof-of-citizenship laws, and
others plan to join their ranks this year. The U.S. House recently passed legislation that would extend documentary
proof of citizenship requirements to all states, but its prospects in the Senate are unclear.
Trump, meanwhile, signed an executive order in March aimed at requiring people to provide citizenship documents
when they register to vote. A federal judge blocked part of his order last week while she considers legal challenges to it.
Most states have people sign statements declaring they are citizens when they register to vote, but Arizona requires
them to submit documents proving they are citizens. Last fall, election officials discovered they had erroneously
classified about 200,000 voters as having proved their citizenship even though there was no record that they had.
These longtime voters got their initial driver’s licenses decades ago, before a state law went into effect requiring
residents to provide citizenship documents when they applied for licenses. State computer systems wrongly tagged
them as having shown that information when they got replacement licenses.
Now, local election officials are asking a skeptical public to prove their citizenship to continue voting in all races on the
ballot. Republicans are more affected because of the party’s registration advantage in the battleground state. The
inaccuracies in the records were unknown to ordinary voters, including more than a dozen who spoke to The
Washington Post about their experiences.
Many thought they were being contacted by mistake. To some, the letters from election officials appeared to be a scam
to obtain sensitive records and came amid a bewildering barrage of actions from Trump’s administration that included
attempting to access private Social Security data. Others said they suspected government officials or political
operatives were seeking retribution against those of the opposing party.
They said they supported ensuring that only citizens vote but most felt inconvenienced by the policy.
“It’s a little annoying,” said Tiffany, a Yuma Republican who said she voted for Trump and spoke on the condition that
her full name not be used for privacy reasons. “There’s so much fighting between the Republicans and the Democrats,
now we’re having to jump through hoops to vote.”
Joseph Preciado, a Republican from southern Arizona who declined to say whom he voted for last year, appreciates the
scrutiny. He said he would find time to present his records to officials in person since he doesn’t trust the mail.
“Jus sanguinis and jus soli,” he said, invoking the Latin phrases referring to citizenship through ancestry or place of
birth.
Secretary of State Adrian Fontes (D) has said state officials acted quickly once they learned of the problem, which was
decades in the making. He and other officials attributed the problem in part to a lack of investment in state computer
systems. Fontes and Gov. Katie Hobbs (D), who oversees the state’s Motor Vehicle Division, have said they will ensure
similar problems don’t surface again.
The White House said states should make it easy for voters to provide citizenship proof but should not abandon such
requirements.
‘It’s going to hit a lot of voters that will be surprised’
Only citizens are allowed to vote in federal and state elections, and voting or attempting to vote by noncitizens is rare.
In recent years, Republicans have argued there aren’t enough checks to ensure voters are citizens, and they have
embraced requiring voters to show birth certificates or other documents proving citizenship when they register to vote.
In most places, voters sign statements declaring they are citizens when they register. Noncitizens who falsely sign those
statements can face criminal charges and deportation for falsely signing that paperwork — deterrents that election
experts cite as keeping voting by noncitizens to a minimum.
Arizona goes further than most states. In 2004, voters adopted a ballot measure requiring residents to prove they are
citizens when they register to vote. After years of legal fights, the Supreme Court in 2013 ruled the state could not
require voters to provide proof of citizenship in federal elections under the National Voter Registration Act.
In response to the ruling, state officials set up a bifurcated voter registration system to require proof of citizenship to
vote in state and local elections, but not federal ones.
When election officials learned last fall that they had no record that a swath of longtime voters had provided proof of
citizenship, they turned to the state Supreme Court. The court allowed the voters to cast ballots in November because
there was too little time to update voter registrations. After the election, local officials developed plans to alert the
200,000 voters they needed to update their registrations if they want to vote in all races.
As Republicans in more states consider adopting registration laws like Arizona’s, they may find the policy dampens
GOP turnout more than Democratic turnout, said Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute.
Wealthier and better-educated voters are more likely to have easy access to citizenship documents and more likely to
be resolute about voting, he said.
“I think the Democrats may have some pleasant surprises ahead, because they’ve lately been doing better with those
groups of voters,” he said. “And the Republicans have seen their base move toward people who are not as committed to
the voting process.”
Democrats don’t see it that way. In court, they argued the citizenship requirement in Trump’s executive order would
subject low-income voters aligned with the Democrats to onerous reviews that would inhibit their ability to vote.
Joshua Douglas, a University of Kentucky professor of election law, called proof-of-citizenship laws “the next big
litigation battle” over voting but said it’s too soon to know how they could affect turnout or each party.
“If it’s implemented in a stringent way, I think it’s going to hit a lot of voters that will be surprised,” he said.
‘Who knows what he’s going to do with those records?’
In Yuma County, a heavily Republican area along the border with Mexico, voters of all stripes said they had misgivings
about mailing personal documents to County Recorder David Lara, a Republican who took office this year and helped
inspire a widely debunked film that alleged the 2020 election was fraudulently stolen from Trump.
“He’s an election denier,” said Allison Engler, an independent voter who said she voted for Trump.
“Who knows what he’s going to do with those records?” she recalled asking friends after she got the letter. “We were
thinking he’s probably going after independents and Democrats.”
Engler’s letter landed in her mailbox a day after Trump signed his executive order attempting to require new voters to
prove citizenship. She at first thought the letter from the county was tied to Trump’s efforts and was put off by the
letter’s faded ink and confusing jargon. “It looked so janky,” she said. “It just went back in my pile of stuff.”
Days later, she concluded it was legitimate but then faced another problem: She didn’t have immediate access to her
birth certificate, and a health condition prevented her from going to her storage unit to rummage through boxes to find
it.
“I have to cajole somebody else to go with me,” Engler said.
Lara said his office has been inundated with calls from angry constituents.
“Some, they’re veterans and now they’re upset because why do they have to prove their citizenship when they went to
war to protect their country and are citizens?” Lara said. Other people have called his office wrongly accusing
“Republicans of pulling this out of thin air,” he said.
“Right now, I’m on my way to my office because there’s a man, 75 years old, who is really angry,” Lara said. “I’ve got to
go back and deal with him and explain: We didn’t cause this problem.”
Lara declined to say how many of the estimated 5,000 people he sent letters to have proved citizenship.
‘No one’s ever asked for them’
Candice Orduño-Crouse, a Yuma attorney and Democrat born and raised in Arizona, received a letter last month. It
frightened her.
“It just all became very suspect,” she said. “I cried. You hear these stories of people being purged from voter rolls or
being questioned about their citizenship. I probably shouldn’t have been so naive but I didn’t think it would happen to
me.”
She worried election officials would not accept a credit-card-size birth certificate issued decades ago, so she paid $50 to
get a modern version. Instead of showing the certificate to Lara — whom she does not trust — she provided it to state
officials.
In ruby-red Mohave County, hundreds of voters have called to complain about the letters, County Recorder Lydia
Durst (R) said. Older voters have told staff they do not have their records. “They’re like, ‘I don’t have that,’ or ‘It’s going
to cost me a lot of money,’” she said.
In Coconino County, a Democratic area north of Phoenix with many Native American residents, Recorder Aubrey
Sonderegger (D) said most voters are being civil about the situation. But the process is drawing an avalanche of visits
and calls from agitated constituents from both sides of the political spectrum.
Maricopa County — home to Phoenix and most of the state’s voters — plans to send notifications to affected people
after local elections in May, said Sam Stone, a top aide to the Republican county recorder. Those who do not prove
citizenship status will be classified as “federal only” voters, he said, until they demonstrate their status.
Georgia Valdez, 67, has been struggling to figure out how to get a copy of her naturalization papers since getting a letter
from the Yuma County recorder last month. She came to the United States from Mexico when she was about 2, was
naturalized when she was in 8th grade and said she has voted for decades.
“I’ve never had trouble. No one’s ever asked for them,” she said of her naturalization papers. “And it’s just
exasperating.”
Valdez, a retired nurse who voted for Kamala Harris last year, said she doesn’t have copies of her naturalization papers
and doesn’t have the money to replace them. She said she has rheumatoid arthritis, which limits her mobility and has
made it harder for her to get her papers, so she sought help from a Phoenix-based Latino rights group. But she has
gotten no response so far.

Sammy Westfall,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/25/2025,"As a diplomat, Pope Francis won breakthroughs and faced frustrations","Pope Francis, who died Monday at age 88, was not just a spiritual leader on the world stage but a practical diplomat.
The Vatican, tucked within Rome, is the world’s smallest country by population (882 at the end of last year) and area
(0.17 square miles). But the pope heads its governing structure, the Holy See, as an absolute monarch, on a diplomatic
footing with other world leaders.
As a diplomat, Francis pursued ambitious goals, meeting with some breakthroughs, while also running up against the
limits of his influence as conflicts mounted and environmental degradation intensified.
It’s difficult to measure a pope’s diplomatic power in absolute terms, said Timothy Byrnes, a political science professor
at Colgate University. But the pope has several vehicles for global influence: soft power and moral appeals, the
collective influence of the some 1.4 billion Catholics and the Holy See’s diplomatic apparatus.
The Holy See holds diplomatic relations with 183 countries. Its diplomatic missions are similar to conventional
embassies, led by “apostolic nuncios” who are ranked as ambassadors. The Holy See also participates in dozens of
intergovernmental organizations, bodies and programs, including as a member of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe and as a permanent observer to the United Nations.
Here are some of the diplomatic efforts Francis pursued in his 12 years as pope.
Obama’s opening to Cuba
In perhaps Francis’s best-known diplomatic project, the church secretly helped mediate a thaw in relations between the
United States and Cuba. After more than five decades of Cold War hostilities, the Obama administration and the
communist government of Cuba under Raúl Castro turned to the Holy See, trusted by both sides to mediate. What
followed was a period of behind-the-scenes, back-channel exchanges between Washington and Cuba via Vatican
intermediaries, including messages carried by Cardinal Jaime Ortega, archbishop of Havana, who became a secret
courier.
“Perhaps the most important part of my mission came when President Raúl Castro asked me to convey a message to
President Obama, by being the bearer of the Holy Father’s letter to the president in the White House,” Ortega said,
according to reporting by the Miami Herald. The White House kept Ortega’s name off visitor logs, and a talk at
Georgetown University served as a “cover story for his presence in Washington,” historians wrote. The Vatican also
hosted Cuban and U.S. delegations.
Announcing the breakthrough in Havana at a joint news conference with Castro in 2016, Obama thanked Francis and
Ortega, who he said “did so much to support the improved relations between our governments.” Under the thaw, the
two countries began to normalize relations.
The Holy See has “a new emphasis, which is to build bridges between persons, groups and nations,” Vatican Secretary
of State Pietro Parolin said at the time.
How history will see the thaw remains to be seen: In his first term, President Donald Trump observed many of the
changes, and although the Biden administration loosened restrictions further, relations remain strained, and all the
more so since Trump’s return to office.
The appointment of bishops in China
With China, Francis oversaw an agreement in 2018 — the details of which remain murky and have not been released —
over who has the right to nominate bishops there. The Holy See does not maintain direct relations with Beijing and is
one of about a dozen countries that officially recognize Taiwan.
The practical deal, which drew criticism for allowing China’s government to interfere in church affairs but also brought
millions of Catholics in China closer to the fold, gives the Vatican a role in the appointment of state-sanctioned Chinese
bishops. In an institution known for moral absolutes, it was an embrace of the gray.
“Pope Francis hopes that, with these decisions, a new process may begin that will allow the wounds of the past to be
overcome, leading to the full communion of all Chinese Catholics,” the Vatican said in a statement at the time.
Defending migrants
Francis’s first official trip outside Rome as pope in 2013 was to the small Italian island of Lampedusa, a key landing
point for migrants, to pray for refugees lost at sea. It was during that visit that he denounced the “globalization of
indifference” — the idea that in a globalized world, people have become “used to the suffering of others” and can no
longer “weep over the cruelty of our world, of our own hearts.”
The defense of migrants would become a central theme of his pontificate.
In 2016, he made headlines by washing the feet of asylum seekers in Italy. After a trip to a detention center in Greece in
2016, Pope Francis took a dozen Muslim refugees from Syria on the papal plane back to Vatican City — an example of
what Francis referred to as the responsibility of “welcoming the stranger.”
In a February letter to U.S. bishops, he addressed mass deportations in the U.S., denouncing “walls of ignominy” and
calling for his readers “not to give in to narratives that … cause unnecessary suffering to our migrant and refugee
brothers and sisters.”
While the full impact of Francis’s advocacy is difficult to measure, it put pressure on governments to accept migrants
amid a global migration crisis that has been met in some parts of the West with nationalist backlash.
Francis took on an “outward-looking role as a moral spokesman,” Byrnes said.
Climate change
Ahead of the signing of the landmark Paris agreement in 2015, Francis helped frame the climate crisis as a globally
historic moral and spiritual issue by publishing an encyclical devoted to the environment. He spoke of “climate change
as a moral scandal perpetrated upon the poor by the wealthy,” said Byrnes.
In 2022, the Holy See became a formal party to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, pledging to meet
the same emissions requirements as other parties. Under Francis, the Holy See moved from the sidelines to engage
directly as a full participant in key climate talks.
The papacy and the Vatican could be seen as “out of step with the modern world,” said Jodok Troy, an assistant
professor of political science at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. But from his unique position, the pope is able to
conceptualize politics from the perspective of “those who suffer from inequalities, those who suffer from climate
change, those who suffer from war.”
War and peace
Francis called repeatedly for peace between Russia and Ukraine, but stopped short of calling out Russia for its
invasion. In 2022, the pope warned the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church not to be “Putin’s altar boy.”
Francis sent prelate Matteo Zuppi to Kyiv, Moscow and Washington in an effort to broker a path to peace to no avail.
During the war in Gaza, Francis held a nightly video call with a parish in the Gaza Strip, even as his health waned. The
Holy See in 2015 recognized a state of Palestine under Francis. He condemned Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel,
and also Israel’s military response in Gaza.
His Easter remarks the day before he died included a final appeal for peace.",NA
Anthony Faiola,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/24/2025,"Pope Francis didn’t suffer in final moments before death, doctor says","VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis was alive but unresponsive after suffering a massive stroke early Monday, his doctor
said, and his medical team concluded there was no point in rushing him to the hospital, given the severity of his
condition and his standing orders to avoid extreme medical treatment.
“He died without suffering, at home,” Sergio Alfieri told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica in comments published
Thursday.
Alfieri, a surgeon at Rome’s Gemelli hospital, coordinated Francis’s treatment during his five-week hospitalization and
responded to his medical crisis on Monday.
The pope woke at 5 a.m. Monday for a glass of water, Alfieri said.
“He rolled over on his side and the nurse realized that something was wrong,” Alfieri told the Corriere della Sera
newspaper. “He was having trouble answering.”
At 5:30 a.m., the pope’s personal medical assistant called Alfieri to report a major health episode.
“’The Holy Father is very sick. We have to go back to Gemelli,” Massimiliano Strappetti said, according to Alfieri.
Fifteen minutes later, Alfieri arrived at Casa Santa Marta inside the Holy See. He entered the pope’s bedroom to find
his eyes wide open and the pontiff breathing normally, but unresponsive.
“I tried to call to him, but he didn’t answer me,” Alfieri told Corriere della Sera. “He didn’t respond to stimuli, not even
painful ones.” The pope was pinched to assess consciousness.
“At that moment I realized that there was nothing left to do. He was in a coma.”
Alfieri said hospitalizing him would have been “useless” because he probably would have died en route, and “Strappetti
knew the pope wanted to die at home.”
He died shortly after Alfieri’s examination, the doctor said.
“Doing a CT scan we would have had a more exact diagnosis, but nothing more,” he said. “It was one of those strokes
that, in an hour, carries you away.”
Alfieri had treated the pope before, including during abdominal surgery in 2021. Francis had issued an end-of-life
directive in which he said he would prefer to die than be intubated.
“He asked us to avoid overtreatment,” Alfieri told La Repubblica. “If he had lost consciousness, we would have had to
follow the directives of his personal health assistant, Massimiliano Strappetti, who was like a son to the Holy Father.”
Asked about Francis’s relationship with doctors, Alfieri said “he generally didn’t trust them much.”
Alfieri last saw the pope on Saturday, he said. Francis told him he felt “very well” and had “started working again.”
They agreed to meet again on Monday, Alfieri said, the day Francis died.
When the pope was released from the hospital on March 23, his doctors said publicly he should convalesce for two
months and avoid large crowds. But Alfieri said he did not advise him to stop working altogether, and he suggested
Francis had not been reckless with his health.
The pope consulted Strappetti before blessing an Easter Sunday crowd of 35,000 people and making what turned out
to be his final round of St. Peter’s Square in his popemobile.
“It’s as if approaching in the end he decided to do everything he had to,” Alfieri said. The pope said, “I am very well, I
have started working again, and I like it.”
Francis had one final regret, Alfieri told La Repubblica. He visited with prisoners on Holy Thursday, a papal tradition
in emulation of the humility of Jesus — but he was not strong enough to wash their feet.",NA
Brian Murphy,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/25/2025,"Virginia Giuffre, accuser in Prince Andrew teen sex scandal, dies at 41","Virginia Giuffre, who roiled the British monarchy with detailed allegations of being coerced as a teenager into sex with
Prince Andrew as part of a suspected sex-trafficking network led by financier Jeffrey Epstein, died April 25 at her home
in Western Australia. She was 41.
A statement by her publicist, Dini von Mueffling, said Ms. Giuffre died by suicide.
A message posted on Ms. Giuffre’s social media account on April 1 said she was being treated for renal failure after a
car accident near Perth in Western Australia. Police described the apparent incident as a “minor” crash between a bus
and a car and had no reports of serious injuries.
After spending much of her life in South Florida — where she met Epstein — Ms. Giuffre had lived on and off in
Australia since her marriage to an Australian martial arts instructor in 2002.
Amid the public unraveling of Epstein’s matrix of sex, money and power — allegedly involving scores of young women
who claimed they were lured into its orbit — Ms. Giuffre (pronounced JOO-fray) emerged as one of the most
prominent accusers in a saga capped by Epstein’s death in 2019 in his Manhattan jail cell. The 66-year-old Epstein,
investigators said, hanged himself with a bedsheet.
In court papers, lawsuits and interviews spanning nearly a decade, Ms. Giuffre recounted how she — then named
Virginia Roberts — first came under Epstein’s grip as a 16-year-old and described her travel on private jets to
hideaways and parties to be “passed around like a platter of fruit” to his influential friends.
Among them, she said, was Andrew, the younger brother of then-Prince Charles (now King Charles III) and once
second in line to the throne. Ms. Giuffre’s allegations of being forced repeatedly into sex with Andrew touched off a
media firestorm and legal battles for Andrew, who did not face criminal proceedings but was eventually stripped by the
monarchy of his formal duties and titles including “his royal highness.”
A civil lawsuit filed by Ms. Giuffre against Andrew ended in 2022 with a reported $16 million settlement by the prince,
who borrowed some of the payout money from his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. (Andrew denied that he engaged in sex
with Ms. Giuffre but acknowledged that she suffered as “an established victim of abuse.”)
Ms. Giuffre also helped shed light on the predatory role of Epstein’s girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was later
described by prosecutors as always on the lookout for girls she could cajole into meeting privately with Epstein.
The girls were then often ensnared into his sex-for-favors web at locales such as his Manhattan townhouse and his
private islet, Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Maxwell, the daughter of media tycoon Robert Maxwell, was
sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking.
A photo taken in 2001 in Maxwell’s London home appears to show Andrew with his arm around the bare midriff of 17-
year-old Ms. Giuffre. Maxwell is in the background, smiling.
“My whole life revolved around just pleasing these men and keeping Ghislaine and Jeffrey happy,” Ms. Giuffre said in a
deposition as part of a 2016 defamation suit against Maxwell. “Their whole entire lives revolved around sex.” (The
defamation case was settled out of court by Maxwell in 2017 for an undisclosed sum; the deposition records were made
public in 2019 just days before Epstein’s death, which was ruled a suicide.)
Epstein’s death closed the prosecution into his alleged crimes but did not cool speculation about his wider associations.
In February, Attorney General Pam Bondi released what she called the “first phase” of Justice Department files on the
case. Some information was omitted to protect the more than 250 women and girls allegedly victimized by Epstein and
Maxwell.
The newly released documents did not bring any significant new revelations into Epstein’s contacts. Many of the names
were previously noted in court documents, police reports or other disclosures. (In court records, Ms. Giuffre alleged
links by some politicians and other well-known figures to Epstein’s sex trafficking, but no charges have been filed.)
Former president Bill Clinton acknowledged taking trips on Epstein’s private jet in connection with work for the
Clinton Foundation but insisted that he knew nothing about the financier’s “terrible crimes.” President Donald Trump
also had known Epstein for decades.
“Terrific guy,” Trump said of Epstein in 2002. “… He’s a lot of fun to be with.” After Epstein’s 2019 arrest, a lawyer for
the Trump Organization said in a statement that the two men had “no relationship.”
Ms. Giuffre said her first contact with Maxwell came in 2000 at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida,
where Ms. Giuffre’s father worked on the maintenance crew. She had landed a summer job as a 16-year-old spa
attendant when Ms. Giuffre, by her account, was offered a job working for Epstein as a traveling masseuse.
“I ran over to my dad who works on the tennis courts at Mar-a-Lago, and he knows I’m trying to fix my life up at that
point, which is why he got me the job there. I said: ‘You’re not going to believe it dad,’” Ms. Giuffre told the BBC public
affairs program “Panorama” in 2019.
She said the grooming as a “teen sex slave” began almost immediately. Maxwell, she said, took her to Epstein’s Palm
Beach home to massage him while he was naked and “instructed” her to perform oral sex on him.
Ms. Giuffre shared details with them about her turbulent childhood: molested by a family friend at age 11 and then
living in foster homes and finally on the streets of South Florida as a 14-year-old runaway, she told the Miami Herald.
At one point, she ended up under the hold of a Miami pimp, Ron Eppinger, who kept her confined to an apartment that
was part of an underground brothel network. After Eppinger was arrested in 2000, Ms. Giuffre reunited with her father
in West Palm Beach, she said. Eppinger pleaded guilty in 2001 in U.S. District Court in Miami to charges including
involvement in trafficking for prostitution.
Ms. Giuffre later realized that it was a mistake to reveal her past to Epstein and Maxwell. “They knew how vulnerable I
was,” Ms. Giuffre told the BBC. She claimed that Maxwell then used her to help find other girls for Epstein.
“His appetite was insatiable,” Ms. Giuffre said. “He wanted new girls, fresh, young faces every single day — that was
just the sickness that he had.”
Andrew’s gambit
In the 2021 civil suit in federal court in Manhattan, Ms. Giuffre alleged that Maxwell and Epstein introduced her to
Andrew when she was 17. She claimed that she was forced into sex with the prince on three occasions — the first time
in March 2001 after she was taken by Maxwell to a London nightclub, Tramp, where she danced with Andrew and then
went to Maxwell’s apartment.
Three months after Epstein’s death, Andrew arranged a one-on-one interview with the BBC’s Emily Maitlis at
Buckingham Palace. He hoped the openness would help him salvage his reputation, but Andrew was widely seen as
arrogant and tone deaf to the severity of his association with Epstein. “Nuclear explosion level bad,” wrote Charlie
Proctor, editor of the Royal Central website.
“Do I regret the fact that he [Epstein] has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes,” Andrew
said.
“Unbecoming?” Maitlis responded. “He was a sex offender.”
Andrew: “Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m being polite.”
Andrew told Maitlis that he went to New York in December 2010 to end his friendship with Epstein, who had just
finished a 13-month jail sentence in Florida for soliciting prostitution. (Under a plea deal, Epstein was allowed to leave
custody for up to 12 hours a day to continue working as a money manager and adviser.) Andrew, who spent four days
as Epstein’s houseguest, said he felt breaking off ties by phone was the “chicken’s way of doing it.”
To the BBC, Andrew added that he had “no recollection” of meeting Ms. Giuffre and “categorically” denied engaging in
sex with her. When asked about the photo of them together, he questioned its authenticity by saying “public displays of
affection are not something that I do.”
In one of the interview’s many unexpected twists, he took issue with Ms. Giuffre’s claims that he sweated profusely
during one of their encounters. He claimed to have a “peculiar medical condition” related to adrenaline overload
during the 1982 Falklands War that left him unable to perspire.
Ms. Giuffre’s lawyers responded by demanding medical proof and seeking witnesses from the London club about
Andrew’s state of sweat. The out-of-court settlement was later hammered out.
Thailand escape
Virginia Louise Roberts was born in Sacramento on Aug. 9, 1983, and grew up in Loxahatchee, Florida. She was taken
into foster care after child welfare authorities suspected she was abused by a person she described as a family friend.
Her break from Maxwell and Epstein came in September 2002, when she was 19, during a trip to Thailand to attend
massage training. The real purpose of the journey, she claimed, was to return to the United States with a Thai girl
recruited by Maxwell for the Epstein ring.
At the massage classes, she met martial artist Robert Giuffre, and they were soon married. Ms. Giuffre said she severed
ties with Maxwell and Epstein and moved to Australia with her new husband.
By late 2005, investigations into Epstein were taking shape. Police in Palm Beach opened an investigation after
allegations by a 14-year-old Florida girl that she was molested after being asked to give him a massage in exchange for
money.
Epstein’s legal team, which included Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, managed to strike various
settlements and deals, including the daily work-release during the 13-month jail sentence that was harshly criticized by
victim rights groups and others for its leniency.
Ms. Giuffre dropped a defamation lawsuit against Dershowitz in 2022, saying she could no longer be sure of the
identity of the man she once believed to be Dershowitz. “I have long believed that I was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein to
Alan Dershowitz. … I now recognize I may have made a mistake in identifying Mr. Dershowitz,” she said in a statement
shared by her lawyers. Dershowitz, in turn, agreed to drop his defamation countersuit against Ms. Giuffre.
In 2009, civil suits by Ms. Giuffre and other alleged victims of Epstein — all listed anonymously as Jane Does — were
settled for amounts undisclosed at the time. (Documents unsealed in 2022 showed Ms. Giuffre received $500,000).
Ms. Giuffre said she decided to go public with her allegations following the birth of her daughter in January 2010; she
earlier had two sons.
“I just couldn’t imagine bringing her into a world where I know what happened to me, and I know what I went
through,” she said. “That was when I said, ‘We’ve got to do something. We’ve got to hold these people accountable.’”
In 2015, Ms. Giuffre created the nonprofit group Victims Refuse Silence, which was relaunched under the name Speak
Out, Act, Reclaim, or SOAR, in 2021. She appeared in the 2020 Netflix documentary miniseries “Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy
Rich.”
Ms. Giuffre and her family lived in Australia from 2002 until 2013 and then spent several years in the United States.
Australian media reported that the family moved to Perth in 2020 and that the couple later separated. Complete
information on survivors was not immediately available.
“I wasn’t chained to a sink,” she told the BBC of her years with Epstein and Maxwell, “but these powerful people were
my chain.”

Justin Jouvenal;Laura Meckler,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/28/2025,How religious public schools went from a long shot to the Supreme Court,"The proposal was the most audacious Robert Franklin had seen during his four decades in education: The Catholic
Archdiocese of Oklahoma City wanted to create the nation’s first religious, taxpayer-funded public charter school.
Franklin, who chaired a state board responsible for approving new charter schools, saw the idea as patently illegal and
an obvious assault on the separation of church and state. Oklahoma would be directly sponsoring — and paying for — a
school that promises to inject religion into every aspect of its teaching and expect students “to adhere” to its beliefs.
He was sure the idea would quickly die.
But this was a proposal aimed well beyond one tiny charter school for rural Oklahoma. It was part of a careful legal and
political strategy aimed at affecting public and parochial education coast to coast.
During a break in a meeting of the charter school board where the proposal was discussed, Franklin approached a
church official who had helped craft the idea.
“I feel like this is so much bigger than what this board is all about,” Franklin told him. “Perhaps I’m just a pawn in this
process.”
“You are,” the official replied, according to Franklin. “We’re going forward. We will go to the Supreme Court if we have
to.”
Two years later, his prediction has come to pass. The nation’s highest court will hear oral arguments Wednesday over
the constitutionality of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School — a blockbuster case that could remake bedrock
constitutional principles.
The case was born in Oklahoma but propelled forward by a religious liberty clinic at the University of Notre Dame in
Indiana. The clinic is one of the most connected legal institutions in the country, with extensive financial and personal
ties to members of the Supreme Court and a mission to break down barriers between church and state.
A Notre Dame law professor had put forward the idea that denying government funding for parochial charter schools
would amount to anti-religious discrimination. She based her position on recent decisions by Chief Justice John G.
Roberts Jr. and the rest of the court’s conservative majority that boosted the role of religion in public life.
A high court victory for St. Isidore, based on the law professor’s premise, would represent a major expansion of the use
of taxpayer money for religious education — and the clinic’s biggest win to date.
While school vouchers in some states help pay for private religious schools, charter schools are full-fledged public
schools. They get the same funding as traditional public schools and must abide by the same nondiscrimination rules.
St. Isidore’s would not only teach religion, but it would also make faith-based hiring and curriculum decisions that
have been strictly off-limits for public institutions.
Justin Driver, a professor at Yale Law School and an expert on education law, said it is “difficult to overstate the
magnitude of the case for our constitutional order.”
“The goal posts in this constitutional area have moved incredibly far, incredibly fast,” Driver said. “Even a decade ago,
the notion that states would be required to recognize religious charter schools was not at all a mainstream view. …
There is a certain sense of constitutional whiplash here.”
Creating the blueprint
A year before the St. Isidore proposal came before Franklin’s board, Notre Dame law professor Nicole Garnett laid out
a blueprint for making it a reality.
Garnett, a former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas, had worked on school choice issues since the 1990s and was a
prominent voice in the conservative legal movement. In a 2020 paper, she argued that the high court had cracked the
door to radically remaking American education by ruling in a Montana case that states may not exclude religious
schools when offering subsidies or funding for private education. Garnett made a provocative argument: The court’s
reasoning would ultimately require states to allow public charter schools that are religious in nature.
“If religious charter schools are constitutionally permissible, then justice — as well as the Constitution — demands that
they must be permitted,” Garnett wrote.
That idea was a legal outlier. The 45 states that allow charter schools, plus the District of Columbia, all require them to
be nonsectarian. Decisions by the Supreme Court since the 1960s had erected a high wall between religion and schools.
Garnett herself had doubted the constitutionality of direct public funding for religious charter schools as recently as
2014, writing that “all state laws make clear that charter schools are privately operated public schools,” so a religious
public charter school could not receive government money without changes to statutes.
But in education and other spheres, the Roberts court has bolstered religious liberty in rulings that have become one of
its most significant legacies.
First, in 2017, the court found that Missouri could not exclude a religious preschool from a playground resurfacing
program. Then came the 2020 Montana case requiring states that aid private schools to include some faith-based ones
in that funding. In 2022, the court would require Maine to let parents use vouchers for religious schools, and it would
let a high school football coach pray on the school field.
In a separate case this term, the court appears likely to side with a group of parents who want to pull their children
from public school lessons with LGBTQ+-themed books for religious reasons.
Each of the recent rulings relied on an expansive view of the First Amendment’s free exercise clause, which prohibits
the government from interfering with the right of individuals to practice religion. Critics argue the rulings have
dangerously diminished the First Amendment’s counterpoint: the establishment clause, which prohibits the
government from establishing an official religion or favoring certain faiths.
Garnett’s paper said an organization seeking to open a religious charter school might challenge state rules on the same
free exercise grounds that had been so successful in the earlier cases. In contrast to her 2014 position, Garnett asserted
religious public charter schools should be considered private entities so they could receive public money.
“It is likely that lawsuits challenging charter school laws will be filed in some states in the near future,” she wrote.
Officials with the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City also had been following the high court’s jurisprudence. Its general
counsel knew Garnett and her scholarship. Catholic school officials had concluded during the pandemic that online
learning could be successful for some children.
The combination sparked the idea of creating an online-only religious public charter school to reach rural Catholics
who did not have access to brick-and-mortar parochial schools, as well as students with special needs. In 2021, the
archdiocese asked Garnett for help.
Garnett said the case would be a good fit for the newly created Religious Liberty Clinic at Notre Dame’s law school,
established the previous year.
Tracking major Supreme Court decisions
Here are the biggest cases before the Supreme Court this term. See which
have been argued, which decided and why it matters.
(Miriam Martincic/For The Washington
Post)
The clinic and archdiocese tested the waters for St. Isidore in a seven-page letter to Franklin, the charter school board
chairman. He was surprised to see it included 32 footnotes, citations to recent Supreme Court rulings and legal
arguments about the First Amendment that Garnett had made in her earlier paper.
“Typically, you get a proposal from a vendor that is a page, a page-and-a-half, that says: ‘This is who we are. This is
what we want to do. This is why we would like to run a charter school,’ ” he said.
It won’t pass legal muster, Franklin told the Catholic officials.
They asked him to request a legal opinion from Oklahoma Attorney General John M. O’Connor.
Franklin agreed, confident that the attorney general would share his constitutional concerns.
He was wrong.
A battle among conservatives
In December 2022, weeks before leaving office, O’Connor backed St. Isidore’s, arguing in an opinion that Oklahoma’s
law requiring charter schools be nonsectarian was likely to be unconstitutional based on the recent Supreme Court
cases.
Franklin and Garnett said they were both surprised, but they weren’t the only ones.
Republican Gentner Drummond had defeated O’Connor in the GOP primary for attorney general in 2022 and was
preparing to take office when O’Connor’s opinion was issued.
Both men are religious Christians. But Drummond argued that there was an important difference between the
government allowing vouchers to fund religious schools and the state creating a religious school.
He feared the latter could open the door to the government imposing rules on parochial schools that run counter to
their beliefs and clear the way for schools run by radical Islamists or the Church of Satan. And he thought Oklahoma
was being used by outside interests to push an agenda that ran counter to state law as well as the state and U.S.
constitutions.
“We’re the perfect target. We’re a small state by population. We’re a very bright red state,” he said in an interview.
“They had the perfect trilogy of the governor, the schools superintendent and attorney general.”
In February 2023, Drummond replaced O’Connor’s opinion with his own analysis that the school’s application was
unconstitutional.
Shortly before he sent out his letter, he spoke with Garnett, at the archdiocese’s request. He recalled her being
“flummoxed” that he would take this step, telling him his legal position was in “direct violation” of the three cases in
which the Supreme Court had steadily opened more and more public funding for religious schools in recent years.
“Her plea was: ‘Please readdress this. … This is the state of Oklahoma discriminating against St. Isidore’s,'” Drummond
recalled. “I said, ‘Respectfully, it is not that.’” They spoke for about 30 minutes, he said, each failing to convince the
other.
But the Catholic church and the legal clinic had other powerful backers in the state, which has become one of the
nation’s foremost laboratories for pushing the boundaries of religion in public schools. In deciding to represent St.
Isidore’s, Notre Dame had considered the state’s politics and what sort of opposition they might run into, according to
a person familiar with the church’s thinking on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were
not authorized to discuss the case.
Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt supports the creation of the school, as does Ryan Walters, the state schools
superintendent, who has drawn national attention for trying to put Bibles in classrooms and incorporate the Ten
Commandments into school curriculums, among other proposals.
In June 2023, two days before the virtual charter school board was set to vote on St. Isidore’s application, Oklahoma’s
Republican House speaker replaced a charter school board member expected to vote against the proposal to create St.
Isidore with an Oklahoma City businessman, Brian Bobek.
Franklin, the board chair, publicly called for Bobek to recuse from the high-profile decision, arguing that his last-
minute appointment created the appearance of political manipulation and that Bobek had not been on the board long
enough to hear all the arguments about the proposed school. Bobek declined and cast the deciding vote in a 3-2
decision ratifying the school, with Franklin in the minority.
The following month the ACLU, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and others sued on behalf of a
group of Oklahoma residents, asking for St. Isidore’s approval to be rescinded. They argued that their tax dollars
should not go to a school that might discriminate against gay students and those of other faiths. In its application, the
school had said all students were welcome but that they were expected to adhere to the school’s “beliefs” and religious
mission.
“Public schools would become Sunday schools,” said Rachel Laser, chief executive of Americans United for the
Separation of Church and State. “The religious freedom of religious minorities and the nonreligious would be
imperiled.”
St. Isidore’s backers had expected liberal groups would object to religious charter schools. But what happened next
came as a surprise.
Drummond filed his own suit against the virtual charter school board, arguing the contract it signed with St. Isidore
violated the state’s constitution. That is the case being argued Wednesday.
“That obviously changed everything,” said the person familiar with church thinking. “Everyone expects a left-right
fight. Suddenly it’s a right-right fight.”
The Oklahoma Supreme Court sided with Drummond, ruling the virtual charter school board must rescind the St.
Isidore’s contract because the school violated the First Amendment’s establishment clause, Oklahoma law and the
state’s constitution.
“Are we being used as a test case? It sure looks like it,” Oklahoma Justice Yvonne Kauger said during oral arguments.
She suggested that a dismantling of the wall between church and state would have far-reaching consequences. “When
the wall comes down, it’s ‘Katy, bar the door.’ Everyone would be affected.”
A potential landmark ruling
That high stakes proposition now goes before the Supreme Court.
People on both sides of the case say the key question will be whether charter schools are fundamentally private
operators or part of the public school system. If private, religious practice will probably be viewed as constitutional; if
public, it would be banned.
“The state has enlisted private entities to run schools and given public funds to them,” Garnett said in an interview,
referring to the private organizations that run most charter schools. “And it has said the only kind of pluralism that is
off the table is religious pluralism.”
Opponents will argue the opposite.
“Our founders believed that when the state acts and starts picking winners and losers in a religious area, our religious
liberties are compromised,” said Drummond, who will be in the second chair for Oklahoma on Wednesday. “For us to
have the liberty to freely exercise religion or not, we must maintain a separation between state action and religion. To
go down this road jeopardizes religious liberty.”
Seven of the nine justices were raised Catholic, and six attended Catholic high schools. The court’s ties to Notre Dame
and Garnett’s law clinic are substantial, prompting court watchdogs to call for some of the justices not to hear the case.
In 2021, Notre Dame paid Justice Clarence Thomas almost $20,000 to give a speech. In 2022, an affiliate of the clinic
flew Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. to Rome for a four-day trip to give a speech. In 2022 and 2023, Notre Dame’s Law
School paid Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to speak and teach in Rome and London.
The court’s ethics code allows justices to accept these opportunities from universities, which are seen as helping spread
knowledge about the law and the court. Many other prestigious schools have similarly paid the justices for educational
engagements on campus and abroad, although by one measure Notre Dame has spent the most.
The only justice planning to sit out the case is Amy Coney Barrett, a former Notre Dame law professor who is close
friends with Garnett. In 2020, as Barrett was leaving her job at the university to join the high court, a staffer from the
religious liberties clinic purchased Barrett’s Indiana home.
Barrett’s recusal means only eight justices will vote on the legality of St. Isidore’s. The three liberals are widely expected
to see the school as unconstitutional. A 4-4 tie would keep the state Supreme Court’s rejection of the school in place.
Church officials say they are excited about opening their new virtual school in fall 2026. That has always been their
goal, they say.
But for opponents like Robert Franklin, it was clear from the start that far more is at stake.
“This was never really about two or three hundred children in the state of Oklahoma, in a far-flung rural setting, who
wanted a virtual Catholic education,” he said. “This is a test case from the beginning.”",NA
Chico Harlan,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/25/2025,How Rome and the Vatican are preparing for Pope Francis’s funeral,"On the eve of a papal funeral, Rome prepares
Francis’s funeral is likely to be the largest single-day event at the Vatican in 20 years.
Updated VATICAN CITY — As pilgrims and world leaders alike prepare to say goodbye to Pope Francis at his funeral Saturday,
Rome is racing to get ready.
The city is blocking off roads and calling in police officers from across the country. It is installing screens for overflow
crowds. It is working to slot in an influx of private and government jets escorting kings and queens, prime ministers,
and presidents, including Donald Trump. The funeral will have the security concerns of a United Nations assembly and
the crowd scale of a massive music festival — and it is taking place with less than a week’s notice, following Francis’s
death on Monday at age 88.
“It is an activity, as you have seen in recent days, that is particularly complex,” said Fabio Ciciliano, the head of Italy’s
civil protection service.
Francis’s funeral is likely to be the largest single-day event at the Vatican in 20 years, since the funeral of Pope John
Paul II. Italian media outlets have said authorities are expecting at least 200,000 people — a crowd that would spill out
of the colonnaded piazza of the tiny city-state and flow into the streets of Rome.
After the funeral, which starts at 10 a.m. local time and is expected to last 90 minutes, Francis’s coffin will be
transferred through the city to the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major, where the pope asked to be buried.
He will be the first pope in more than a century to be buried outside the Vatican’s ancient walls. And the resulting
procession — about four miles — will add an extra element of complexity to the day while allowing crowds in central
Rome to also say goodbye.
Francis’s funeral might not quite match the size of John Paul II’s, which attracted at least 300,000 people and marked
a global outpouring for a towering Cold War-era figure. The Vatican said that funeral involved 159 foreign delegations,
not to mention 11,900 police officers and security officials and 6,000 journalists. Authorities set up 3,600 portable
toilets and distributed 3 million free bottles of water.
Francis’s funeral will have a banner list of attendees — with much intrigue about how world leaders will interact at a
time of high geopolitical tensions. Trump said he will be there with first lady Melania Trump. Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelensky, who had a contentious White House meeting with Trump in February, will also attend. Others on
the expected guest list: French President Emmanuel Macron; U.N. Secretary General António Guterres; Prince
William, the Prince of Wales; and Javier Milei, the president of Francis’s native Argentina.
Former president Joe Biden and former first lady Jill Biden will also attend, according to a Biden spokesperson. The
Vatican said Milei and Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, will have front-row seats. Other seats will be filled with the
reigning sovereigns, followed by the heads of state and government — in alphabetical order, according to the country
name in French.
Fifty heads of state, 10 reigning sovereigns and 130 delegations are confirmed to attend the funeral, according to the
Office of Protocol of the Vatican Secretariat of State.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met several times with Francis during the pope’s 12-year pontificate, will not be
attending. Putin is subject to an International Criminal Court arrest warrant over alleged war crimes in Ukraine.
(Zimbabwe’s then-president Robert Mugabe attended John Paul II’s funeral despite a European Union travel ban. Italy
allowed him to land because he was going to the Vatican, which is not part of the E.U.)
Two years ago, the Catholic Church held a funeral for Benedict XVI. But the circumstances of that event were unusual:
Benedict had abdicated in 2013 and had spent nearly a decade as a mostly secluded pope emeritus. Only 50,000 people
attended his funeral on a foggy January morning.
This time, the spring weather figures to be ideal — with a Saturday high of 72 degrees. The city was already buzzing
with religious pilgrims because of the once-every-25-years jubilee. Rome had been expecting huge crowds this year and
had conducted major public works upgrades.
Fortuitously, one of those projects involved reducing car traffic just outside the Vatican — allowing a free flow of
pedestrians from the fortress of Castel Sant’Angelo to St. Peter’s Square.",NA
Adam Taylor,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/30/2025,Rwanda responds warmly to Trump request to take noncitizen deportees,"The Trump administration’s efforts to significantly broaden the number of countries willing to accept people deported
from the United States has found a welcoming partner in the African nation of Rwanda.
A recent U.S. overture, which included a list of names of potential deportees to Rwanda, was received warmly,
according to a Rwandan official with knowledge of the situation. Under the proposal, Rwanda would join a growing
number of nations — including El Salvador, Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama — that have agreed to receive deportees
who are not their citizens.
Though the administration has deported only one person — an Iraqi refugee accused of having links to terrorism
groups — from the United States to Rwanda so far, “we’re open to others,” said the Rwandan official, speaking, like
some others, on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions or because they are not authorized to talk
with the news media.
The deportation discussions have coincided with U.S. efforts to broker a peace agreement between Rwanda and the
neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo. They have been in conflict since early 2022 in their most recent round of
fighting.
Rwanda has for years promoted itself as a destination for deportations of people who are not its citizens, which critics
say is an attempt to downplay its reputation for human rights abuses under its longtime president, Paul Kagame.
Britain and Denmark also have explored policies for sending large numbers of asylum seekers to Rwanda, but those
efforts were halted after they sparked public outcry and legal challenges.
The State Department, under the Biden administration, said last year that there were reports of “significant human
rights issues” in Rwanda, including extrajudicial killings and arbitrary detention. The Trump administration has
deported people to other nations with poor human rights records, including El Salvador, where migrants have been
housed in a notorious megaprison.
A U.S. official who worked on issues related to Rwanda during the Biden administration said it appears officials there
are working to reset the country’s relationship with the United States after the new administration in February
imposed sanctions on a Rwandan minister for allegedly supporting an armed group in eastern Congo.
“The cozier that Rwanda gets to the Trump administration, the less likely they are going to press them to make
concessions” in any U.S.-brokered peace talks with Congo, the U.S. official said.
The talks between the United States and Rwanda began not long after Trump took office, the Rwandan official said.
“They asked us if we were open to discussing it and we said yes,” the Rwandan official said, adding that “our
government, our institutions, have a lot of experience” in this area.
The State Department declined to address questions about future deportations to Rwanda, but in a statement to The
Washington Post it tacitly acknowledged the ongoing discussions. “In some cases, we might work with other countries
to facilitate the removal from the United States of nationals of third countries who have no legal basis to remain here,”
it said, noting, too, that if Rwanda and Congo were to reach peace, it could “unlock further bilateral cooperation.”
During a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio added that the Trump administration was
“actively searching” for nations willing to take citizens from third countries.
“We are working with other countries to say, ‘We want to send you some of the most despicable human beings,’” he
said, adding that it would be a “favor to us” and that the “further away from America, the better.”
The administration has cast a wide net in searching for countries that could host third-party deportees, even
considering troubled nations such as Libya — which the State Department advises against all travel to because of crime,
terrorism and other dangers.
One third-party national, Iraqi citizen Omar Abdulsattar Ameen, was sent to Rwanda this month. Ameen was granted
refugee status in the United States in 2014, but he had been the center of a legal battle under both the first Trump
administration and the Biden administration, which accused him of having links to the Islamic State.
The Trump administration, apparently heeding a judge’s order, asked that Ameen not be sent to his home country of
Iraq because of safety concerns, the Rwandan official said, adding that he is allowed to leave the country if he chooses.
The deportation appears to mark the conclusion of Ameen’s lengthy legal battle. He was arrested in 2018 and accused
of being part of an Islamic State murder plot in Iraq. Trump administration officials highlighted the case to criticize the
vetting process for resettled refugees.
Critics said the evidence against him was weak, and in 2021, a federal judge determined that the allegations against
him were “simply not plausible” and ordered his release. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents began
new deportation proceedings soon after. A judge found that Ameen was eligible to be deported because he lied on
immigration papers but barred the United States from sending him to Iraq where, the judge said, he could be tortured.
Ameen’s presence in Rwanda was first reported by independent journalist Marisa Kabas, who cited a State Department
cable that described it as a new “removal” program for third-party nationals. The Post has not independently
confirmed the contents of that cable.
During the first Trump administration, the United States sent Adham Amin Hassoun, a stateless man born in Lebanon
to Palestinian refugees, to Rwanda. The United States had sought to deport Hassoun, who had moved to the U.S. in the
1980s, after he had served a sentence on a terrorism-related charge.
Jeffrey Smith, executive director of the pro-democracy nonprofit Vanguard Africa, said any plan to deport immigrants
to Rwanda would be both “morally and legally reprehensible.”
“This is merely a ploy to garner positive headlines and a cynical way in which to compel Western governments, like the
U.S., to look the other way when inevitable human rights abuses are committed,” Smith said.
Ongoing peace talks between Rwanda and Congo are being spearheaded by a new U.S. envoy for Africa: Massad
Boulos, father-in-law of Tiffany Trump, the president’s daughter. In a notable shift from prior peace talks, they have
focused on the economic opportunities presented by large amounts of rare earth and other critical minerals in Congo’s
politically unstable eastern region.
Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe visited Washington last week, where he met with Rubio and
Congolese Foreign Minister Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner. They set a goal of reaching a peace agreement by Friday.
Rubio praised Boulos’s efforts as he spoke at Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting, saying he had defied the expectations of
people who said it could “never be done.”",NA
Amanda Coletta,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/27/2025,Mark Carney favored to win Canada’s federal election upended by Trump,"TORONTO — Britain had just voted to exit the European Union, and economic and political uncertainty was radiating
across the globe. The British prime minister had resigned. The pound was tumbling to a 31-year low, and global
equities markets were shedding $2.1 trillion.
With a leadership vacuum consuming the British establishment and the financial shock rocking the world, in stepped a
Canadian.
“We are well-prepared for this,” Mark Carney, the first foreign-born governor of the Bank of England, assured an
anxious global audience. In a four-minute speech, he laid out the “extensive contingency plans” the central bank had
spent months putting in place and vowed to take additional measures if needed.
In a “chaos-filled week,” the Irish Independent reported at the time, the “calmly delivered speech … suggested that at
least one person, or institution, had a plan for tackling the Brexit fallout.” The article was headlined “Mark Carney —
cometh the hour, cometh the man.”
Now Carney, running in his first federal election Monday after less than two months as Canada’s prime minister, is
campaigning on a pitch that his experience steering nations through economic tumult makes him the battle-tested man
for this unprecedented moment in the country’s history.
President Donald Trump’s trade war, his threats to use “economic force” to make Canada the 51st state and the U.S.
turn toward a kind of protectionism not seen in more than a century have thrust the country into a generational crisis
— and compelled the Canadian economist into politics.
“No crisis, no Mark Carney in this election,” he told reporters this month.
So far, the pitch is working — and Carney’s Liberals are on the cusp of a remarkable comeback.
After nearly a decade in power, the party was down by double digits to Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives and careering
toward a historic wipeout when Justin Trudeau stepped down as prime minister in January.
But Trudeau’s resignation, the elevation of Carney as his replacement and Trump’s threats have set off an earthquake
in Canada’s politics. In mere months, the Conservatives’ 20-plus-point lead has vanished. Although polls are
tightening, the Liberals now are favored to win the election, polls show — and maybe even a parliamentary majority,
for the first time since 2015.
“Mark Carney came along at really the right time,” said pollster David Coletto, chair of Abacus Data. “It absolutely feels
like he was made for this.”
‘Plan beats no plan’
Carney was born in Fort Smith, a town in the Northwest Territories, and moved to Edmonton, Alberta, as a child. He
studied and played ice hockey at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and earned a PhD in economics at
England’s Oxford, where he met his wife, Diana Fox Carney. They have four children.
He spent more than a decade with the financial giant Goldman Sachs before a want ad in the Economist caught his eye.
The Bank of Canada, the country’s central bank, was looking for a deputy governor. He applied and got the job.
In 2007, as the conditions that would cause the global financial crisis were gathering, the Conservative Prime Minister
Stephen Harper appointed Carney governor — a post analogous to chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Canada fared
better during the global meltdown than its Group of Seven peers, and Carney was feted with global praise.
When he was named chair of a global financial regulatory body in 2011, Maclean’s magazine called him “the Canadian
hired to save the world.”
Not everyone was thrilled with his management. When Carney backed stricter rules to prevent a future catastrophe,
Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, rebuked Carney in a meeting, charging that the proposed
changes were “anti-American.”
“If some institutions feel pressure today,” Carney said in a speech days later, without naming names, “it’s because they
have done too little for too long.”
How key a role Carney played during the crisis has been a topic of debate during the campaign. Harper accused Carney
of taking credit for “things he had little or nothing to do with” and endorsed Poilievre. Carney has said Harper offered
him the job of finance minister; Harper has not denied it.
In 2012, the Conservative British government of Prime Minister David Cameron poached Carney to head the Bank of
England — the first foreigner in the role in the institution’s 300-plus-year history. Harper praised Carney for having
done a “tremendous job.”
Carney arrived in Britain with a level of public recognition that would be unusual for most Canadian prime ministers,
let alone its central bankers. He was a fixture of the British press, which called him “part Hollywood star and part
financial markets geek.”
He drew some criticism. After he was seen as giving mixed messages on interest rates, a Labour lawmaker called the
Bank of England an “unreliable boyfriend.” Brexiteers were incensed when, months before the 2016 referendum, he
identified leaving the E.U. as the “biggest domestic risk to financial stability.”
“He had the good sense and courage to say what was perfectly obvious: that Brexit would be damaging to the British
economy, and so it has proved,” said Richard Portes, an economics professor at London Business School. “On the
whole, his tenure was very successful.”
In his 2021 book “Value(s): Building a Better World for All,” Carney wrote that when financial markets reflected a
belief that voters would choose to stay in the E.U., the Bank of England prepared for the opposite, creating a playbook
of hundreds of pages on how to mitigate the risks of different scenarios.
“Plan beats no plan,” he wrote.
Is Canada looking for a man in finance?
Questions about whether Carney, 60, might enter politics have long swirled. In 2012, amid one such period of
speculation, he said, “Why don’t I become a circus clown?”
But he made the leap this year. For the political novice, the campaign has been a baptism by fire.
Poilievre is a populist, lifelong politician with a gift for rousing a crowd and delivering a pithy jab. Carney is more
measured. He answers questions by noting how many points he intends to make, and then ticks through them, one by
one.
Amid Trump’s chaos and uncertainty, “his blandness is a virtue,” said Coletto, the pollster.
“He’s still very much a policy guy, and that shows a lot in his campaigning,” said Lori Williams, a political scientist at
Mount Royal University in Alberta. “But he’s also an incredibly quick study.”
At one rally, a woman yelled, “Lead us, Big Daddy!” He laughed and noted her “passion.” When protesters claimed he
was “controlled” by the World Economic Forum, he put his fingers to an imaginary earpiece and quipped that he was
“listening to the orders coming through.”
Carney has cast himself as an outsider and safe pair of hands who is not Trudeau. One of his first acts as prime minister
was to cancel Trudeau’s consumer carbon tax, taking one of Poilievre’s most effective targets out of the campaign. (In
his book, Carney wrote the tax was a “model” for the world.)
Opponents have sought to slam him as “just like Justin,” an elitist who doesn’t do his own grocery shopping. They have
questioned his work for an asset management firm and suggested his portfolio, which he has put into a blind trust,
leaves him vulnerable to conflicts of interest. Carney has at times bristled at questions about his assets.
Few of the criticisms have stuck.
Polls show voters view Carney as best placed to handle Trump — a top campaign issue. At least as far back as 2021, he
was warning that Canada’s dependence on U.S. markets was “unhealthy.” He has vowed to diversify Canada’s trading
partners and to negotiate a new trade and security relationship with Washington.
Carney is benefiting from the emergence of an anti-Poilievre coalition. Left-of-center voters who might ordinarily
support the New Democrats or the Bloc Québécois are giving the Liberals a look, in part, to stave off the populist’s
ascent. Poilievre’s “Canada First” slogan and anti-“woke” rhetoric have invited comparisons to Trump, whose attacks
on Canada have stirred a rally-around-the-flag moment.
Kathryn Sheridan normally casts a ballot for the New Democrats. But in this election, her priority is to prevent a
Conservative win. Poilievre, she said, uses “similar tactics” to Trump, and she opposes his plan to defund Canada’s
public broadcaster.
“To fight for democracy, it’s necessary to vote for Carney,” the 56-year-old geologist said.
Defending Canada’s sovereignty is the main issue for Lois Powers. She has concerns about what Poilievre’s war on
“wokeism” would mean in practice, she said, and was drawn to the Liberals by Carney’s international experience.
“He really understands what’s happening in world politics,” said Powers, 65. “And with everything that’s happening
right now, I think that’s a voice that Canada really needs.”

‘blackmail’
Stock markets in Asia rose on Tuesday, even after Trump threatened an additional 50 percent
tariff on Chinese products if Beijing does not rescind its retaliatory duties.
Updated Beijing sharply criticized President Donald Trump’s threats to impose an additional 50 percent tariff on China as
“blackmail” Tuesday, ratcheting up the tensions between the world’s two largest economies amid a burgeoning trade
war.
“The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a
statement. “China will never accept it. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.”
Despite concerns about a further escalation, markets in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe rebounded after Monday’s
steep losses. Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained more than 6 percent during Tuesday trading, while Australia’s ASX 200 ended
the day just over 2 percent higher, and South Korea’s KOSPI tentatively crossed into positive territory.

In Europe, exchanges in Britain, France and Germany all showed gains between 1 percent and 1.8 percent in early
trading.
The Chinese government took several measures to stabilize stocks, boosting Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index — where
many Chinese exporters are listed and which lost 13.2 percent on Monday, its worst day since the Asian financial crisis
of 1997. It was poised to end Tuesday trading in positive territory. The Shanghai and Shenzhen indexes both closed
slightly higher.
Some of those rebounds were investors recouping Monday’s losses. But they also reflected “slight glimmers of hope out
of the U.S. that maybe there is some room for compromise,” said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist for HSBC.
That hope, however, was tempered by the worsening rhetoric between Trump and Beijing and rising chances of a
global recession.
Trump threatened Monday to impose additional 50 percent tariffs on China if Beijing did not “withdraw” its retaliatory
measures on Tuesday, a move that would take duties on Chinese-made goods to at least 104 percent — and in some
cases more.
Trump presidency
“Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!” Trump wrote on
his Truth Social platform. “Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking
place immediately.”
Trump’s threat and China’s response marked a “very precarious new chapter for the trade war,” said Neumann, who
put chances of a global recession at roughly 40 percent. “It means that the tariffs that were announced last week aren’t
the upper ceiling, that they could be pushed much higher depending on how countries react.”
The reaction from Chinese state media Tuesday was defiant.
“The U.S. is wielding its tariff cudgel again,” said the People’s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist
Party, in a foreign affairs column. “China has the capacity and confidence to manage the shock.”
China’s response showed it is “willing to hold the line,” said Feng Chucheng, founding partner of Hutong Research, an
independent consultancy in Beijing.
“This is not just a gesture to send a signal to Trump, but also to send a signal to the rest of the world that China is
willing to put up a fight against this bullying behavior of Trump,” he said.
Chinese companies, meanwhile, rushed to boost confidence in the market amid trade uncertainty. Several state-run
firms, including Central Huijin Investment, a unit of a Chinese sovereign wealth fund, have announced plans to
increase Chinese stock holdings to maintain market stability, according to state media. China’s central bank also
pledged to support Central Huijin’s move.
Andrew Collier, an expert on China’s economy at the Harvard Kennedy School, said that those purchases do nothing to
change the Beijing’s underlying economic challenges.
Chinese leader Xi Jinping “is facing a lot of economic pressure domestically,” Collier said, including from a property
sector crisis, which may push him to the negotiating table with Trump.
While China reacted defiantly to Trump’s blitz, other leaders across the Asia-Pacific region launched efforts to
negotiate.
Trump signaled Monday that he was open to cutting deals with countries to ease tariffs, even as White House officials
continued to suggest there would be no quick end to new import duties.

“We’re going to get fair deals and good deals with every country. And if we don’t, we’re going to have nothing to do with
them,” Trump said in an Oval Office appearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “They’re not going
to be allowed to participate in the United States.”
Countries including Israel, Taiwan and Vietnam have offered to drop their duties on goods from the United States as
part of a deal to avert Trump’s tariffs from taking effect.
Some 50 to 70 countries have been in contact with the White House to negotiate, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said
Monday.
Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba urged Trump to reconsider tariffs on goods from his country during a Monday
phone call, warning that the measures could lead to a drop in Japanese investment in the United States.
Trump mentioned the call on his social media platform, calling the tariffs “tough but fair” and saying that Japan would
be sending a “top team to negotiate.”
“They have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade,” Trump wrote. “They don’t take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of
theirs. Likewise Agriculture, and many other ‘things.’”
But Trump and Bessent — whom the president tasked with leading the negotiations — also expressed optimism about
talks with Japan.
South Korea’s trade minister, Cheong In-kyo, is scheduled to visit Washington on Tuesday to discuss the blanket 25
percent tariff Trump announced for the nation’s goods.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government had also contacted the Trump administration over
the 10 percent tariffs it faces despite Australia’s large trade deficit with its closest military ally.
Albanese, who has warned of the impact of steeper U.S. tariffs on Australia’s Asian trading partners, refused to rule out
a recession on Tuesday as he campaigned ahead of a May 3 federal election.
Any U.S.-Australia trade talks could be complicated by a steady drumbeat of criticism from Republicans over
biosecurity measures that prevent the importation of American beef.
“Australia has sold $29 billion worth of beef in the United States, and we haven’t been able to sell one hamburger in
Australia because of barriers,” said Sen. John Barrasso (Wyoming), the chamber’s second-ranking Republican.

Emmanuel Felton;Maegan Vazquez,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/26/2025,"U.S. citizen children deported with moms, raising due process concerns","Three U.S. citizen children from two different families were deported with their mothers by Immigration and Customs
Enforcement during the early hours of Friday morning. One of them is a 4-year-old with Stage 4 cancer who was
deported without medication or the ability to contact their doctors, the family’s lawyer said.
According to their lawyers, both families were taken into custody while attending routine check-ins this week in New
Orleans as part of the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, which allows individuals to remain in their
communities while undergoing immigration proceedings. Lawyers say the families were taken to Alexandria,
Louisiana, a three-hour drive from New Orleans, where they were prevented from communicating with their family
members and legal representatives and then put on a flight to Honduras.
The cases have renewed concerns that the Trump administration’s expedited deportations are violating the due process
rights of both citizens and noncitizens.
“I don’t know how much more of a blatant or clear constitutional violation there can be than deporting U.S. citizens
without due process,” said Alanah Odoms, executive director of the ACLU of Louisiana. “Especially with some of those
citizens being the most vulnerable of all vulnerable, children, and not just any children, children with medical
conditions that are dire.”
The U.S. government has never released data on how many U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained or deported by
ICE. But independent investigations have revealed that ICE has arrested, detained, deported and issued detainers —
requests to local jails to hold a person in custody — for thousands of citizens since the agency’s creation in 2003.
Lawyers representing the father of the 2-year-old U.S. citizen who was deported, identified as V.M.L. in court
documents, filed an emergency petition in the Western District of Louisiana on Thursday seeking her release. The child
was put on a plane to Honduras the next morning before the court opened.
Hours after the deportation, U.S. District Judge Terry A. Doughty, a Trump appointee, issued an order expressing his
concern that the girl had been deported against her father’s wishes while stressing it is “illegal and unconstitutional” to
deport U.S. citizens.
“The government contends that this is all OK because the mother wishes that the child be deported with her,” wrote
Doughty, who has been lauded for his conservative rulings in the past. “But the court doesn’t know that.”
Doughty set a May 16 court hearing to investigate his “strong suspicion that the government just deported a U.S. citizen
with no meaningful process.” The order did not call for the girl’s return or recommend any recourse for the family.
According to court filings, the girl had accompanied her mother and 11-year-old sister to the immigration appointment
in New Orleans on Tuesday morning. About an hour later, her father, who had driven the family into New Orleans for
the meeting, received a call informing him that the family had been taken into custody. That night, the girl’s father was
allowed to speak with her mother for only a minute before an ICE agent ended the call, lawyers contend. Lawyers say
the man did not get the chance to speak to his partner or child again until after they were released in Honduras.
“Both of these mothers were held without the ability to speak with their co-parents and the guardians of their children
while making this incredibly personal and difficult assessment about what was best for their children,” said Gracie
Willis, the lawyer for V.M.L.’s father.
Justice Department lawyers argued that “the man claiming to be V.M.L.'s father” had failed to prove his identity to the
government despite requests that he present himself to ICE agents, adding that he had also “demonstrated
considerable hesitation” regarding the inquiries into his immigration status. The man’s lawyers included V.M.L.’s birth
certificate in their fillings, which shows she was born in Baton Rouge and lists the names of both her mother and
father.
The government is not disputing the immigration status of any of the three children. Instead, officials contend that the
undocumented mothers opted to take their citizen children with them back to Honduras. In their court filing, Justice
Department lawyers attached a note they say was written by V.M.L.’s mother saying that she was taking the child with
her to Honduras.
“It is common that parents want to be removed with their children,” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the
Department of Homeland Security, told The Washington Post.
Willis says ICE’s refusal to allow the women to talk to their lawyers meant there was no way to verify whether that was
true in these cases.
“We have absolutely no idea whether they ever actually did give consent for their children to come with them or if they
did under what kind of duress and what other options were presented to them,” Willis said.",NA
Brian Murphy,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/26/2025,"Alexis Herman, labor secretary raised in segregated South, dies at 77","Alexis Herman, who as a child in Alabama watched Ku Klux Klan members assault her father and who rose to become
the nation’s first Black labor secretary in a tenure that included intense mediation to end a strike by United Parcel
Service workers in 1997, died April 25 at age 77.
The death was announced in a statement from the Labor Department, which Ms. Herman led from 1997 to 2001 under
President Bill Clinton. No other details were given.
Ms. Herman’s ascent in Washington began as head of the Labor Department women’s bureau in the Carter
administration in the 1970s, followed by high-level roles with the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s
transition team after his election victory in 1992.
She also formed a consulting partnership in the 1980s with a former assistant secretary in the Labor Department,
Ernest G. Green, who was once at the center of the civil rights movement as one of the nine Black students escorted by
federal troops into a Little Rock high school in 1957 under a desegregation order.
That two-track résumé by Ms. Herman brought Republican claims of possible favor trading that stalled a Senate vote
on her appointment to succeed Robert Reich as labor secretary.
GOP lawmakers questioned Ms. Herman’s role in organizing White House meetings — described as “coffees” — with
Democratic Party donors and business leaders. Her former consulting partner Green took part in some of the coffees,
including with prospective business associates.
Ms. Herman’s Republican critics in Congress also raised past accusations that she and Green helped funnel federal
contracts and grants to projects backed by Democrats in the months before President Jimmy Carter left office in
January 1981. Ms. Herman denied any improprieties from the Carter- and Clinton-era dealings and no inquests were
launched.
Eventually, Ms. Herman gained wide bipartisan support for her nomination. She was confirmed in late April 1997 in a
85-13 Senate vote — but only after Clinton made a GOP-ordered concession. He called off plans to issue an executive
order encouraging union labor on federal construction contracts.
Ms. Herman was soon thrown into a major labor clash. More than 185,000 UPS workers went on strike in August 1997
amid a dispute with management over issues such as demands for expanded hiring and improved pay and benefits for
part-time employees.
Backed by the powerful Teamsters union, the strike cut off one of the main pipelines for package delivery and sent
ripples throughout the economy. Ms. Herman set up a mediation hub at a hotel on Capitol Hill, shuttling between
Teamsters headquarters and UPS envoys in near-round-the-clock meetings.
“I wasn’t trying to be subtle,” Ms. Herman said on NBC’s “Today” show. “I was trying to be very direct. I moved in with
them.”
After two weeks of talks, a settlement seemed close. Ms. Herman called Clinton and asked for help to push an accord
over the finish line, she recounted.
Clinton told reporters that he had a “gut feeling” both sides were near an agreement. Then he added a not-so-subtle
message to the strikers: “Right now, the Teamsters have public sentiment on their side, but that will turn.”
The next day, the 15-day strike was over with company pledges that included more full-time positions and wage hikes.
Ms. Herman was lauded by Teamsters and other unions for what they saw as evenhanded mediation. “I never wanted
to entertain failure as an option,” she told CNN.
She remained with the Clinton administration for the rest of his second term, leading initiatives such as boosting the
hourly minimum wage to $5.15 and directing her department to probe Toys R Us for alleged child labor law violations
by assigning teenage employees to excessive work hours, leading to a $200,000 fine imposed on the company in 1999.
She stood by Clinton when he was impeached by the House in 1998 on charges of lying under oath and obstructing
justice to cover up an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. (Clinton was not convicted in the Senate.) The
White House, in turn, showed backing for Ms. Herman as she faced ethics probes.
Attorney General Janet Reno assigned an independent counsel, Maine-based attorney Ralph I. Lancaster Jr., to
investigate claims of illegal campaign solicitation by Ms. Herman and allegations by a Cameroonian businessman
working in the United States, Laurent Yene, that Ms. Herman accepted kickbacks.
In 2000, a report by Lancaster concluded that Ms. Herman had not violated any laws, and she was cleared. “As I said at
the start of this inquiry, nearly two years ago, Secretary Herman did nothing wrong,” Clinton said. (In 2002, Ms.
Herman’s former consulting firm partner Green was sentenced to 90 days of home detention and fined $10,000 for
failing to declare income from a planned business venture.)
Shortly before the end of Clinton’s term, Ms. Herman gave interviews that often looked back on her childhood in
segregated Mobile, Alabama, and the risks taken by her father, a political organizer who led outreach to Black voters.
When she was 5 years old, her father’s car was forced off the road by KKK members, she recalled.
She was given a pistol by her father as he stepped out to confront the Klansmen, she said. She cowered in the car while
he was beaten by the gang.
“For me to serve as the first African American in the Labor Department in a country that was built on slave labor and to
work now with all the labor,” she told CBS News, “that was humbling.”
Alexis Margaret Herman was born in Mobile on July 16, 1947. Her father became leader of a political ward, and her
mother was a teacher.
Ms. Herman said she took early inspiration from her parents’ activism to challenge White authorities seeking to keep
Black voters from casting ballots. “And just how dangerous it was even to have the conversation about voting,” she told
USA Today, “let alone to be organizing.”
At a Roman Catholic-run high school, she was once suspended for questioning why Black students were not included in
religious pageants. In 1969, she received a bachelor’s degree in sociology from Xavier University of Louisiana and
began work with groups seeking to desegregate parochial schools in Mobile.
She then moved to Atlanta, where she led a program at the Southern Regional Council to bring Black and other
minority women into managerial and technical jobs. She caught the attention of Carter, then the governor of Georgia,
who brought her to Washington after his presidential election win in 1976.
After the Carter administration, Ms. Herman supported D.C. Mayor Marion Barry’s successful reelection bid in 1982
and worked on the presidential campaigns of the Rev. Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988. She later served as a top aide to
DNC Chairman Ronald H. Brown, who went on to serve as commerce secretary under Clinton.
When Brown was killed in a U.S. military plane crash in 1996 in Croatia, the memorial service and other events
honoring his life were organized by Ms. Herman, who was then White House director of public liaison.
In 2010, Ms. Herman was appointed to the board of the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, a group co-founded by Clinton and
former president George W. Bush to aid Haiti following a devastating earthquake that claimed more than 200,000
lives.
Her husband of 14 years, physician Charles Franklin Jr., died in 2014. He had three children from previous marriages.
Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.
After their wedding in February 2000 at Washington National Cathedral, Ms. Herman told reporters that she and
Franklin would not be together for their first Valentine’s Day as a married couple.
“I’m spending it with the Teamsters,” said Ms. Herman, who went to Atlantic City to address a union gathering as labor
secretary.",NA
Maegan Vazquez,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/5/2025,"As Trump tariffs sink in, conservatives challenge whether they’re legal","A growing number of conservatives are challenging President Donald Trump’s wide-reaching tariffs on allies and
adversaries alike, with some questioning whether he has the authority to implement them.
One of the first legal challenges isn’t coming from a fleet of corporate litigators for one of the many American
companies forecasting that the import taxes will have a significant effect on their businesses. It’s coming from an
influential, conservative-backed legal nonprofit representing a small stationery company.
And in a Congress where both chambers hold a GOP majority, two Republicans — the longest-serving member of the
Senate and a battleground district Nebraska representative endorsed by Trump last year — are leading the legislative
branch’s hamstrung, bipartisan attempt to push back on the tariffs.
The New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) filed a complaint this week over the legality of Trump’s tariffs launched earlier
this year on all Chinese imports, representing Florida-based Simplified, a stationery company owned by Emily Ley.
The NCLA, a legal nonprofit with conservative backers such as industrialist Charles Koch and judicial activist Leonard
Leo, was behind the lawsuits that led the Supreme Court to overturn a principle known as the Chevron deference last
year, sharply curtailing the power of federal agencies to regulate vast parts of American life.
The alliance argues that Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the levies
was unconstitutional because it does not authorize the president to impose tariffs; rather, it authorizes specific
emergency actions, such as sanctions or freezing assets, to protect the nation from foreign threats. Trump also used the
IEEPA to launch global “reciprocal” tariffs Wednesday.
“No prior president ever thought the IEEPA allowed him to set tariffs. Reading this law broadly enough to uphold the
China tariff would transfer core legislative power,” NCLA President Mark Chenoweth said in a statement. “To avoid
that nondelegation pitfall, the court must construe the statute consistent with nearly 50 years of unbroken practice and
decide it does not permit tariff setting.”
Though the lawsuit does not take issue with Trump’s declaration of an opioid-related emergency, the NCLA says that
the decision to impose wide-reaching tariffs as a response was made without legal authority.
“His China Executive Orders show no connection between the opioid problem and the tariff he ordered — much less
that the tariff is ‘necessary’ to resolve that problem. The means of an across-the-board tariff does not fit the end of
stopping an influx of opioids, and is in no sense ‘necessary’ to that stated purpose,” according to the complaint filed
Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, Pensacola Division. “In fact, President Trump’s
own statements reveal the real reason for the China tariff, which is to reduce American trade deficits while raising
federal revenue.”
The lawsuit, which claims the new tariffs “will impose hundreds of thousands of dollars” in costs on Ley’s business,
names the United States, Trump, the Executive Office of the President, the Department of Homeland Security, U.S.
Customs and Border Protection and the agencies’ leadership as defendants. The plaintiffs are asking the court “to
declare the China import tariff unlawful, vacate the increase reflected in the U.S. tariff schedule, and enjoin this tariff’s
implementation and enforcement.”
White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said in a statement that the president “has broad
authority to impose tariffs to address issues of national emergency, such as the opioid pandemic. The Trump
Administration looks forward to victory in court.”
Responding to the lawsuit, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem defended the president’s decision to impose
tariffs.
“For too long, America has been targeted by unfair trade practices that made our supply chain dependent on foreign
adversaries, eroded our industrial base, and hurt American workers. This has gravely impacted our national security.
President Trump’s strong action will help make America safe again,” she said. “[The Department of Homeland
Security], primarily through [Customs and Border Protection], is ready to collect these new tariffs and put an end to
unfair trade practices.”
Economists say Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on trillions of dollars of goods will raise costs for consumers and
increase the odds of a recession. But the pushback from a conservative-backed nonprofit and a small, woman-owned
stationery business comes as the corporate response has been relatively subdued.
Business leaders have been reluctant to publicly express concerns about Trump’s erratic tariff strategy, people familiar
with discussions between the White House and leading companies previously told The Washington Post, lest they lose
their seats at the table or become a target of the president’s attacks — just as law firms, universities and other large
institutions have.
On Capitol Hill, there’s been growing discontent with Trump’s tariffs among GOP ranks. While House Republicans
have been publicly supportive, many of them have been privately nervous about how Trump’s tariffs will shake out if
they become permanent. Some Republican senators have been more openly skeptical, but their authority to do
something has been limited by members of their own party.
On Wednesday, in a largely symbolic vote, Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Mitch McConnell (Kentucky), Lisa
Murkowski (Alaska) and Rand Paul (Kentucky) joined Democrats in a 51-48 vote rejecting the national emergency
declaration Trump used to justify his plan to set 25 percent tariffs on Canadian imports.
On Wednesday, Trump announced a 10 percent tariff that would apply to imports from every nation and a separate set
of what he called “reciprocal” tariffs that impose a higher country-specific rate. On Thursday, after the announcement
sent global stock markets tumbling, Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Maria Cantwell (D-Washington) introduced a
bill requiring Congress to approve any tariffs within 60 days of their proposal by the president. The legislation also
would require the White House to provide an analysis of a tariff’s impact on businesses and consumers.
And in a rare form of public pushback against the president by a Republican who’s part of a conference that’s broadly
loyal to Trump, Rep. Don Bacon (Nebraska) said Friday that he plans to introduce the House’s companion bill to
Senate legislation aimed at bolstering Congress’s role in authorizing tariffs.
However, House Republican leaders included language in a procedural vote last month to prevent the chamber from
voting on any proposed bill that would end Trump’s national emergency declaration against Mexico, Canada and
China, effectively shielding House Republicans from taking a hard vote that could rebuke the president. That means
Bacon’s bill cannot be voted on by this Congress.
Trump’s sweeping tariffs also have brought concerns from a group he’s long listened to — prominent conservative
media personalities.
The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board, as well as guests on Fox News and Fox Business, criticized Wednesday’s
move. Longtime Trump friend Sean Hannity acknowledged the backlash, saying Thursday: “The playing field is now
getting leveled. … It’s a little messy in the beginning.” And Ben Shapiro, co-founder of the Daily Wire, said the
president’s tariffs are “probably unconstitutional” and also illogical.
A photo of Trump on Saturday signaled that some of the criticism is on his radar. The snapshot showed him reading a
New York Post story about the tariffs on China.
Highlighting some of “the good” and “the bad” about the latest round of tariffs, a headline on the page in Trump’s
hands reads, “Beijing retaliates with 34% duties as stox crash.”

Brianna Tucker,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/26/2025,"Trump can’t withhold funds from ‘sanctuary’ cities, federal judge says","U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick said a presidential executive order violates the Constitution’s
separation-of-powers principles and spending clause.
Updated A federal judge on Thursday blocked the Trump administration from pulling federal funds from San Francisco, Santa
Clara County, and 14 other cities and counties it deems “sanctuary jurisdictions,” handing another legal blow to
President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration.
U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick of the Northern District of California granted the preliminary injunction and in
his order cited a similar executive action from the Trump administration in 2017 — which Orrick also presided over
and blocked — that attempted to halt funds and was found to be unconstitutional nationwide.
Orrick referred to precedent in that ruling and in his order said again that such spending powers are constitutionally
vested in Congress. He said attempts by the president to place conditions on federal funds violate the separation of
powers.
The administration is restrained and enjoined “from directly or indirectly taking any action to withhold, freeze, or
condition federal funds from the Cities and Counties,” Orrick wrote, mandating that the Trump administration
“provide written notice of this Order to all federal departments and agencies” by Monday.
“President Trump received a resounding mandate to put Americans and America First, and the administration will
continue to prioritize the wellbeing of our citizens above all else,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a
statement to The Washington Post.
In the months since he took office, Trump has moved quickly and aggressively to coerce local law enforcement agencies
to actively assist with his plans for mass deportations.
Their participation is considered critical because of the limited resources and staffing of U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement, and some administration officials are reportedly frustrated that the pace of arrests and deportations has
failed to meet the president’s expectations.
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit include Seattle; San Diego; Portland, Oregon; and New Haven, Connecticut, among others.
In the filing, the plaintiffs said that restrictions on Justice Department grants, outlined in a Feb. 5 memo from Attorney
General Pam Bondi, could lead to the defunding and elimination of a wide range of public safety initiatives. Among
them are programs to assist victims of rape, combat carjackings and provide forensic analysis for criminal
investigations.
In siding with the plaintiffs, Orrick also agreed that the “threat to withhold funding causes them irreparable injury in
the form of budgetary uncertainty, deprivation of constitutional rights, and undermining trust between the Cities and
Counties and the communities they serve.”

Abigail Hauslohner;Missy Ryan,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/24/2025,Senators challenge Hegseth on civilian deaths in Yemen strikes,"Democrats have demanded the Trump administration account for a rising loss of life from its
intensified campaign against Iranian-backed militants.
Updated Three Senate Democrats called on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Thursday to account for the scores of civilians
reportedly killed in recent U.S. military strikes meant to target Houthi militants in Yemen.
Sens. Chris Van Hollen (Maryland), Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts) and Tim Kaine (Virginia) warned Hegseth that
President Donald Trump’s repeated claim that he would be a “peacemaker” in his second term “rings hollow.”
Such a “serious disregard” for life calls into question the Trump administration’s ability to conduct military operations
“in accordance with U.S. best practices for civilian harm mitigation and international law,” the senators told Hegseth in
a letter obtained by The Washington Post.
A spokesman for Hegseth, Sean Parnell, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a statement, a defense official indicated that the Defense Department is “aware of reports” that U.S. strikes in
Yemen have led to civilian casualties and “takes these allegations very seriously and has a process to review them” — a
reference to guidelines enacted under Trump’s predecessor requiring regular public reports on civilian harm cases.
Since early 2024, the United States has been engaged in what the military has described as a predominantly defensive
campaign against Yemen’s Houthis, an Iranian-backed group that controls much of western Yemen. In response to
Israel’s war in Gaza, Yemeni militants launched a sustained assault months earlier on U.S. and foreign ships traversing
the narrow Red Sea shipping lane off their coast, imperiling global commerce.
Monitoring groups say the Trump administration has shifted the approach, moving from mainly striking Houthi
military infrastructure to targeting its leaders. According to Airwars, a Britain-based watchdog organization, U.S.
strikes were estimated to have killed 27 to 55 Yemeni civilians in March. The estimated casualty toll in April to date is
believed to be much higher.
So far the Trump administration appears to be “choosing targets that pose a more direct risk to civilians and may
indicate a higher tolerance to the risk of civilian harm,” Airwars said this month.
The United Nations assessed that casualties, a term that encompasses both those killed or injured in a military
operation, tripled from February to March to a total of 162, the senators wrote in their letter. “In addition, the strikes
have moved beyond targeting Houthi missile launch sites to hitting urban areas,” including civilian infrastructure, they
added.
A U.S. strike last week on a fuel depot in the Yemeni port of Ras Isa — which U.S. Central Command described as “not
intended to harm the people of Yemen” — killed more than 70 people, according to Houthi leaders and local news
reports. The Post could not independently verify that figure.
The senators have implored Hegseth to account for the number of Yemeni civilians killed so far and asked him to
describe the efforts that the Defense Department has undertaken to avoid such casualties. They also asked whether the
department is even tracking reported civilian deaths after the Trump administration’s recent steps to curtail civilian
protection activities set up at the Pentagon under President Joe Biden.
Hegseth, a combat veteran and former Fox News personality, has voiced disdain for restrictions imposed on U.S.
forces’ ability to operate and said he supports “rules of war for winners.”
“Our enemies should get bullets, not attorneys,” he wrote in his 2024 book “The War on Warriors,” lamenting that
suspected fighters captured by U.S. forces benefited from access to attorneys.
During his confirmation hearing in January, Hegseth was asked whether the U.S. military under his leadership would
abide by the Geneva Conventions and prohibitions on torture. “What we are not going to do,” Hegseth responded, is
put international conventions above Americans.
“I am extremely concerned that this administration is eliminating the safeguards we use to prevent civilian casualties,
and that we use to ensure accountability with international humanitarian law,” Van Hollen, the lead author of the
letter, said in an interview Thursday.
Such conduct runs counter to American values, he added, but it also threatens American security interests. “As military
leaders have made clear: If you don’t minimize the loss of civilian life, not only are you potentially violating
international humanitarian law, but you’re undermining the goals of your mission.” In Yemen, “you only fuel more
anger at America among the population when you kill scores of civilians … [and] you risk the Houthis gaining more
recruits to their cause.”
The administration’s efforts to dismantle civilian harm mechanisms will “undermine years of work to learn from past
mistakes and improve how the U.S. prevents and responds to civilian harm — work that actually began under the first
Trump administration,” said Annie Shiel, U.S. advocacy director at Center for Civilians in Conflict, noting that many of
those efforts arose from bipartisan legislation passed by Congress.
Yemen, one of the world’s poorest countries, has long commanded outsize global attention as a hotbed for al-Qaeda
militants and other extremist activity. And successive U.S. administrations — particularly that of President Barack
Obama — have drawn international outrage for civilian casualties that have resulted from U.S. drone strikes or other
assaults on suspected militants.
Lawmakers from both parties grew increasingly outraged during the nearly decade-long bombardment of the Houthis
by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which carried out the campaign using U.S.-supplied weapons. The
carnage fueled a humanitarian crisis that, together with the bombardment, resulted in the deaths of hundreds of
thousands of Yemenis, according to the U.N. and humanitarian groups.
The Trump administration’s intensified offensive in Yemen appears to have rankled some influential voices within the
GOP, who have warned of endless wars and depleted U.S. weapons stockpiles at a time when many national security
experts say the U.S. should be prepared for a potential conflict with China.
“Why did we have to do this? Is it part of our constitution that we must be bombing someone at all times?” far-right
commentator and Trump ally Ann Coulter wrote on social media last month.
Trump’s vice president, JD Vance, argued against the strikes in a private exchange with Hegseth and several other
senior administration officials that was inadvertently shared with the Atlantic magazine’s top editor last month.
“I think we are making a mistake,” Vance wrote.",NA
Maeve Reston,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/27/2025,JB Pritzker’s speech in New Hampshire drives presidential campaign buzz,"Pritzker’s speech in New Hampshire drives presidential
campaign buzz
The Illinois governor drew wide applause as he urged Democrats to abandon efforts to
compromise with “a madman” when he spoke in a key state on the road to the 2028 presidential
nomination.
Updated MANCHESTER, N.H. — In a fiery address to New Hampshire Democrats on Sunday night, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker
condemned what he described as President Donald Trump’s “authoritarian power grabs” while also blasting the “do-
nothing” Democrats in his party — stating it is “time to fight everywhere, all at once.”
The billionaire Democratic governor repeatedly brought the crowd to its feet with acidic attacks on the morals and
ethics of the president, adviser and top donor Elon Musk, as well as members of the president’s Cabinet. He slammed
their efforts to dismantle government programs that the most vulnerable Americans rely on and said the Democratic
Party must “abandon the culture of incrementalism that has led us to swallow their cruelty.” It is time for his party, he
said, to “knock the rust off poll-tested language” that has obscured “our better instincts.”
Pritzker was most searing in his condemnation of what he cast as the Trump administration’s infringement on the
rights enshrined in the Constitution, stating that it should be easy for Democrats to say, “It’s wrong to snatch a person
off the street and ship them to a foreign gulag with no chance to defend themselves in a court of law.”
“Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption. But I am now,” Pritzker said to
a standing ovation accompanied by whistles and cheers from the audience. “These Republicans cannot know a moment
of peace. They must understand that we will fight their cruelty with every megaphone and microphone that we have.
We must castigate them on the soap box and then punish them at the ballot box.”
Calling out Trump’s “xenophobia” and thirst for power, the Illinois governor said Democrats must “stop thinking we
can reason or negotiate with a madman.” His hope, he added, is that Republicans who enable Trump “feel in their
bones that when we survive this shameful episode of American history,” their portraits will be relegated “to the
museum halls reserved for tyrants and traitors.”
Turning to his own party, Pritzker argued that Democrats have spent too long listening to voices who “would tell you
that the house is not on fire, even as they feel the flames licking their face,” and called out politicians “whose simpering
timidity served as a kindle for the arsonists.”
Nearly six months after Kamala Harris’s loss to Trump in the presidential election, the 2028 Democratic contest has no
obvious front-runner. While Pritzker and the other likely contenders have demurred on questions about their White
House ambitions, Democrats nationally are frustrated with their leaders in Washington and are looking for a new
standard-bearer to chart the direction of their unpopular party.
New Hampshire Democrats are also eager to reassert their historical role in vetting White House aspirants. Joe Biden
and his allies in the Democratic National Committee essentially bypassed the state in 2024 by stripping its first-in-the-
nation status to make South Carolina first on the nominating calendar as they tried to shore up Biden’s reelection
prospects.
Pritzker’s speech at the New Hampshire Democratic Party’s annual McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club Dinner marks the first
major appearance this cycle of a 2028 White House hopeful in a pivotal early primary state, drawing an audience of
more than 800 people for the party’s annual fundraiser.
In a 2028 field that is likely to be dominated by governors, Pritzker has positioned himself as one of the most forceful
and consistent critics of Trump’s actions while pointing to his record in Illinois as a template for improving the lives of
working-class voters.
While other governors took a wait-and-see approach in the early weeks of Trump’s term, Pritzker said, local law
enforcement officials in Illinois would not cooperate with the Trump administration’s massive deportation operation,
except if it involved the removal of convicted violent criminals. He condemned Trump’s pardons of Jan. 6 rioters and
barred more than 50 people from Illinois who had been granted pardons or commutations by Trump from being hired
by state government, calling their conduct “disgraceful.”
Pritzker, who is an heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune, has been an outspoken critic for months about how the Trump
administration’s cuts are affecting veterans, early-childhood education and seniors. He has also been sounding the
alarm about the GOP’s potential Medicaid cuts, which he said could cost a million people coverage in his state. He is
bullish about the Democrats’ chances of regaining power in 2026 and beyond.
“I think we’ve got the best argument of all about who can rebuild the country and rebuild these programs after the
Republicans tear them down,” Pritzker said in an interview. “From day one of [Trump’s] administration, it’s been a
steady drumbeat of attack on constitutional norms and on programs that are really important to some of the most
vulnerable people in our society.”
One of Pritzker’s advantages among the potential White House aspirants is his ability to swing at Trump from a solidly
blue state where the legislature is controlled by Democrats. From the outset, he took a more combative approach than
other potential rivals such as Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Democrats
who represent narrowly divided states and initially emphasized their interest in bipartisan collaboration with Trump.
Pritzker also has not faced the same kind of constraints as other top contenders such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom,
who was one of Trump’s top antagonists in 2024 but now needs Trump’s cooperation to help him secure the nearly $40
billion in federal disaster aid that he has requested to rebuild Pacific Palisades and Altadena after the devastating fires
in January.
Governors from both parties, who are responsible for balancing their state’s budgets, are facing challenging economic
headwinds because of Trump’s tariffs, his administration’s layoffs of federal workers and the potential loss of a critical
safety net for many poor and disabled Americans if the GOP-led Congress makes deep cuts to Medicaid — a program
that is funded jointly by the federal and state governments.
Facing a president who is both punitive and transactional, governors such as Whitmer have been testing the powers of
quiet diplomacy with Trump.
While seated next to Trump at the black-tie dinner for governors at the White House in February and in two
subsequent White House meetings, Whitmer has intensely lobbied Trump and members of his administration to invest
in a fighter mission at the Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Macomb County, Michigan, noting its strategic position
at the international border.
The Air Force had been slated to phase out the A-10 aircraft at the base. But while addressing Selfridge during their
recent Oval Office meeting, Trump told Whitmer in front of the cameras that he thought “we’ll be very successful
there.” And he is planning a visit to Macomb County, where the base is located, on Tuesday to celebrate his first 100
days in office.
Though manufacturing in Michigan could be harmed by Trump’s tariffs — with about 20 percent of the state’s economy
tied to the auto industry — Whitmer also walked a careful line on that issue in a recent speech in Washington. She said
she shared Trump’s goals of making “more stuff” in America and “bringing good-paying, middle-class manufacturing
jobs back home,” adding that she was “not against tariffs outright.” But she argued that it is illogical to use the “tariff
hammer to swing at every problem without a clearly defined end goal.”
Whitmer was rebuked by some Democrats who believed she gave too much latitude to Trump. Colorado Gov. Jared
Polis, another likely contender for the White House in 2028, called Trump’s tariffs “reckless” and responded directly to
Whitmer’s speech by arguing on social media that “the ‘tariff hammer’ winds up hitting your own hand rather than the
nail.”
Newsom ensured that California was the first to sue the Trump administration over the economic impact of the
president’s tariffs, arguing that Congress was “sitting there passively as this guy wrecks the economy.” And Shapiro
recently toured businesses and industries in Pennsylvania that would be most impacted by the tariffs, accusing the
president of creating chaos and confusion with his policies.
Pritzker, for his part, said Sunday night that the country’s small businesses “don’t deserve to be bankrupted by
unsustainable tariffs.”
And he did not show any restraint in taking on members of Trump’s Cabinet in sharply personal terms. He charged
that Trump has a secretary of education “who hates teachers and schools” and an attorney general “who hates the
Constitution.”
He reserved perhaps the harshest attacks for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Defense
Secretary Pete Hegseth.
“Autistic kids and adults who are loving contributors to our society don’t deserve to be stigmatized by a weird nepo
baby who once stashed a dead bear in the back seat of his car,” Pritzker said of Kennedy.
He alluded to Hegseth’s troubled history with alcohol and the allegations of sexual assault against him, and argued that
military service members don’t deserve to be told they can’t serve in certain roles because they are “Black or gay or a
woman” by “a washed-up Fox TV commentator.”
Pritzker also suggested that Trump’s crackdown on protesters on college campuses in the name of antisemitism is a
farce. The Ukrainian American governor, who is Jewish, spoke of his own ancestors’ history fleeing Russian pogroms in
the 1880s.
“Let me say this to Donald Trump: Stop tearing down the Constitution in the name of my ancestors,” he said. “Do not
claim that your authoritarian power grabs are about combating antisemitism. When you destroy social justice, you are
disparaging the very foundation of Judaism.”",NA
Jeff Stein;Aaron Gregg;Taylor Telford,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/7/2025,Trump threatens additional 50 percent tariffs on China as markets slump,"Trump suggests openness to deals, threatens new tariffs on
China
The president said he would impose major additional duties on Beijing if it did not rescind its
response to U.S. tariffs. Stocks closed mostly flat after wild swings early in the day.
Updated President Donald Trump on Monday signaled that he was open to cutting deals with countries around the world to ease
tariffs, partially stabilizing markets that have been rattled by an intensifying trade war.
While Trump and many White House advisers continued to suggest there would be no quick end to new import duties,
the president also fueled optimism that deals with individual countries could avert worst-case economic scenarios.
Major stock indexes closed largely flat after sinking for several consecutive days since the White House unveiled major
new tariffs last week.
After a dizzying session, the S&P 500 ended down just 0.2 percent Monday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite
index was barely positive. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which contains just 30 stocks, closed down just shy of 1
percent.
“We’re going to get fair deals and good deals with every country. And if we don’t, we’re going to have nothing to do with
them,” Trump said in a joint Oval Office appearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “They’re not
going to be allowed to participate in the United States.”
Still, Trump and his advisers also gave numerous indications that the trade war could intensify before easing. The
president rejected the idea of pausing tariffs before they are implemented to allow agreements to be reached.
“It’s the only chance our country will have to reset the table because no other president would be willing to do what I’m
doing or to even go through it,” he said. “Now, I don’t mind going through it because I see a beautiful picture at the
end.”
Through interviews and social media posts, Trump and his team made clear over the weekend and on Monday that
there would be no speedy end to the import duties announced last week. Peter Navarro, a senior White House aide,
dismissed conciliatory gestures by Vietnam as insufficient to reach a deal. The White House quickly shot down rumors
on social media Monday that a delay in implementing the tariffs was under consideration. And Trump threatened
additional 50 percent tariffs on China in response to the retaliatory measures introduced by Beijing — which would
take duties on some Chinese-made goods above 100 percent. Over the weekend, he amplified claims on social media
that he was intentionally crashing the stock market.
Economists say lasting damage is likely unless Trump quickly reverses the measures he imposed last week, adding a 10
percent tariff on all imports to the United States and much higher tax rates for goods from dozens of specific countries.
“All indications from the president and his advisers [are] that they are not backing down. That is shocking given the
performance of financial markets and imminent economic damage,” said Michael Strain, an economist at the American
Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank. “They will have to change course if they want to avoid severe economic
damage and don’t want to be wiped out in the 2026 and 2028 elections.”

Data as of April 7, 4 p.m. ET
Some analysts have remained optimistic that the White House could still reach agreements with foreign trading
partners, paving the way to lower tariffs. Trump said last week that tariffs “give us great power to negotiate,” and his
advisers over the weekend stressed that more than 50 countries have reached out seeking deals. These messages have
added to the overall economic confusion, while also providing some hope for investors that the tariffs may prove short-
lived.
“It’s really hard to see how we get out of this. But the silver lining is these things were put on with a flip of a switch and
can be taken off at the flip of a switch,” said Scott Lincicome, director of general economics at the Cato Institute, a
center-right think tank. “But that’s really cold comfort for everyone right now. … It’s just uncertainty on steroids at this
point. The objective is totally unclear.”
Trump threatened the new 50 percent tariff for Chinese goods after Beijing on Friday matched the 34 percent tax rate
that Trump had announced for imports from China. The president said the higher total was a response to the
retaliation.
“If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8, 2025,
the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9,” the president posted on Truth
Social. “Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!”
Other signs emerged Monday of intensifying trade hostilities. Vietnam offered to take its tariff barriers to zero, but
Navarro said such a move “means nothing to us” because the White House wants the country to address its “nontariff
cheating,” which he identified as intellectual-property theft and other mechanisms. Trump announced a 46 percent
“reciprocal” tariff rate for Vietnam last week, using a formula that many economists say is badly flawed.

Investors seeking conciliatory signs from the White House had their hopes dashed early. Stock indexes suddenly rose
in the morning on reports that Kevin Hassett, a top Trump adviser, said the White House would consider a pause on all
countries but China. Markets quickly retreated yet again as it became clear that the speculation was based on a Fox
News interview in which Hassett did not make that suggestion. The White House dismissed the report as “fake news.”
Markets fell after the administration clarified Hassett’s comments, rose again, and fell once more after Trump’s Truth
Social post.
The extraordinary volatility captured the unease on Wall Street.
Stocks are facing another week of “elevated uncertainty about tariffs, their duration and the potential for more
retaliation,” said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth in Minneapolis. She noted that investors
are puzzling through what makes sense under new tariff regimes.
“While the past few days in markets have been unsettling, market readjustments to unexpected events are often swift
and brutal as traders search for a new floor and work new information into their models,” Schleif said Monday in
comments emailed to The Washington Post. “This current volatility was exacerbated since stocks were trading at
record highs and elevated valuations back in February heading into this market correction.”
Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday and Friday was about 80 percent higher than the daily
background, according to D.C.-based stock analyst Michael Farr. In April 2020, by comparison, early in the
coronavirus pandemic, trading volume was 40 percent higher.
Tremors continued Monday as markets across the Asia-Pacific region and Europe traded sharply lower. The Hang Seng
Index in Hong Kong fell by 13.2 percent, its worst one-day plunge since 1997. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 7.8
percent, the lowest since October 2023. In Europe, Germany’s DAX fell by nearly 10 percent at the open before
trimming losses, while the Stoxx 600 was down more than 4 percent.
The Cboe volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” climbed nearly 7 percent Monday to reach its highest
level of volatility since 2020.
Richard Saperstein, chief investment officer of Treasury Partners in New York, attributed the “swift and sudden”
market decline to investor efforts to reprice amid “an impending recession from the burden of tariffs.”
“The uncertainty of trading partner retaliation is still weighing on the markets,” Saperstein told The Post. “Markets
won’t rebound until tariffs are negotiated and reduced, until valuations move even lower to very compelling levels, and
until fundamentals improve, and none of these factors are in the cards at this time.”
Some relief could come from the Federal Reserve in the form of “emergency policy easing if economic conditions
deteriorate and unemployment spikes,” Saperstein noted. But the central bank faces a quandary “due to the rising
inflationary pulse that could occur from tariffs.”
Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist for the Blue Chip Daily Report, warned investors to keep more cash on the
sidelines amid the volatility. “There is no real blueprint to model current market conditions against,” Tentarelli said in
a note.
As stocks keep slipping, Wall Street has begun pushing back on Trump’s economic agenda.
In his annual letter to shareholders, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned that tariffs are likely to increase
inflation and have led many to “consider a greater probability of a recession” at a time when prices are already
elevated. He also cautioned that a trade war could damage economic relationships that have been vital to the nation’s
“extraordinary standing in world affairs.”
Bill Ackman, a billionaire hedge fund manager, called for a “90 day timeout” on tariffs in an X post over the weekend,
arguing that waging economic war “on the whole world at once” could destroy confidence in the United States “as a
trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital.”
There are early signs that the stock tumult is causing investors to reassess stakes in riskier assets, a trend that could
eventually make it more expensive for everyday Americans and businesses to borrow money.
On Friday, investors withdrew $1.3 billion from exchange-traded funds holding corporate loans with junk credit
ratings, a record outflow, according to a JPMorgan Chase research note. At the same time, the “spread,” or difference
in yield, widened between junk bonds and safe assets such as Treasury securities.
“Junk spreads should be considered the canary in the coal mine,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.
“Widening credit spreads are often a harbinger of a general credit crunch that, if it were to spill over into the real
economy, would cause a recession.”",NA
Siobhán O'Grady;Serhiy Morgunov,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/26/2025,"Trump, Zelensky discuss peace in Ukraine at Pope Francis funeral","Trump meets Zelensky, then threatens new sanctions against
Russia
Zelensky used the funeral of Pope Francis to launch a diplomatic blitz to head off a U.S. proposal
to end Russia’s war on Ukraine on terms favorable to Moscow.
Updated KYIV — President Donald Trump met briefly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope
Francis’s funeral Saturday, their first face-to-face encounter since their Oval Office blowup in February, and then
threatened new sanctions against Russia.
Zelensky used the rare gathering of world leaders in Rome to launch a diplomatic blitz, meeting with several European
leaders in an effort to head off a U.S. proposal to end Russia’s war with Ukraine on terms favorable to Moscow.
Trump, meanwhile, took to social media to criticize Russian President Vladimir Putin for recent missile attacks on
civilian areas in Ukraine. It was his second public rebuke of the Russian leader since a missile strike on an apartment
building in Kyiv on Thursday killed 12 people and wounded nearly 90 others.
“It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with
differently, through ‘Banking’ or ‘Secondary Sanctions?’” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Too many people
are dying!!!”
The quiet, one-on-one conversation between Trump and Zelensky in St. Peter’s Basilica came before the funeral of a
man who had repeatedly advocated a just end to the war.
The intimate setting in the Vatican contrasted starkly with the chaos in the Oval Office meeting, at which Trump and
Vice President JD Vance berated Zelensky before journalists handpicked from conservative outlets.
“Very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results,” Zelensky wrote on X after the
meeting Saturday. “Thank you @POTUS.”
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha shared a photo of the moment on X. Trump and Zelensky sit facing each
other knee-to-knee, leaning in to talk.
“No words are needed to describe the importance of this historic meeting,” Sybiha wrote. “Two leaders working for
peace in St. Peter’s Basilica.”
The Trump administration is attempting to end the war, which has cost hundreds of thousands of lives since Russia
launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbor in 2022. Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Putin for the
fourth time on Friday.
The United States this month proposed a “final offer”: Washington would recognize Russia’s illegal annexation of
Ukraine’s strategic Crimean Peninsula and acknowledge other territorial gains, and would ease sanctions if the fighting
stopped.
The pro-Russian proposal stunned Ukraine and its European allies. Kyiv insisted on a ceasefire before it would discuss
territory. Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio canceled plans to attend high-level meetings scheduled for
Wednesday in London, and the meetings were abruptly downgraded.
On Wednesday, Trump said he found Russia easier to work with than Zelensky. Hours later, Russia bombed Kyiv.
Europe renewed its support for Ukraine’s position on a ceasefire. Trump then urged Putin on social media to “STOP!”
The White House is trying urgently to fulfill Trump’s campaign pledge to bring a quick end to the war but has thus far
failed to achieve progress.
Russia, which maintains a military advantage on the front line, has little reason to stop fighting. The sides agreed in
March to refrain from striking each other’s energy infrastructure for 30 days, but they disagreed on the start date and
ended up accusing each other of violating the truce.
Putin unilaterally declared a 30-hour ceasefire for Easter, and Kyiv said it would mirror it. The truce briefly halted
airstrikes on Ukrainian cities but slowed fighting on the front line only slightly, and Russia promptly resumed its
attacks just after midnight Sunday. Moscow did not respond to Ukraine’s request to extend the deal.
European leaders drafted a text to counter the U.S. proposal that addressed some of Ukraine’s major concerns,
including the ceasefire. It is not clear whether Washington is willing to consider a new text.
It’s also not clear what document or ultimatums Witkoff might have presented to Putin on Friday. “Putin repeated that
the Russian side was ready to resume talks without any preconditions,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told
reporters Saturday.
The statement appeared to suggest Russia was still not prepared to accept a full truce ahead of talks. Such an impasse
will be difficult to overcome.
But Europe’s steadfast support for Zelensky was apparent on Saturday. The leader clocked face time with allies from
across the continent, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, a powerful partner who helped coach him through
the aftermath of his White House visit; French President Emmanuel Macron; Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni;
and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
“Seeing Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky talking about peace at the funeral of the Pope of Peace has a such huge
meaning,” Meloni wrote on X. “Today has been a historic day.”
Zelensky was greeted by a huge round of applause as he arrived at the funeral on Saturday.
Other meetings between top Ukrainian and U.S. officials also took place around the funeral. Sybiha, the foreign
minister, and Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine’s presidential office, met Saturday with White House Chief of Staff Susie
Wiles and national security adviser Michael Waltz. “Grateful for the constructive work, ongoing engagement, and the
strong partnership between our countries. We keep moving forward,” Yermak wrote.",NA
Matt Viser;Theodoric Meyer,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/30/2025,Trump urges patience amid economic concerns,"Trump urges patience, blames Biden after weak economic
news
The latest news crystalized several economic forecasts that have warned of a possible recession
and have been one of Trump’s biggest vulnerabilities.
Updated President Donald Trump lashed out Wednesday morning at increasingly dim economic forecasts that have cast his
policies in a harsh light and clouded what he had hoped would be a valedictory marker of his 100 days in office.
He has blamed the Federal Reserve. He has expressed anger at what he has described as unfair trade policies of the
past, and bluntly said that Americans may have to stomach paying more and getting less. And, more than anything, he
has blamed his predecessor.
“You probably saw some numbers today,” he said at the start of a Cabinet meeting at the White House. “And I have to
start off by saying, that’s Biden; that’s not Trump.”
It was an echo of a social media post a few hours earlier — “This is Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s,” he wrote —
even though the financial falloff has occurred since he took office and Trump on the eve of his inauguration had
pointed to a stock market that had “surged” and called it “the Trump effect.”
“I’m not taking credit or discredit for the stock market,” he said, when asked about the hypocrisy of claiming credit for
good news and casting blame for bad. “I’m just saying that we inherited a mess.”
His social media post concluded with a message to Americans about the economic policies he has implemented that
have rocked the domestic and global economies: “BE PATIENT!!!” And during a Cabinet meeting, he suggested that
American consumers may have to adapt.
“Somebody said, ‘Oh the shelves are going to be open,’” he said. “Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of
30 dolls. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.”
He was reacting after new data showed that the U.S. economy shrank in the first three months of 2025. The contraction
marked a stark reversal after nearly three years of solid growth and represented a reaction to many of Trump’s policies.
His promised tariffs have compelled companies and consumers to rush to purchase foreign goods, leading to an
increase in imports. A drop in government spending has also caused growth to slow.
The new report on gross domestic product, released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Wednesday morning,
showed that the economy contracted in the first quarter by an annualized rate of 0.3 percent. It was the first
deceleration of the U.S. economy since the pandemic-fueled supply-chain woes of early 2022.
“We have a lot of things going,” Trump said during the Cabinet meeting. “These are quarterly reports. We took over on
January 20th. The tariffs haven’t kicked in yet.”
The figures are in part based on the threat of the tariffs, and economists worry that they could get worse once the new
duties are in place. But as Cabinet officials went around the room to tout their first 100 days, several focused on the
tariffs as a fundamental shift that will be seen as an accomplishment.
“They said you wouldn’t be able to do global tariffs. We did it,” said Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative.
“They said everyone would retaliate. No one retaliated outside of China. They said no one would come to negotiate.
We’re talking to dozens of countries. They said no one would have offers. We have dozens of written offers. We have
lots of countries in this week.”
The latest news crystalized several economic forecasts that have warned of a possible recession and have been one of
Trump’s biggest vulnerabilities on a topic that won him the presidency for a second time. As president, Joe Biden long
struggled to gain credit for positive economic indicators, which Trump exploited with promises of lower prices and a
fairer trade system.
Financial markets all dropped Wednesday morning, reversing some earlier gains after Trump’s tariffs caused a sell-off.
And for one of the first times since Trump took office, Democrats began to rally around a consistent message.
“This is not Joe Biden’s economy, Donald,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) said. “It is your
economy. It is the Trump economy.”
Former vice president Kamala Harris was scheduled to deliver a critique in California of the Republican who defeated
her in the presidential election in November.
The Senate rejected a resolution Wednesday evening to scrap Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs on most countries by
undoing the national emergency he declared to impose them. The vote was 49-49. Three Republicans — Sens. Lisa
Murkowski (Alaska), Susan Collins (Maine) and Rand Paul (Kentucky) — voted with Democrats for the measure. But
Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island), both of whom backed a similar
resolution this month to undo Trump’s tariffs on Canada, did not vote.
Paul, a leading critic of Trump’s tariffs, argued that many Republican senators privately dislike them and will start to
speak out if the economy continues to weaken.
“I think if we went through another quarter of negative growth and/or another scare in the marketplace, I think there
will be more visible voices against the tariffs,” Paul told reporters.
But other Republicans largely defended Trump, arguing that Biden bore at least some of the responsibility for the
economy’s contraction.
“I don’t see this as any reflection on this president’s economic policies,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) said. “Most of
his economic policies weren’t even in place until the second quarter.”
Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) told reporters that the tariffs would take time to bear fruit. He
also suggested that the massive bill Republicans are drafting to cut taxes and increase spending on defense and border
security would help the economy if it passes.
“They’re playing the long game,” Thune told reporters, referring to the White House’s tariff strategy. “Overall, the
things we’re going to be doing to support, help the economy on taxes and regulations and energy are going to have a
positive impact long-term. The tariff issue is something that, like I said, it’s an open question.”
Sen. Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina) cautioned that while Trump can blame Biden for today’s economic numbers, the
same strategy won’t work in six months.
“There is some argument to say that some of this is a lag from the prior administration, but once you get elected you
own the economy,” Tillis said.
White House senior trade adviser Peter Navarro put a positive spin on the numbers, saying that most of the dip in GDP
was related to temporary impacts of Trump’s tariff policy.
“We had a fairly extraordinary surge of imports that was totally driven by the rest of the world trying to get their
products in here before the tariffs took full hold,” he said. “So the great news about that is that’s a one-shot deal. So
next time we get the data, that won’t be the case at all. And in fact, it’ll reverse, and that’ll contribute to growth.”
He also pointed toward pledges from several prominent companies to expand manufacturing in America and a possible
congressional bill that would lower taxes. And he suggested that declines in consumer and business sentiments were
related not to Trump’s policies but to negative media coverage of them.
“The idea that there’s a recession coming should be heavily discounted,” he said. “Because when we take into effect the
tax cuts coming and the underlying strength of the economy, then I think all things, all things, are good.”
The White House in recent days has focused on promoting Trump’s first 100 days in office, with a barrage of briefings,
interviews and events.
Trump held a rally Tuesday night in Michigan in which he railed against the news media and repeatedly said polls were
biased against him. He claimed his approval rating was in the 60s or 70s rather than what most surveys have shown —
around 40 percent.
As he has throughout his presidency, he blamed Biden for the economy, for immigration and for not looking better in a
bathing suit. Over the course of his 90-minute speech, he mentioned his predecessor two dozen times, at one point
polling the crowd on whether they should refer to Biden as “Sleepy Joe” or “Crooked Joe.”
Trump also returned to a theme of blaming Jerome H. Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, for not lowering
interest rates.
“I have a Fed person who’s not really doing a good job,” Trump said. “But I won’t say that. I want to be very nice. I want
to be very nice and respectful to the Fed. You’re not supposed to criticize the Fed. You’re supposed to let him do his
own thing. But I know much more than he does about interest rates, believe me.”
In an extensive interview with ABC News on Tuesday, Trump was also confronted with the volatility he has injected
into the economy, causing concern among analysts and consumers.
“Well, they did sign up for it, actually,” Trump said. “And this is what I campaigned on.”
He said he would continue to remake the global economy, adding that there could be some short-term pain but that he
was attempting to make long-term structural fixes that would go beyond the tariffs on China he imposed in his first
term.
“You know, I had the best economy during my first term. We had a tremendous economy, tremendous success,” he
said. “We were given credit for a great economy. But I said, ‘We have to fix this. Otherwise it’s just not self-sustaining.’”
He adamantly rejected any notion that there would be major consequences from his tariffs, and he maintained that
China would “eat those tariffs” rather than significantly escalate costs.
“Everybody’s going to be just fine,” he said. “It wouldn’t have been if I didn’t do this. I had a choice. I could leave it,
have a nice, easy time. But I think ultimately you would’ve had an implosion. Our country had inflation that was worse
than they’ve ever had it before.”
Trump has also increasingly pointed toward the costs of average goods, including gas and groceries.
“There were plenty of eggs for Easter,” he said. “They were saying, ‘You won’t have enough eggs for Easter.’ We ended
— my secretary did a fantastic job on eggs. Groceries are down. Everything’s down.”",NA
Liz Goodwin,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/28/2025,Lindsey Graham is accommodating himself to Trump’s foreign policy,"BLUFFTON, S.C. — Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) once ran a presidential campaign in part on launching a
ground war in Syria. He and his best friend in the Senate, John McCain (R-Arizona), toured the world on congressional
trips to argue for more U.S. influence and aid abroad before McCain’s death in 2018.
Now, running for a fifth term in a state that Donald Trump carried by 18 percentage points, the longtime hawk’s
foreign policy tone has evolved, to put it lightly.
“Yeah, I think Europe’s gone woke, don’t y’all?” Graham said to a crowd full of mostly Republican retirees at a town
hall earlier this month, after being asked if he agrees with Vice President JD Vance that the United States doesn’t share
the same culture and values with European nations’ leaders anymore. He said he wants to be “realistic” about finding
an end to the war in Ukraine and Russia, by allowing Russia to retain some of the territory it seized. (Just three years
ago, Graham co-sponsored an effort to ban the U.S. from recognizing any such territory.)
Graham’s journey on foreign policy has helped him get what he needs to survive his next election in 2026: A Trump
endorsement in a state full of Republicans who are often skeptical of him. To keep representing the deep-red state,
Graham, the ultimate political survivor, has reinvented himself time and again — sometimes to the chagrin of base
voters.
“I feel like he just flows with the wind. I really do. Which is not a good thing,” said Jane Rabon, 73, a Republican who
came to hear Graham speak in the Sun City retirement community. “Sometimes I just want to reach out and smack
him.”
Now, Graham is navigating between the old-school foreign policy views that formed him and the political demands of
an increasingly isolationist base, at a time when his close ally Trump is disrupting the geopolitical status quo by
threatening to annex an ally, downsizing U.S. diplomacy and levying tariffs on friendly nations. His national-security-
minded fellow senators still see Graham as someone who can push for a muscular foreign policy with the president,
and Graham remains a loud voice cajoling the administration to take a tougher stance on Iran.
But in an interview this month, Graham said his dialogue with Trump — who has railed against NATO and argued that
European countries are “ripping off” the United States — has changed how he sees America’s place in the world.
“I think he has made me reevaluate some of the things I took for granted,” Graham said of the president, soon after
addressing the crowd of retirees under a giant projection that touted his endorsement. “That American interventionism
has limits. Afghanistan — years and trillions.”
Trump is right that there’s an “arrogance” to Americans jumping into every problem abroad, the longtime hawk added.
That’s a big statement from Graham, who used to be one of the loudest voices criticizing Trump’s view of America’s
place in the world. The senator initially dismissed Trump as a “jackass” when the two were running against each other
for the GOP nomination in 2015. The nadir of their relationship was Trump reading out Graham’s private cellphone
number at a rally — Graham soon had to get a new phone.
But the pair became friends after Trump won, when they started playing golf with each other. That friendship forged on
the green has survived clashes on foreign policy and the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, after which Graham said “enough is
enough” about his friend in a speech on the floor. (Two years later, he endorsed Trump’s 2024 run for the presidency.)
Graham argues that Trump is not an isolationist and that while his “America First” foreign policy is not quite Ronald
Reagan’s “city on a hill” — it isn’t as far off as some of Trump’s critics believe.
“He’s not Ronald Reagan in terms of style and rhetoric. But he’s accomplished something that Reagan had
accomplished — people are afraid of him,” Graham said. “The power of Trump I’ve come to appreciate.”
Graham cited NATO countries spending more on their own defense in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — also
a core demand of Trump’s — as an example of that power.
“Trump’s right — hell, they ought to pay more,” Graham said of Europe. “And you know, nobody else could have done
that. I love John McCain; I love President Bush. Just name a president — Clinton. None of these people could have
done that.”
Graham said he has also learned to ignore Trump’s style and to focus on the results. “I don’t care if he takes Putin on
vacation, as long as we get a good outcome,” he said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Graham’s new realpolitik has alienated some of his former fans, particularly as they watched his tone shift on
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Graham has called for billions in aid to the invaded nation in the past and as recently as February praised Ukraine’s
wartime leader as a great ally and fighter. But after a tense Oval Office meeting in late February during which Zelensky
snapped at Vance, Graham suggested he should resign. “I don’t know if we could ever do business with Zelensky
again,” he said outside the White House.
Mark Salter, McCain’s former speechwriter, said he was “disappointed” in Graham’s new tone on Ukraine. Graham was
spouting nonsense he did not believe as “Trump fluffery,” he said.
“People do what they have to do with Trump, but Lindsey’s reputation was built on his foreign policy views,” Salter
said.
“The idea that foreign leaders have respect for Trump’s strength is laughable,” he added. “He’s destroying the world
order that people like John McCain and, once upon a time, Lindsey Graham … built and resulted in the United States
being one of the most powerful and wealthy countries on Earth.”
But Graham quickly embraced Zelensky anew and spearheaded a bipartisan effort to impose sanctions on Russia if it
does not negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine. In the Senate, national-security-minded members still see Graham as
someone who can advocate for their causes with the administration, which has rapidly dismantled the U.S. Agency for
International Development and fired top military brass.
“I think he’s a bridge between the Trump administration and a more sane and rational view of American self-interest,”
said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut). “Lindsey Graham is very much in what I would call a John McCain
view of the world.”
So some were surprised and dismayed when he rebuked Zelensky after the meeting.
“That really didn’t fit with what I expected from Senator Graham,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Delaware), who has
worked with Graham on foreign policy issues. “But I think when push comes to shove, he is aligned with President
Trump — he is aligned with the direction Trump’s foreign policy is going.”
But Coons added that Graham still appears to be working “tirelessly” to get a good outcome for Ukraine.
During a congressional trip by lawmakers to a security conference in Munich in February, Graham was pushing
European allies to beef up their defenses to contribute more to NATO. (The congressional delegation still calls itself
“CODEL McCain.”) Graham was also seeking to find a “creative” way to provide a security backstop for Ukraine against
Russia in any deal, Coons added.
“At the core, I think Senator Graham is trying to navigate between strongly supporting President Trump and his
agenda and believing in the fight for Ukraine,” he said.
Graham once candidly admitted that being close to Trump helped him stay “relevant” and that his vocal support had
earned him the president’s ear. But it’s less clear if having Trump’s ear will result in any meaningful concessions on
foreign policy.
Graham believes he has changed Trump’s mind in the past, pointing to the “big fight” he and Trump had when the
president wanted to withdraw from Afghanistan in his first term. Later, President Joe Biden withdrew, and the
operation’s failures became one of his biggest political liabilities.
“I think he’s come to realize that getting out of a place doesn’t mean you’re safer,” Graham said. “That pulling out and
leaving the problem behind doesn’t mean the problem goes away.”
Over the years, Graham has expressed alarm about Trump’s push to remove troops in Syria, yank security details from
Republicans he doesn’t like and — most recently — try to reach a nuclear deal with Iran. He recently joined Democrats
in asking Secretary of State Marco Rubio to testify about cuts to U.S. foreign aid and raised alarm about the
department sidestepping Congress, a rare act of GOP oversight of the Trump administration.
Graham said he’s “worried” about the Iran deal negotiations, which are being led by envoy Steve Witkoff with the goal
of preventing the country from developing nuclear weapons.
“The largest state sponsor of terrorism should not be allowed to enrich,” Graham said, urging a deal that does not allow
uranium enrichment. “If you can negotiate that, great. If not, you’re going to have to neutralize the program the best
you can the other way.”
When it comes to a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, however, Graham shows more flexibility.
“I don’t mind trying to end the war in Ukraine; I want it to end, and I don’t mind being realistic,” Graham said. “You’re
not going to kick every Russian soldier out, but you don’t want to entice China to take Taiwan.”
An idea that Graham floated in February — to automatically make Ukraine a member of NATO if Russia ever invades
again — appears nowhere close to becoming reality, as NATO membership appears to be entirely off the table in the
latest peace proposal, which Ukraine has rejected.
Despite his genuine closeness with Trump, Graham faces deep skepticism from some of the president’s supporters in
his state, who booed him at Trump rallies around the state.
One voter at the town hall, Bruni Baker, said Graham is “kind of a RINO,” short for Republican in Name Only. “I have
written him letters when I’m really pissed at him,” she added.
Graham’s rocky relationship with some Republicans in the state dates to Graham’s participation in bipartisan groups in
the Senate dealing with immigration reform and judicial nominees, and continued as he occasionally sparred with
Trump.
Trump is aware of how suspicious many of his supporters are of Graham after the senator was booed at his rallies, said
a longtime Trump adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. But the president
has a good relationship with Graham and appreciates his loyalty. Trump hears him out on issues but doesn’t
necessarily take his advice, the adviser added.
In his endorsement, Trump said Graham “has always been there when I needed him.”
Graham said he was touched by the endorsement.
“This is his last term, and I won’t be around forever,” Graham said. “And I’m trying to help him.”
Mark Lynch, a businessman challenging Graham from the right, is hoping to capitalize on the unrest among the base.
He’s brushing off the impact of Trump’s nod and recently loaned his own campaign $5 million.
“Trump’s endorsement of Lindsey Graham means nothing to South Carolina because we all know Lindsey,” Lynch said.
But political experts in the state believe Trump’s backing is all but decisive for Graham.
“The Trump endorsement freezes the field,” said Joel Sawyer, a GOP political consultant in South Carolina.
Scott Huffmon, a political scientist at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina, was confident that Graham
would find a way through. The senator, he said, “is the ultimate survivor.”",NA

By Matt Viser
When President Donald Trump stood in the Capitol Rotunda to deliver his second inauguration address, he made a
series of proclamations and predications as he declared: “A tide of change is sweeping the country.”
Nearly 100 days after he took the oath, that much has proved unmistakably true.
He has ushered in a dramatic shift far beyond the typical changes that take place every four or eight years, even
bigger than Trump himself did in 2017 when he took office the first time. He has altered in fundamental ways how
the U.S. economy works, how global diplomacy is conducted, and how immigration is enforced. He is working to tear
down and remake the federal bureaucracy, pushing the limits of presidential power, and waging war against the
court system.
As he marks his 100th day in office on Wednesday, Trump has a historically low approval rating with signs of
erosion on two of his top issues, the economy and immigration. He has overseen a drop in the stock market with few
recent precedents, with economists and consumers fearing a rise in inflation and a possible recession.
But inside the White House, there is broad agreement that Trump has laid the foundation for vast and far-reaching
changes that will alter the federal government and American society. Senior administration officials are pleased on
the verge of giddy — “every morning I wake up and it’s like living in a dreamscape,” said one top official — and
suggest that his staff and Cabinet are far more united than when he first took office eight years ago, and are able to
oversee more sweeping and more rapid changes as a result.
Donald Trump
They also have far more planned, including more executive actions and a renewed push for congressional legislation,
in what the official described as “lots of torpedoes under the water you’re not seeing right now but soon you will.”
They have ambitions to deport more immigrants this year than any point in American history, with a larger
crackdown coming that includes plans to pay undocumented immigrants to leave the country and providing them
flights to do so.
And there are few signs they will back down on challenges with the courts, arguing that they are fighting a
philosophical battle about the power of the presidency.
“The obvious comparison point is FDR’s first 100 days,” the senior administration official said, speaking on the
condition of anonymity to discuss the matter more candidly, during a briefing with a group of reporters. “But I think
you’re seeing something much bigger than that. What you’re seeing in a philosophical sense is rejecting all the
failures of the global construct that was created really at the end of the Cold War that has governed U.S. economic
and foreign policy since that time.”
“If you think about what the president campaigned on, they’ve all been implemented with astonishing speed,” the
official added. “These are not tinkering around the edges. These are effectuating 180-degree change.”
They are unraveling a trade and tariff system in place for decades, one that Trump officials say has led to “the self-
mutilation of our economy” and “the great screwing of the American middle class.” And they believe they are
dismantling a federal bureaucracy that has made moving quickly difficult, and has worked against the executive
branch that Trump is elected to represent.
While some of his plans have led to changes, many have yet to be realized and a Washington Post tracker of 31 key
campaign promises finding that eight haven’t happened and five are facing roadblocks. His tariff policy has morphed
several times, causing confusion among foreign economic ministers and Wall Street investors. He has yet to solve
the war in Ukraine, something he once said he could do within 24 hours of taking office.
The S&P 500 is down about 8 percent, putting Trump off to the worst stock market start to a presidency in recent
memory.
Trump has functioned at a dizzying pace. He has signed 139 executive orders — already approaching what Joe Biden
did over four years — but has had only one piece of legislation worthy of a signing ceremony. He has hosted 14
foreign leaders, delivered the longest address to Congress in recent memory, and has spoken to reporters almost
every day.
He has sought to find a foil — mentioning Biden more than 430 times, an average of more than four times every day
of his presidency — but Democrats have struggled to find a consistent message or a prominent leader. Republicans
have largely marched in lockstep, and a number of law firms and universities have acquiesced to his demands.
Joan Hoff, professor of history at Montana State University and former president of the Center for the Study of the
Presidency, said that no president since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 has displayed the rapid pace that Trump has
maintained.
“Nobody since then has tried to flood the country with these controversial projects in the first 100 days,” she said.
“It’s been effective. What he’s doing, I think, is confusing the public — and confusing Democrats in particular — in
how to react to him … It’s kept the Democrats running around trying to figure out what to do.”
Trump has differed, she said, in that Roosevelt was relatively consistent in his approach, while Trump has moved in
fits and starts as he has proposed tariffs and then delayed and altered them, or as he proposed taking over the Gaza
Strip but not doing much to follow through. And while Roosevelt pressed 15 major pieces of legislation through
Congress in his first 100 days, Trump has almost exclusively relied on executive orders.
“That’s an easy, quick way to flood the market and flood national TV coverage,” Hoff said. “He didn’t do that in 2017.
It has to do with a better-organized, radical, like-minded group of advisers round him now that he didn’t have in
2017.”
During the first 100 days, presidents often have a honeymoon phase where the public is more willing to go along
with their priorities and see them in a favorable light, and before they overreach the mandate they perceive
themselves to have. Biden had a 57 percent approval rating at this point in his presidency, while Barack Obama was
at 65 percent and George W. Bush at 62 percent. Trump during his first term was at 41 percent, the only president in
modern history with a higher disapproval rating.
In a Washington Post-ABC-Ipsos poll released Sunday, 39 percent of Americans approve of how he is handling the
presidency, a decline of six percentage points from February.
The poll also finds broad disagreement with many of his policies, including 64 percent disapproving of how he is
handling tariffs, 57 percent disapproving of how he is managing the federal government, and 58 percent saying they
are concerned that Trump will do too much to reduce the size and role of the federal government.
Trump administration officials give little indication of many changes to come, despite the slide in polling and
concerns across the political spectrum about economic turbulence, saying that the pace of executive actions is
expected to continue.
One major priority, they say, is to continue with broad actions on immigration. They are going to increase financial
penalties on illegal immigration, expand enforcement with ICE partnering with local law enforcement, and
emphasize self-deportation. They have plans to offer immigrants here illegally free flights home and cash incentives
paired with increased penalties.
“We think we’ll see people choosing to leave on their own,” one official said. It is unclear how much the payments
would be, or how the funding would be allocated.
The Post reported earlier this month that Trump officials have been aiming for 1 million deportations this year, a
goal that analysts and immigration officials have been skeptical of but one that the White House still seems to be
after.
“We will have this year, I’m confident, the largest number of deportations honestly calculated in American history,”
a senior administration official said.
The next 100 days, a second official said, will be focused on “trade deals, and peace deals.”
While Trump has put off some of his tariff plans and said he is open to negotiating with various countries, his
advisers insist he is committed to seeing them through.
“I don’t think there is anything the president is more resolute about than trade deals and implementing these
tariffs,” one senior administration official said.
Trump, who several times a week signs a series of executive orders in the Oval Office, is expected to continue
pursuing executive actions. But he also wants to hold more signing ceremonies at the White House, and officials say
the coming months are going to be marked by him pressing for more congressional action.
“All of this has been done through sheer executive power and authority,” one of the senior administration officials
said. “But moving forward we expect Congress to get their work done.”
Trump’s burst of activity in his first three months has also been marked by an expansion of presidential power, and a
willingness to openly chastise a judicial system that has sought to limit some of his decisions. Administration
officials have suggested, for example, that they are not bound by court orders to return Maryland resident Kilmar
Abrego García, who the government has admitted was mistakenly sent to a prison in El Salvador.
The courts have also ruled against some of the efforts to slash government spending and eliminate federal jobs
through the U.S. DOGE Service overseen by Elon Musk. Trump’s open criticism of federal judges has triggered
concern among legal scholars who say the country could be approaching a constitutional crisis.
White House officials argue that Trump is doing what voters elected him to do, and show little sign of easing up on
the battle with the judiciary.
“Right now there is a cabal of judges, a small subset of that group, that believe it’s their mission to run out the clock
and make it … impossible to implement his agenda,” said one of the senior administration officials.
The disruptive nature of Trump’s term exceeds what he did in his first term, partly because he came into office more
prepared, after four years out of office, and with several senior advisers having a more specific plan to implement.
But he has also been largely unmoved by outside counsel, and has surrounded himself with loyalists in ways that
have eliminated many of the guardrails of the first term and created less internal opposition.
“There truly is a sea change in attitude among senior staff in the West Wing; there’s trust in one another,” said one of
the senior administration officials. “And a battle rhythm that we hit on day one … You’ve seen the Cabinet. It’s a
completely different bunch from the team he chose in the first term.”",NA
Lily Kuo,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/17/2025,China ramps up propaganda machine to fight U.S. trade war,"China’s propaganda machine is in full churn as Beijing ramps up all of the tools at its disposal to fight a public relations
war with President Donald Trump. It may even have a chance to win.
In the two weeks since Trump launched what he called his “Liberation Day” tariff blitz, Chinese diplomats have taken
to X and Facebook — platforms that are banned within China — to post archival footage of President Ronald Reagan
deploring trade wars and former Chinese leader Mao Zedong declaring China’s determination to defeat the United
States in the Korean War.
Chinese state media have reposted a TikTok video made with AI that shows unhappy American workers sewing
garments and assembling smartphones, with the caption: “Make America Great Again.” Several times a week, the state-
run China Media Group has been sending personalized emails to reporters covering the trade war, offering them
updates on China’s perspective.

For most of the past decade, Chinese officials have been trying to convince the world that China — with its state-
controlled, notoriously protected economy — is the world’s true defender of free trade and globalization. Now, as
Trump levies tariffs against some 90 countries and U.S. relations with allies and trading partners grow tense, China has
a rare opportunity.
Podcast episode
“It is not so much a change in China’s propaganda tactics, but that Trump himself messed up, allowing China’s
propaganda to score points,” said Deng Yuwen, former deputy editor of the Communist Party-affiliated Study Times,
who now lives in the U.S. “The huge controversy caused by the Trump administration has allowed the Chinese
government’s methods to win points.”
Over the trade war, China has matched Trump at each escalation, now levying import duties of at least 125 percent and
restricting U.S. access to critical minerals needed for making high-tech machinery from weapons to electric cars.
Trump has imposed tariffs of at least 145 percent on all Chinese goods, with exceptions for semiconductors and
consumer electronics.
Rhetorically, Beijing has also hit back at every turn. When Vice President JD Vance said this month that the U.S. was
borrowing money from “peasants in China” to then buy goods made by those same peasants, a senior Chinese official
clapped back. “Let those peasants in the U.S. wail in front of the 5,000 years of Chinese civilization,” said Xia Baolong,
China’s top official overseeing Hong Kong and Macao affairs.
In some ways, China is operating by an old playbook: discrediting the United States and stressing how much China is a
responsible global player and dependable partner.
In 2017, during Trump’s first term in office, Chinese leader Xi Jinping emerged as an unlikely defender of globalization
as he gave a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, implicitly criticizing Trump’s emerging
protectionism. This week, Xi embarked on a state tour of Southeast Asian countries, where he has also called for the
multilateral trading system to be upheld.

Now, Beijing is also delivering that message in catchy short videos and snarky memes aimed directly at Americans. A
video posted on Facebook earlier this month by Guo Jiakun, a Foreign Ministry official, featured images of stock
market indexes crashing and streets full of American protesters, while a narrator intoned in English: “The so-called
global beacon now puts America first. … With China here, the sky won’t fall.”
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, who along with Guo joined Facebook in February, posted an
illustration of a “Make America Great Again” hat with a “Made in China” label attached. A price tag shows it has been
marked up from $50 to $77 — reflecting Trump’s announced tariffs on Chinese goods, 54 percent at the time.

Analysts say that Chinese propaganda, historically heavy-handed and often clumsy, has shown some new signs of
sophistication in response to Trump’s tariffs.
By posting videos of Reagan, China’s Foreign Ministry used a conservative icon to criticize the Trump administration.
In the video, the former Republican president says: “If our trading partners can’t sell their products here, they can’t
afford to buy our exports. And that means more lost jobs for Americans.”
The video uses “America to attack America,” according to Wang Zhin-sheng, an assistant professor at the Central Police
University in Taiwan who studies Chinese propaganda.
“That is, to use narratives that are familiar to Americans to attack the corresponding policies of the current Trump
administration,” he said.
Another distinction of China’s recent propaganda push, Wang said, is how much it is targeting U.S. audiences,
especially critics of Trump. By rallying opposition, Beijing — which, unlike other countries, has not rushed to negotiate
with Trump — may be hoping that backlash builds to the point that the president backs down.
“In the past, we all thought that when China did a lot of external and internal propaganda, the audience was mainly the
Chinese people. But this time it is very clear,” Wang said. “Its audience is clearly mainly the U.S., or to be more precise,
the American people who also oppose Trump’s tariff war.”
Analysts say that this time, Beijing does not need to resort to misinformation to get its point across. Instead, the
amount of dissatisfaction within the U.S. and in other countries gives China all the fodder it needs.
China “doesn’t need to create other narratives, and it doesn’t need to create false information. It only needs to amplify
these voices of dissatisfaction,” said Li Weiping, a postdoctoral researcher focusing on disinformation in ethnic media
in the U.S.
The use of videos of Mao — a symbol of resistance to U.S. imperialism — appeals to audiences at home as well as left-
leaning critics of the U.S. elsewhere, she said. Meanwhile, the videos of Reagan appeal to those on the right.
“It’s saying, look, we can all come together to resist America. America is our enemy,” she said, “There is so much
material. If I were a Chinese propaganda worker, I’d definitely do a good job.”
Others have noted that the tone of Chinese diplomats and propaganda seems to have shifted as China’s aggressive
“wolf warrior” diplomacy — the norm during Trump’s first term and most of the Biden administration — has been
replaced by more dispassionate messaging.
“The spokespeople now seem to be less emotional and more under control. They are not trashing the U.S. But they are
not saying anything complicated,” said Clyde Yicheng Wang, an assistant professor in politics and East Asian studies at
Washington and Lee University. He said the shift started before President Joe Biden met with Xi in San Francisco in
2023, a meeting that somewhat repaired deteriorated ties between the two countries.
“They are criticizing the U.S. as usual, but this time … it’s the U.S. that’s disrupting the international order and not
China,” he said. “I think it’s fair to say that the current U.S. administration has been the greatest gift given to China’s
external propaganda.”
Still, China’s overseas messaging is also about its domestic audience. As China prepares to weather the damage the
tariffs will bring — at a time when many Chinese households do not feel confident about their economic futures — the
messaging helps put the blame for China’s economic problems on the U.S.
“This round of propaganda is not only for external use, but also for internal use,” said Deng, the former Communist
Party newspaper editor.
“It plays a big role in making the public more supportive of the government’s tough stance against the United States,”
he said.",NA
Mary Ilyushina,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/25/2025,Top Russian general killed as Witkoff meets with Putin,"Top Russian general killed in Moscow as U.S. envoy talks with
Putin
Russia’s Foreign Ministry called it a “terrorist attack,” and surveillance footage showed a car
exploding as Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik was approaching it in a Moscow suburb.
Updated A high-ranking Russian military official was killed Friday in an explosion in a suburb of Moscow, in what authorities
are treating as a case of murder. The incident coincides with the meeting of President Donald Trump’s envoy, Steve
Witkoff, in Moscow for high-stakes talks with President Vladimir Putin.
The Kremlin disclosed few details following the three-hour meeting between Witkoff and Putin, their fourth in recent
months, as Trump continues to push for a resolution to the three-year war in Ukraine.
Yury Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy adviser, described the talks as “constructive,” saying they helped narrow the gap
between Russian and U.S. positions not only on Ukraine but on several broader international issues. Ushakov added
the possibility of resuming direct negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian representatives was discussed.
As Witkoff’s private jet approached Moscow ahead of the talks, Russia’s Investigative Committee, its top policing body,
launched a criminal investigation into the death of Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, who was killed when a vehicle rigged
with an improvised explosive device packed with shrapnel detonated. Surveillance footage published from the scene
suggests Moskalik was walking past the car at the time of the explosion.
Kommersant newspaper, citing sources close to the investigation, reported that the device was detonated remotely and
that Moskalik had been under surveillance via a camera installed inside the vehicle.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called it a “terrorist attack” and said there were “grounds to
believe” Ukrainian special services had been involved. Ukrainian officials have not publicly commented on the incident.
Moskalik was part of the Russian delegation negotiating the aftermath of Russia’s illegal annexation of Ukraine’s
Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and its limited invasion of eastern Ukraine. He participated in a meeting in 2019 over the
failed peace process that also included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to Russian media.
Russian military bloggers who support the 2022 invasion of Ukraine have reacted strongly to Moskalik’s death. The
influential Rybar channel, run by blogger Mikhail Zvinchuk, who has close ties to the defense establishment, described
Moskalik as “one of the most intelligent and demanding officers in the Main Directorate of the General Staff — not
well-liked, because he demanded results and was relentlessly tough on his subordinates.”
“Given the high-profile nature of the target and the method of execution, there is little doubt Ukrainian special services
were involved,” the channel said of Moskalik’s death.
Rybar compared it to the December killing of Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, head of the Radiation, Biological and Chemical
Defense Forces. The Investigative Committee at the time said Kirillov was killed by a remotely detonated explosive
planted in a scooter parked outside a residential complex in Moscow.
Kirillov was the highest-ranking Russian military official to be killed outside combat since the full-scale invasion of
Ukraine in February 2022. Kirillov’s assistant was also killed. The SBU, Ukraine’s domestic security service, was
responsible for the “special operation,” according to an agency official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to
discuss the sensitive matter.
Ukrainian special services have also previously claimed responsibility for several attacks on high-ranking Russian
military officials. In November, a senior Russian naval officer, Valery Trankovsky, was killed in a car bombing in
Crimea.
An official in Ukraine’s security services told the Ukrainian Pravda outlet at the time that the agency had orchestrated
the attack that killed Trankovsky, the chief of staff of the 41st Missile Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet.
Witkoff is meeting Putin for the fourth time as peace talks have reached a critical juncture. Trump claimed Wednesday
that Russia was ready for a deal, but that Zelensky was proving difficult.
Ukraine accepted a U.S. proposal for a full ceasefire in March, but Russia has not. The White House has since proposed
increasingly generous terms for Russia, including U.S. recognition of Russian sovereignty in the strategic Crimean
Peninsula. Zelensky has demanded a ceasefire before he will talk about concessions.
Trump issued a rare rebuke to Russia on Thursday after an attack on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, calling it “not
necessary, and very bad timing.”
The strike, the latest in a devastating series of Russian attacks on civilians, comes amid growing pressure from the
White House for Kyiv to accept a land-for-peace deal. With no firm security assurances on the table, the proposal is
seen by many Ukrainians as a lopsided agreement that rewards aggression and undermines their sovereignty and long-
term security.
Witkoff has recently presented European and Ukrainian officials in Paris a proposal meant to “represent the final offer
from the United States to both sides,” a deal he is expected to negotiate with Putin.
The proposal floated U.S. recognition of Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Trump in a recent interview with Time
magazine said “Crimea will stay with Russia” as part of the negotiations: “And Zelensky understands that, and
everybody understands that it’s been with them for a long time.”
U.S. recognition of Russia’s claim to Crimea would represent a major victory for Putin’s long-standing objective of
sidelining Washington from its role as a global enforcer.
The deal Witkoff presented in Paris also suggests that sanctions imposed on Russia since 2014 in relation to its
aggression toward Ukraine would be lifted, which would pave the way for the U.S. and Russia to strike deals on energy
and in other industrial sectors.
In Moscow, Witkoff also met with Kirill Dmitriev, Putin’s business envoy in the talks, who has presented multiple
economic proposals to Trump as part of broader negotiations through which the Kremlin aims to normalize relations
with Washington.",NA
Emily Langer,NotNYT,0,WashingtonPost,4/26/2025,"Walter Frankenstein, who hid in Berlin during Holocaust, dies at 100","For years, Walter Frankenstein, a German Jew living in Berlin, watched as the city’s once thriving Jewish population
disappeared. Tens of thousands of Jewish Berliners emigrated in the 1930s amid the antisemitic persecution that
augured the Holocaust. Deportations from the capital began in 1941, first to ghettos and then Nazi death camps in
Eastern Europe.
As conditions worsened, Mr. Frankenstein managed to get by and avoid arrest. But one morning in February 1943, the
18-year-old bricklayer reported for forced labor and learned that his fellow Jewish workers, every one of them, had
been deported the night before.
Stripping himself of the Star of David that marked him as a Jew, Mr. Frankenstein went into hiding with his wife and
infant son. His story of narrow survival — not behind the barbed wire of a concentration camp or in an attic, but on the
run, by his wits and in terror — illuminates an ordeal endured by thousands of Jews but sometimes overlooked in the
popular understanding of the Holocaust.
Mr. Frankenstein, 100, died April 21 in Stockholm, where he had made his home since the 1950s. Klaus Hillenbrand, a
German journalist who chronicled his life in a 2008 book, “Nicht Mit Uns” (“Not With Us”), confirmed his death and
said he did not know the cause.
As the Holocaust fades ever deeper into the past, many people come to know its horrors through works such as Anne
Frank’s “The Diary of a Young Girl,” the account of the two years the teenage author spent in an Amsterdam hideaway
before she and her family were discovered and deported to concentration camps in 1944, and “Schindler’s List” (1993),
the Oscar-winning movie about Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who helped more than 1,000 Jews survive, in
large part by keeping them in his employ.
Mr. Frankenstein’s story “is neither of those,” said Richard N. Lutjens Jr., a historian at Texas Tech University and the
author of the book “Submerged on the Surface: The Not-So-Hidden Jews of Nazi Berlin, 1941-1945.” “Hiding in Berlin,”
he continued, “is its own particular facet of the Holocaust.”
Walter Frankenstein was born on June 30, 1924, far to the east of Berlin in what is now Zlotow, Poland, and was then
the German city of Flatow. He lived in a small home above his family’s general store, which his mother continued to
operate after his father died in 1929.
Mr. Frankenstein was 8 when Hitler became chancellor in 1933. Within months, a boycott of Jewish businesses,
including the Frankenstein family’s store, took effect. At one point, an unknown assailant fired shots at the windows of
the shop.
“Dear God,” Mr. Frankenstein recalled thinking, “if this man doesn’t drop dead in the next fifty meters, then I won’t
believe in you anymore.” Years later he remarked: “He didn’t drop dead, and I became an atheist. I still am, to this
day.”
In 1936, antisemitic measures resulted in Mr. Frankenstein’s expulsion from his school in Flatow. Determined that her
son would receive an education, his mother placed him in the Auerbach Jewish Orphanage in Berlin, where he could
attend one of the city’s Jewish schools.
Mr. Frankenstein’s arrival in Berlin coincided with the 1936 Summer Olympics, envisioned by the Nazi regime as a
showcase for Aryan superiority. Mr. Frankenstein attended the Berlin Games and witnessed the feats of African
American track star Jesse Owens, who made a mockery of Hitler’s racist ideology by collecting four gold medals.
Mr. Frankenstein recalled that he and the other children at the orphanage lived “as if on a small, sheltered island,”
insulated from the worst of the Nazi persecution at the time. A budding athlete, and an adventurous child, he competed
in track and field events, soccer and boxing.
Then came Kristallnacht, a wave of antisemitic violence across Germany in November 1938. When Nazi stormtroopers
arrived at the orphanage and threatened to set it on fire, Mr. Frankenstein and three friends persuaded them to leave,
arguing that the flames would engulf nearby buildings. From the rooftop, he watched as fires blazed across the city.
Mr. Frankenstein attended a Jewish technical school, trained as a mason and while still living at the orphanage met his
future wife, Leonie Rosner, who was three years older and had been hired as an apprentice. They soon left the
orphanage, rented a room in the city and were married in 1942.
While employed as a tradesman for the Jewish community of Berlin, Mr. Frankenstein was forced to work for the Nazi
regime. Once, he said, under threat of deportation, he plastered over a telephone line in the office of Adolf Eichmann, a
chief architect of the Holocaust. Leonie, too, was subjected to forced labor, working in factories throughout her
pregnancy with their first son, Peter-Uri, who was born in January 1943.
By that point, arrests of Jews in Berlin had accelerated, culminating in a roundup known as the Factory Action that
began at the end of February 1943. In a matter of weeks, the Nazis deported approximately 11,000 German Jews to
Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp in occupied Poland, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. They took
many of the victims from the factories where they worked, giving the roundup its name.
Many Jews who remained in Berlin concluded that they had no choice but to go into hiding. They rarely stayed in one
place for long and called themselves “U-boats,” a reference to the German submarines that would dive down into the
sea, rise to the surface and then submerge again. Mr. Frankenstein and his family were soon among the “U-boats.”
Over a period of two years and two months, they sought shelter — sometimes together, sometimes apart — wherever
any semblance of safety could be found. They first fled to Leonie’s hometown of Leipzig, later slipped into a forest of
Berlin and still later took refuge in a factory.
When the factory was destroyed in an air raid, Leonie, who was pregnant again, assumed a non-Jewish identity,
reported that she had been displaced by bombings and, with many other German mothers, was evacuated to the
countryside. Michael, their second son, was born in September 1944.
Mr. Frankenstein, meanwhile, continued to dodge Allied bombs in Berlin. At various times he lived in a stranded car
with no wheels and slept in an opera house. For a period, a Christian woman granted him use of her apartment and
allowances of food. When Leonie and the children returned to Berlin from the countryside, the family lived in a brothel
and, finally, a bunker before Berlin surrendered in May 1945.
By the end of World War II, the Nazis and their collaborators had murdered 6 million Jews across Europe. That figure
includes nearly all of the 60,000 Jews deported from Berlin. Approximately 1,700 Jews survived in hiding in Berlin,
according to Lutjens.
Walter and Leonie Frankenstein lost much of their extended family in the Holocaust, including their mothers, both of
whom died at Auschwitz, according to Hillenbrand.
With little reason to remain in Europe, Mr. Frankenstein joined the Bricha, the underground movement that helped
smuggle Jewish refugees to the British mandate of Palestine, and obtained permission for Leonie and the children to
enter the territory as legal immigrants. He eventually sailed there to join them but was detained for months in Cyprus
before the family was reunited in 1947 after 19 months of separation.
Mr. Frankenstein served in the Israeli war of independence and later worked as a mason and tiler, installing irrigation
systems on kibbutzim. The family lived in Israel without electricity for more than a decade before immigrating to
Sweden in 1956 on the advice of a friend from the orphanage.
Mr. Frankenstein, who became a Swedish citizen, found construction work on a subway station in Stockholm before
studying civil engineering and becoming a structural engineer with a specialty in nuclear power plants.
Leonie died in 2009, and their son Michael died in 2024. Besides Peter-Uri, Mr. Frankenstein’s survivors include many
grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
Before his wife’s death, Walter and Leonie Frankenstein traveled regularly to Germany. They relished German theater
and literature and did not wish to relinquish all ties to the city that had once been their home, Hillenbrand said,
although they preferred to keep company with Germans who were too young to have taken part in the Holocaust.
Mr. Frankenstein spoke frequently to German students and helped organize a memorial erected at the site of the
Auerbach Jewish Orphanage, where more than 150 Jewish children and more than 20 caregivers were arrested and
sent to their deaths after he left, according to Hillenbrand. Mr. Frankenstein was awarded the Order of Merit, one of
Germany’s highest honors, for his contributions to Holocaust remembrance.
Mr. Frankenstein further contributed to the collective memory of his former city by donating to the Jewish Museum
Berlin, which opened in 2001, a collection of more than 1,100 photographs, documents and artifacts from his life. Some
of those photographs, including the ones taken with the camera that he received for his 12th birthday, the year he
entered the orphanage, documented a universe of German Jewish life that had all but ceased to exist.
“It was important to him to preserve the photos,” Theresia Ziehe, a curator at the Jewish Museum Berlin, wrote in an
email, “and, if they survived, to be able to document the past.”
The photographs exist today only because of an act of extraordinary foresight and care by Mr. Frankenstein. When he
went into hiding, he decided that his photographs would go underground as well. Under cover of night, he buried them
along with his Star of David in a tin can in the Grunewald forest of western Berlin.
At the end of the war, Mr. Frankenstein returned to the spot, near a grove of three trees, and unearthed his capsule. It
was safe, like him.",NA

sell key parts of its digital advertising business, which was found to constitute an
illegal monopoly.
The DoJ on Friday told a federal judge that divestments of Google’s ad exchange
and publisher ad server businesses are the only way to break its dominance. The
former is the largest marketplace for bidding for online ad space and the latter is
the technology online publishers use to list and sell ads on their websites.
The tech giant should also be required to share data on real-time ad bidding with
competitors, the DoJ said in a Virginia court. US district Judge Leonie Brinkema

George Hammond,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/1/2025,Judge allows Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI to move forward,"Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI and chief executive Sam Altman has taken a
significant step towards trial after a California judge rejected the ChatGPT maker’s
attempt to dismiss the case.
The ruling keeps the two billionaires on track for a legal showdown as they
compete for primacy over increasingly powerful artificial intelligence.
Musk, an OpenAI co-founder who donated much of the capital to get it off the
ground, claims the group’s ongoing efforts to convert from a non-profit to for-
profit entity constitute a breach of contract and fraud.
The Tesla chief filed a suit against Altman, OpenAI and the $300bn company’s
biggest backer, Microsoft, last year and sought a preliminary injunction to block
OpenAI’s conversion.
OpenAI
A judge denied the request to block in March but also agreed to expedite the trial —
currently scheduled for March 2026 — by holding back some of the claims in the
original lawsuit.
The judge, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the Northern District of California,
dismissed some aspects of the case on Thursday but concluded that Musk’s lawyers
had made sufficiently sound allegations for it to proceed.
“In the world of litigation this is a big win,” said a person close to Musk,
emphasising that Gonzalez Rogers had retained a number of “big-ticket items”,
including Musk’s argument that OpenAI engaged in fraud.
“Musk adequately alleges that the defendants promised to maintain OpenAI’s non-
profit status and structure in order to obtain his contributions, and that they
intended to do so in order to obtain the capital needed to create a for-profit venture
to enrich themselves,” the judge wrote in her ruling.
Gonzalez Rogers also denied OpenAI’s bid to dismiss Musk’s claim that a contract
existed between Musk and OpenAI. “Although there is no express contract, Musk
adequately pleads in the alternative that there is an implied-in-fact contract,” she
wrote.
OpenAI can appeal against the decision.
The company is trying to simplify its novel corporate structure to become a for-
profit public benefit corporation, in part to ensure it can more easily raise capital
from outside investors. It is currently governed by a non-profit board with a
mission to create powerful AI for the benefit of all humanity.
Its efforts to convert to a for-profit have drawn criticism from former employees
and AI experts including Geoffrey Hinton, Margaret Mitchell and Stuart Russell,
who say the move would transfer control of the development of such tools to a
company driven by profits.
OpenAI declined to comment. The company countersued Musk last month,
arguing that his efforts to derail its conversion were “bad-faith tactics to slow down
OpenAI and seize control of the leading AI innovations for his personal benefit”.
Musk is the founder of xAI, which is developing similar technology to that of
OpenAI.",https://www.ft.com/content/a57fc9e7-d4b8-4a14-aa5d-331fd7935f89
Hannah Murphy,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,/30/2025,Meta beats expectations and boosts spending as it shrugs off tariff impact,"Meta has reported better than forecast results and boosted spending as it steps up
its push to lead in artificial intelligence, shrugging off Wall Street fears over a US-
China trade war and economic uncertainty. 
Revenues in the company’s first quarter rose 16 per cent from a year ago to
$42.3bn, beating expectations of $41.4bn, the group said late on Wednesday. Net
income jumped 35 per cent to $16.7bn, well above consensus estimates of $13.5bn.
Meta shares were up more than 6 per cent in pre-market trading on Thursday.
The tech giant forecast its second-quarter revenues would be between $42.5bn and
$45.5bn, with the midpoint of that range slightly higher than Wall Street’s forecast
of $43.8bn.
“Our business is . . . performing very well, and I think we’re well positioned to
navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty,” chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said on
a call with analysts.
Meta Platforms
Zuckerberg has this year doubled down on his plans to make Meta the “AI leader”,
boosting spending to develop its open source large language models and AI
assistant. The company has also been improving the content it recommends in
users’ Facebook and Instagram feeds, as well as the targeting of its advertising, in
moves executives said were already paying off.
Meta estimated total expenses in 2025 in the range of $113bn to $118bn, down
slightly from its prior outlook of $114bn to $119bn.
The bumper results appeared to assuage investor concerns that US President
Donald Trump’s tariffs policy and related economic uncertainty could significantly
knock Meta’s advertising business as well as Zuckerberg’s AI ambitions. Meta
generates about 10 per cent of its revenues from China-based marketers, which
have recently curbed spending.
Susan Li, Meta’s chief financial officer, acknowledged the company had
experienced “some reduced spend in the US from Asia-based ecommerce
exporters” and a drop-off in revenue from China-based advertisers in the gaming
sector.
Meta on Wednesday raised its full-year capital expenditure forecast to between
$64bn and $72bn, from $60bn and $65bn, citing “additional data centre
investments” to support its AI push as well as an “increase in the expected cost of
infrastructure hardware”. Li pointed to “uncertainty” around ongoing trade
discussions as the driver of those potential cost increases.
The results come a day after smaller rival Snap declined to share financial guidance
for the second quarter at its earnings, citing “uncertainty” around economic
conditions in the coming months and “headwinds” in the current quarter. Snap’s
shares closed 12.4 per cent lower on Wednesday.
Meta has made several recent AI announcements as it races rivals such as OpenAI,
Elon Musk’s xAI and Microsoft to dominate in the field of generative AI.
In early April, Meta released the latest iteration of its open source AI model, Llama
4, while on Tuesday it launched a standalone app for its AI assistant, rivalling
OpenAI’s ChatGPT app.
Meta also took a step towards becoming a cloud provider on Tuesday, announcing

Groups in the Topix benchmark collectively unveiled $27bn of buybacks,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,/30/2025,Japan’s share buybacks nearly triple as governance push gains pace,"Share buybacks announced by Japanese companies in April nearly tripled on the
previous year as boards opted for placating investors over holding dry powder for
tariff uncertainties.
Listed groups in the Topix benchmark collectively unveiled ¥3.8tn ($27bn) of
buybacks in April, up from ¥1.3tn in the same month last year, according to figures

Japanese business & finance
The huge increase during the first month of Japan’s financial year follows a record-
breaking ¥20tn of repurchases in fiscal 2024, which analysts described as a
“regime shift” in corporate Japan’s approach to cash hoarding and balance sheet
management.
Investors have historically accused Japanese companies of running highly
inefficient balance sheets and deprioritising return on equity.
But groups are starting to think more carefully about their capital structure,
including returning more money to shareholders if they lack an efficient way to put
it to work, said Hiromi Yamaji, chief executive of Japan Exchange Group, which
operates the Tokyo bourse.
“We are getting into a totally different kind of world,” Yamaji, a key figure in
Japan’s push for stronger corporate governance, told the Financial Times. “So in
other words, whenever [companies] think their share price is too low, they are
trying to use the opportunity to manage the size of their equity.”
Japan’s biggest investment bank and brokerage, Nomura, as well as trading house
Mitsubishi and manufacturing conglomerates Hitachi and Komatsu have recently
announced buybacks in the hundreds of millions of yen.
The April repurchases, which spanned industries including cars, capital goods,
insurance, telecoms and banking, came despite Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba
declaring a “national crisis” over US President Donald Trump’s trade policies.
US tariffs have already hit Japanese car exports and could spell even greater
turmoil if negotiations fail to reduce broader “reciprocal” levies threatened by
Washington.
But Bruce Kirk, Japan equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, said the large buyback
figures showed there was momentum for shareholders’ corporate governance push
“despite all the uncertainty caused by the tariffs and recession fears”.
“Combined with the big corporate structuring announcements from some Japanese
blue-chips this month, there is a lot to be positive about,” said Kirk, noting that
usually a third of all Japanese buyback announcements took place during the
April-May earnings season.",https://www.ft.com/content/61434cdf-29b4-43a4-b3e7-fd7ef8cea22e

gender divide among young people pursuing the subject, according to Bank of

37,251 in 2023, an increase of 60 per cent that made it the eighth most popular

The expansion has helped to narrow the gap in provision between private and

Stephen Morris;Rafe Uddin;Michael Acton,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/2/2025,Microsoft wins Big Tech’s first earnings battle since Donald Trump’s tariffs,"Microsoft has emerged as the winner from Big Tech’s first earnings of the new Donald Trump term,
with the software giant’s tariff resilience helping it leapfrog Apple and retake the crown as the
world’s most valuable public company.
Despite widespread pessimism ahead of its results, Microsoft posted record revenue at its Azure
cloud computing unit, crediting its partnership with OpenAI and demand for its artificial
intelligence-infused software. Those comments provided succour to investors amid fears of a US
recession and concerns that vast expenditures on AI are unjustified.
Apple and Amazon were the major losers, with the iPhone maker budgeting at least $900mn in
extra quarterly costs from tariffs, while the ecommerce giant cut its outlook and warned of higher
prices and plunging consumer spending. Combined, they shed about $180bn in market
capitalisation when Wall Street opened on Friday.
Microsoft had a market cap of $3.2tn at the close in New York on Friday, while Apple slid below
$3.1tn.
Microsoft’s outperformance enabled it to stick with an ambitious plan to spend $80bn on data
centres this fiscal year ending on June 30 and even more in the next, including tens of billions on
new projects in Europe to ensure the US cannot cut off the region’s access to data and computing
power.
“Not only did Microsoft knock the most important number out of the park, but their capex
commentary spelled relief” for the tech sector, said Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at
Melius. “We expect Microsoft to continue to benefit since confidence in Azure has been restored —
and you can’t tariff software.”
Chief executive Satya Nadella, now in his 12th year in charge, has become a steadying figure amid
Silicon Valley’s AI hype bubble. He struck an early partnership with OpenAI that gave Microsoft
privileged access to its lucrative technology — without having to fund the development of frontier
large language models in-house — whilst locking in a large cloud computing client.
Nadella has also argued that his focus on software for businesses rather than more fickle
consumers and a diverse supply chain have made Microsoft the most Trump-proof tech giant.
Big Tech
“Software is the most malleable resource we have to fight any type of inflationary pressure or
growth pressure where you need to do more with less,” he said on Wednesday.
Microsoft’s share price has risen about 11 per cent this week, making it the only member of the so-
called Magnificent Seven — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — to be in
positive territory this year.
Last year, Microsoft lagged behind its Magnificent Seven peers, with its shares rising 12.1 per cent.
The S&P 500 gained 23.3 per cent in 2024.
In aggregate, the seven companies have shed more than $2tn in market value since January 21, the
day after Donald Trump’s inauguration. They took a $1tn hit in a single day of trading on April 3
after the US president laid out “liberation day” tariffs on dozens of trading partners, with the
steepest — currently at 145 per cent — applied to China.
“Microsoft was the big upside surprise and it was even broader than just cloud. Software is doing
very well and the tariff risk is low,” said Jim Tierney, head of the concentrated US growth fund at
AllianceBernstein. “Meanwhile, Amazon, Meta and Apple have to navigate tariffs and the impact
on some of their customers, be it merchants, manufacturers or advertisers in China.”

Rafe Uddin,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/1/2025,Amazon warns on trade war hit as profit outlook misses forecasts,"Amazon warned of the impact of Donald Trump’s global trade war and issued
weaker-than-expected guidance for the second quarter, as the ecommerce giant
grapples with steep tariffs.
The Seattle-based group on Thursday said it expected operating income of between
$13bn and $17.5bn in the current quarter. That compares with $14.7bn a year ago
but fell short of Wall Street’s forecast of $17.7bn.
In financial guidance, Amazon added “tariff and trade policies” to the list of factors
that posed a risk to its earnings.
Chief executive Andy Jassy told investors that the company was well-positioned to
weather the storm and had engaged in forward buying of inventory ahead of the
Trump administration this month imposing tariffs on Chinese imports of up to 145
per cent.
Amazon.com
“We haven’t seen any attenuation of demand yet,” he said, and that average selling
prices had not risen appreciably with tariffs. “There’s going to be plenty of sellers
that [will] decide to pass on those higher costs to consumers.”
Amazon has been negotiating steep discounts with vendors and seeking to damp
the impact of tariffs. It imports roughly a quarter of items it sells from China.
Goldman Sachs analysts said ahead of Amazon’s results that the levies could knock
$5bn-$10bn off the company’s operating profits this year, depending on how the
trade war played out. That would represent a hit of 6-12 per cent on the $79.2bn in
fiscal year operating profit that Wall Street has forecast.
Amazon also forecast net sales in the current quarter to come in between $159bn
and $164bn, with the bottom range falling short of analysts' expectations of
$161.4bn.
Shares in the company were down 2.3 per cent in after-hours trading in New York,
having closed the regular session 3.1 per cent higher.
Amazon’s March quarter revenues rose 9 per cent year on year to $156bn, narrowly
beating estimates of $155bn, according to consensus estimates from S&P Visible
Alpha.
The group’s vast ecommerce platform continued to grow in the first quarter. Net
sales in its online retail division were up about 5 per cent from a year ago.
Amazon this week locked horns with the US government after it emerged that its
ultra-low-cost Haul platform had discussed listing import charges on consumer
products, in a move similar to Chinese rival Temu.
Haul, which ships goods from warehouses in China, will be affected by the removal
of tax exemptions for goods valued at less than $800, from May 2.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday said the proposals were a
“hostile and political act” by Amazon. The group publicly walked back the proposal
after Trump spoke with its founder, Jeff Bezos.
Amazon’s cloud division, which is the biggest contributor to profit, narrowly
missed expectations but continued to show signs of strong growth. Sales at Amazon

Exxon, the largest western oil producer, reported net income of f $7.7bn in the
three months to the end of March, down from $8.2bn a year earlier, and roughly in
line with analysts’ forecasts. Revenue of $83.1bn was up slightly from 12 months
ago, but missed Wall Street estimates.
The oil industry, which enjoyed record profits when prices shot up following
Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, is facing weakening demand for its
products as US President Donald Trump’s trade war causes the global economy to
slow.
The uncertain economic environment has caused analysts to question whether
Chevron and other oil majors can continue to meet commitments to pay out a large
percentage of their profits in shareholder returns.
Chevron said it would cut spending on share buy backs in the second quarter to
$2.5bn-$3bn, compared with $3.9bn in three months to the end of March.
However, it said its guidance for annual buybacks of $10bn-20bn remained
unchanged. Last year Chevron bought back $15.2bn of its shares.
Chevron shares were down 1.8 per cent in pre-market trading in New York on
Friday, but later recovered and were up just over 1 per cent at $138.48 at midday.
Exxon’s shares were up 0.2 per cent.
“Investors have been laser focused on shareholder returns and Chevron’s results
indicate it is unlikely to maintain the high level of payouts against an uncertain and
deteriorating demand environment,” said Michael Alfaro, chief investment officer
at Gallo Partners, a hedge fund focused on regulatory and policy matters in energy
and industrials.

court if necessary to protect European customers’ access to its services, as it tries to

Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, said European leaders were shocked when
Trump temporarily suspended military and intelligence support to Ukraine. The
cloud computing and software giant on Wednesday responded with new
commitments to European governments about “continuity of access”.
His comments come as the region grapples with uncertainty over the US
president’s long-term commitment to the transatlantic security alliance — and
whether he could block access to American technology as leverage in wider

Microsoft’s new pledge includes five “digital commitments” to Europe. The Big

Members of Syria’s security forces deployed,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,/30/2025,Israel launches air strike in Syria as sectarian clashes erupt,"Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Wednesday that Israeli forces had struck what
he said was an armed group preparing to attack a Druze community near
Damascus, amid a wave of sectarian violence in Syria.
The Israeli attack followed several days of clashes between Sunni Muslims and
Druze in southern Syria that have reportedly killed more than a dozen people and
raised questions about how strong a grip the country’s new rulers have on their
armed supporters.
Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said in a joint statement with defence
minister Israel Katz that the air strike in Sahnaya, a town south of the Syrian
capital, had been a “warning operation” and that “a stern message was conveyed to
the Syrian regime: Israel expects it to act to prevent harm to the Druze”.
Syria
The attack is Israel’s latest intervention in Syria since the regime of Bashar al-
Assad was toppled last year by an offensive led by a Sunni Islamist group, which
Israel regards as a threat.
Since then, Israel has carried out huge strikes on Syrian military infrastructure,
seized a five-decade-old buffer zone, deployed forces into parts of southern Syria
and repeatedly threatened a broad offensive if the Syrian state harms the Druze.
The Druze, an ethnically Arab religious minority present in Syria, Lebanon and
Israel, are also increasingly viewed by the new Syrian regime’s supporters as
proxies for Israel: in addition to threatening to intervene on behalf of the Druze,
Israeli officials have denounced the new Syrian government as “a terrorist regime
of radical Islam”.
Syria’s new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, however, has not threatened Israel, and
some Druze leaders — who fear being associated with Israeli aggression — say they
do not welcome Israeli protection.
The Israeli strike came after Syrian state-aligned armed groups attacked Jaramana
and Achrafiet Sahnaya, next to Sahnaya, on Tuesday and Wednesday. The attacks
followed the distribution of a voice recording insulting the Muslim prophet
Mohammed that was allegedly made by Druze religious leader Sheikh Marwan
Kiwan.

Kiwan denied the recording was his, saying in a video that “whoever caused this
strife is an evil man who wants to sow discord among all components of the Syrian
people”. The interior ministry agreed with him after investigating the accusation,
urging calm and promising to deliver justice.
But the damage was done: fighters aligned with the government attacked the two
communities and posted videos of themselves firing heavy artillery. Residents said
Israeli drones could be heard above the towns.
Hundreds of people have been killed in earlier clashes in Syria between pro-
government forces and loyalists of the former regime that escalated into sectarian
violence, drawing furious condemnation from the US. Many of those targeted were
Alawites, members of a minority sect to which Assad belongs and who dominated
the top ranks of the former regime’s security forces.
The interior ministry said it had dispatched members of its General Security forces
to suppress this week’s violence, while the health ministry said the attacks were by
“rogue elements”. According to death notices posted by local monitoring groups, at
least six men and one woman from Jaramana were killed. 
Later on Wednesday, the head of security in the province said an agreement had
been struck with Jaramana’s notables, dictating a ceasefire and the handover of
dead bodies. He too blamed rogue groups for targeting civilians and security
personnel, and said 16 members of the interior ministry’s forces had been killed.

Tehran says the executed man was ‘providing logistical support to multiple Mossad operations,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,/30/2025,Iran executes alleged Mossad spy as concern grows over Israeli sabotage,"Iran said it executed a man convicted of spying for Israel’s Mossad intelligence
agency, accusing him of engaging in acts of sabotage.
The death sentence was carried out early on Wednesday against Mohsen
Langarneshin, an Iranian national. Mizan news agency, which is affiliated with
Iran’s judiciary, said he worked “as a senior spy providing logistical support to
multiple Mossad operations in Iran”. No details were given on his background.
The execution comes at a crucial moment in Iran, with the Islamic republic in the
midst of talks over its nuclear programme with US President Donald Trump’s
administration.
The US is seeking to impose restrictions to ensure that Tehran cannot access a
nuclear weapon in return for lifting severe sanctions that have throttled the Islamic
republic’s economy.
US-Iran tensions
Both the US and Israel have threatened military strikes on Iran if the talks break
down. There is growing concern in Tehran that Iranian nationals who might have
“infiltrated” the country’s security, military and intelligence institutions could aid
Israel in this.
Mizan said Langarneshin had been “in close co-operation with senior Mossad
officers and had met with them in Georgia and Nepal”.
It accused him of being “present at the scene” when Hassan Sayyad Khodaei, a
member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was assassinated in Tehran in
May 2022. It added he provided “operational and technical support for an attack
on an industrial centre affiliated with the defence ministry in Isfahan”.
Iran has previously accused Israel of acts of sabotage against its nuclear facilities
and the assassination of nuclear scientists. 
The Islamic republic, which regularly imposes the death penalty, has in recent
years executed several people it accuses of working on behalf of Mossad.
Rights groups have warned that those sentenced to death do not benefit from due
process, with Human Rights Watch last year saying death sentences were imposed
“indiscriminately” and made “legal protections meaningless”.
Israel has repeatedly said that Iran must dismantle its nuclear programme
altogether, and opposes any deal that could help the republic keep elements of it.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that a deal must
dismantle “all of [Iran’s nuclear] infrastructure”.
Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s foreign minister, accused Netanyahu of “brazenly . . . 
dictating what President Trump can and cannot do in his diplomacy with Iran”.
Araghchi has also accused Israel of seeking to “derail diplomacy” through
“attempted sabotage and assassination operations designed to provoke a legitimate
response”, he wrote on X last week.

Andrew England,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,/30/2025,UK in talks with France and Saudi Arabia over recognising a Palestinian state,"The UK is in talks with France and Saudi Arabia about whether to recognise a
Palestinian state at a UN conference in June.
But Britain’s foreign secretary David Lammy said on Wednesday that the UK
wanted recognition to be part of moves towards a two-state solution to the
protracted Israeli-Palestinian crisis, rather than a symbolic act.
His comments come after French President Emmanuel Macron said this month
that France could use the UN conference to recognise a Palestinian state, as
European and Arab powers step up efforts to find a sustainable resolution to the
crisis triggered by the war between Hamas and Israel.
Israel-Hamas war
The New York conference will be chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, which have
sought to establish a global alliance to push for the establishment of a Palestinian
state alongside Israel.
Speaking to a committee in the House of Lords, the UK parliament’s second
chamber, Lammy said the Labour government would prefer recognition of a
Palestinian state as part of a movement towards a two-state solution to the crisis.
“We will continue to talk to partners about that; President Macron has had a lot to
say about that most recently, alongside the Saudis,” Lammy said.
“It’s unacceptable for any group of people to have lived without no state for longer
than I’ve been alive,” he said. “The only option is two states and we will continue
working with partners . . . particularly with France as we head towards their
conference in New York, alongside the Saudi Arabians . . . to ensure we keep alive
two states.”
Lammy also sounded a note of caution.
“I recognise there are some who see this as symbolic, and there are countries in
Europe that have taken this step recently . . . Did it change much on the ground?
The sad conclusion is it didn’t, and so we have always said recognition is not the
end in [and] of itself, two states is the end.”
Most UN members already recognise a Palestinian state. Several European
countries, including Spain, Ireland and Norway, formally recognised a Palestinian
state last year.
But two European permanent members of the UN Security Council taking a similar
step would be considered a more significant boost to the Palestinians.
However, diplomats say the challenge is deciding when to use recognition most
effectively as a point of leverage with both the Palestinians and Israel, and whether
it be done unconditionally or when certain terms have been met.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right government has repeatedly
ruled out any steps towards a two-state solution, or to make any concessions
towards the Palestinians.
He has been emboldened by the re-election of Donald Trump, widely regarded as
the most pro-Israel American president, who has called for Gaza to be emptied of
Palestinians, taken over by the US and turned into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.",https://www.ft.com/content/2e76d005-141f-4d64-b2b6-a066cf536516
Tim Bradshaw in London;Zehra Munir,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/2/2025,‘Grand Theft Auto VI’ launch delayed until 2026 in blow to games industry,"Take-Two Interactive has delayed the release of the long-awaited next version of
Grand Theft Auto until next year, sending shares in the US video games maker
down 7 per cent in early trading.
The New York-based company said on Friday that Grand Theft Auto VI would be
released in May 2026, later than its previously scheduled launch date of this
autumn and pushing the launch into its next financial year.
The news wiped billions of dollars from Take-Two’s market value and will cast
doubt on hopes that the console gaming market would return to growth this year
after a protracted post-pandemic slump.
GTA VI, which features a Bonnie and Clyde-style criminal couple rampaging
around Vice City, was projected to be the biggest entertainment launch of 2025.
Some analysts forecasting it would generate $3bn in its first year on the market.
Take-Two Interactive Software Inc
Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two’s chief executive, did not give a specific reason for the
delay but said that “we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence”.
In its own announcement, RockStar Games, the Take-Two subsidiary that created
the GTA franchise, apologised and said it needed “extra time to deliver at the level
of quality [players] expect and deserve”.
“With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed
your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception,” RockStar said.
“The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly
humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your
patience as we work to finish the game.”
GTA VI has already been in development for more than a decade, following the
release of the franchise’s previous instalment in 2013. No new footage from the
game has been shown since its first trailer in December 2023.
RockStar is known among players for the cinematic ambition and polish of its
blockbuster games — but also for the delays and tough working conditions that can
accompany such creative aspirations.
“This long-rumoured delay will have a material negative impact on the console
market scale in 2025,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, research director for games at
Ampere Analysis, affecting sales of games and new consoles.
“It’s also a blow to the wider games sector this year, as console gaming was
predicted to experience good performance in 2025 and be an engine for overall
growth . . . We’ll be reviewing and adjusting our forecasts as a result.”
However, the news will come as a boon to other games publishers who had been
fearing the blockbuster launch of GTA would make it hard for other titles to win
attention.
Analysts at Newzoo had been expecting that the combination of GTA VI and
Nintendo’s forthcoming Switch 2 console would drive 10 per cent growth in global
console software revenues this year to $47.3bn, after sales dropped 4 per cent in
2024.
Nonetheless, the delay did not change Take-Two’s expectation of sequential
increases in net bookings in the current and next fiscal year, the company said.",https://www.ft.com/content/06852410-cf31-4f11-b76b-4a33c8e338d6
Mark Carney said King Charles would deliver a speech to open the new parliament,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/2/2025,Canada’s Mark Carney to meet Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday,"Mark Carney will meet Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday in an effort to
revive a crucial trading relationship with the US that the Canadian prime minister
recently described as “over”.
It will be Carney’s first foreign visit since his Liberal party won a general election
on Monday after a campaign overshadowed by the US president’s taunts about
Canada and his tariffs on some of its exports.
Carney in Ottawa on Friday said he had held a “very constructive call” with Trump
and the two leaders had agreed to meet next week in the US capital.
“Our focus will be on both the immediate trade pressures, and the broader future
economic and security relationship between our two sovereign nations,” he said.
Mark Carney
Carney also announced King Charles would deliver a speech to open the new
parliament in Ottawa later this month.
“This historic honour matches the weight of our times,” Carney said of the visit by
the King, who is also Canada’s sovereign. It will be the first time in nearly 50 years
that the monarch takes part in parliament’s opening.
Carney was speaking at his first press conference since his Liberals defeated Pierre
Poilievre’s Conservative party after a campaign dominated by the debate about
Trump and Canada’s relationship with its most important trading partner.
Trump’s mockery of Canada and its former prime minister Justin Trudeau, as well
as the president’s threats to annex the country — which he described as a potential
“51st state” — propelled the Liberal party from a distant second in polls last year to
victory this week.
Relations between the two allies and trading partners have been rocked by the
tariffs announcement despite the US-Mexico-Canada free trade deal that the
president negotiated during his first term.
Carney vowed in a speech after his win on Monday that Trump would “never
break” Canada, and said Ottawa would look to forge new trading alliances with
countries in Europe and elsewhere.
The prime minister on Friday said his meeting in the White House would address
“complex” US tariffs affecting Canada’s automotive, steel and aluminium
industries.
“I go there with the expectation of difficult but constructive conversations,” he said.
Carney, who was previously the governor of the Bank of England, said Trump had
made no reference to Canada becoming a US state on their telephone all.
“This will never, ever happen,” the prime minister said.
Carney, who will lead a minority government after his party narrowly missed
winning a majority of seats in parliament, outlined his vision to “advance the
nation-building investments that will transform our economy”.

Zehra Munir;Andrew Jack,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/2/2025,Donald Trump says he will revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status,"Donald Trump has said he will scrap Harvard University’s tax-exempt status,
threatening to deal a significant blow to the university’s finances and signalling
another escalation in his attack on elite US institutions. 
“We are going to be taking away Harvard’s Tax Exempt Status. It’s what they
deserve!” the US president said in a post on Truth Social on Friday morning. 
The comments from the president deepen a stand-off between Harvard and the
White House, which has also said it will strip more than $2.2bn in federal funding
from the university. Harvard responded last month by suing the Trump
administration.
Harvard University
Harvard said there was “no legal basis to rescind” the university’s tax-exempt
status, adding that the exemption “means that more of every dollar can go toward
scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and
technological advancements that drive economic growth”.
The university added in its statement that the “unprecedented action would
endanger our ability to carry out our educational mission”.
Trump has stepped up his attacks on universities and other US institutions that his
supporters consider too progressive. Earlier on Friday, Trump said he would also
end federal funding for public broadcasters PBS and NPR.
The administration accuses the institutions of bias against Trump and his agenda,
while critics of the president have assailed his crackdown as a widening attack on
free speech.
Trump had already previously threatened to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status.
Removal of tax-exempt status for Harvard could mean the university is no longer
treated as a charity for tax purposes, forcing it to pay federal taxes on its income,
among other impacts. Some donors could also lose the tax benefit of giving money
to the university.
The White House did not immediately provide any details about Trump’s
comments or how and when it would move to end Harvard’s tax exemption. 
Democratic US senators Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren, a former professor
at the university, on Friday co-signed a letter calling on the acting Treasury
inspector general for tax administration to investigate the “alarming” reports that
the Internal Revenue Service could revoke Harvard’s non-profit status.
“It is . . . unconscionable that the IRS would become a weapon of the Trump
Administration to extort its perceived enemies,” they wrote.
The president last week accused leading US universities, including Harvard, of
violating federal laws on large foreign donations.
Alongside depriving some universities of their tax-exempt status, the government
is also considering overhauling the accreditation system that makes universities
eligible for federal funding, including student loans.

The BBVA bid for Sabadell could result in the largest European bank takeover,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,/30/2025,Spain’s antitrust watchdog approves BBVA’s €11bn hostile bid for Sabadell,"Spain’s competition watchdog has approved BBVA’s €11bn hostile bid for rival
lender Sabadell, paving the way for the country’s government to have the final say
on the drawn-out takeover battle.
The CNMC, Spain’s antitrust regulator, said late on Wednesday that it had
authorised the acquisition, but added that BBVA would have to accept several
remedies, including a commitment to maintain branches in certain areas.
The maintenance of branches was one of several commitments that BBVA made
during the investigation in a bid to allay the watchdog’s concerns. The regulator
said the proposals were “adequate, sufficient and proportionate to address the
problems that this merger poses for competition in the affected markets”.
A combination of BBVA and Sabadell, which has Catalan roots, would leapfrog
Santander to create the second-biggest player in Spain’s loan market.
BBVA
The bid, which could result in the largest European bank takeover in years, has
faced fierce opposition from Sabadell’s board and Spain’s Socialist-led government.
Writing in the Financial Times this month, César González-Bueno, Sabadell’s chief
executive, said the “unprecedented opposition in Spain” against the deal was
“rooted in a desire to protect competition and stimulate growth”, arguing that a
merger would hurt local businesses.
Carlos Cuerpo, Spain’s economy minister, previously raised concerns that it would
reduce competition in Spanish banking and create financial stability risks by
leaving the country with just three large banks.
The government will now have 15 days to decide whether it plans to analyse the
bid. If so, it will then have a month to make a decision. While the government
cannot prevent BBVA from acquiring Sabadell shares, it has the power to veto a
legal merger of the two banks.
A takeover by BBVA, which makes most of its money in Mexico, would boost the
lender’s presence in its domestic market. It views Sabadell’s small and mid-sized
client base as the most attractive part of its business.
Sabadell’s board rejected a friendly bid from BBVA last May before the larger bank
returned with a hostile approach on the same terms.
“This authorisation is not final,” CNMC said on Wednesday, adding that Cuerpo
would take a decision “on whether to refer it to the council of ministers, which
may, if appropriate, assess the transaction based on criteria of general interest
other than competition protection”.
BBVA chair Carlos Torres Vila said: “The union with Banco Sabadell is a project of
growth, which will allow us to increase our lending capacity to businesses and
households by an additional €5bn per year.”
He added that the bank’s commitments were focused on “financial inclusion,
territorial cohesion, credit for SMEs and the self-employed, and [preserving]
competitiveness”.
Sabadell criticised CNMC on Wednesday, saying it opposed the methodology used
by the regulator throughout its investigation.
The bank argued that the methodology did not allow for an “accurate assessment of
the impact of the potential consolidation” on small and medium-sized enterprises.",https://www.ft.com/content/d4cfbb78-ddfd-4f8e-a50e-06f565a39b7f
People living in the most deprived areas,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/1/2025,UK agency finds stark inequalities in health protection,"The chances of being admitted to hospital with infectious diseases are dramatically
higher in people of certain ethnicities, from particular geographic areas and those
living in deprivation, according to the first study of its kind by the UK Health
Security Agency.
The agency said inequalities in health protection “have a high human cost” and “a
wider societal impact, including on health services and economic productivity”. 
Among other striking statistics, the report found that emergency hospital
admission rates for tuberculosis were 29 times higher for a group described as
“Asian other” compared with White British people, 27 times higher for Indian
people and 15 times higher for Black African people. 
Health
People living in the 20 per cent most deprived areas in England are almost twice as
likely to be admitted to hospital due to infectious diseases than the least deprived.
Those living in the North West are 30 per cent more likely to be hospitalised for an
infectious disease compared with the English average.
The report, published on Friday, found that people living in areas of high
deprivation typically had “higher levels of air pollution than less deprived and less
ethnically diverse areas” and were more exposed to adverse weather “including
thermally inefficient housing, fuel poverty, a lack of air conditioning and distance
from cooling environmental greenery”.
Dr Leonora Weil, UKHSA deputy director for health equity and inclusion, told a
symposium at the Health Foundation, a research organisation, that health
inequalities “are avoidable, persistent, pervasive and preventable”.
By making the data “visible” the aim was that the UKHSA, working across national
and local government, the NHS and voluntary sectors, “can . . . make those changes
to allow communities to live longer and in better health”, she said.
The UKHSA estimated that, as well as the costs to the social, physical and mental
health of communities, “inequalities in emergency infectious disease hospital
admissions cost the NHS between £970mn and £1.5bn in 2022-23”. Infectious
diseases were the primary reason for more than 20 per cent of hospital bed usage
in England, at an annual cost of almost £6bn in 2023-24, the agency recently
suggested.
The report shows that in deprived communities emergency hospital admission
rates are twice as high for respiratory diseases in general compared with the least
deprived communities, up to seven times higher for TB and six times higher for
measles.
Highlighting one way in which use of data is making a difference, Weil cited
significant measles outbreaks in 2023, particularly in London and in Birmingham.
“We have real-time data flowing on MMR vaccination from GP records” and have
been able to see “very precisely what we have in terms of ethnicity, deprivation
status, where people live”, she added.",https://www.ft.com/content/dc229b9b-3ebe-44e8-b3f0-cf3419f47aa4
Marco Rubio spoke separately with senior officials,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,/30/2025,US urges India and Pakistan to de-escalate tensions,"US secretary of state Marco Rubio urged India and Pakistan to “de-escalate
tensions” after a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir last week,
highlighting Washington’s growing alarm about the frictions between the nuclear-
armed neighbours.
Rubio’s appeal came in separate phone conversations with senior officials in India
and Pakistan on Wednesday as the rising tension in South Asia threatens to
reignite one of the region’s longest-running conflicts after New Delhi linked the
killing of 26 civilians to Islamabad.
India-Pakistan relations
Speaking to Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Rubio urged Pakistani
officials to co-operate in “investigating this unconscionable attack”, the state
department said. “Rubio also encouraged Pakistan to work with India to de-
escalate tensions, re-establish direct communications and maintain peace and
security in South Asia,” it added.
Rubio delivered a similar message to Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam
Jaishankar, saying he “expressed his sorrow” over the attack on tourists in
Pahalgam and committed to “co-operation with India against terrorism”. He
similarly encouraged New Delhi to collaborate with Islamabad, the state
department said.
Rubio’s peacemaking push comes a day after Indian Prime Minister Narendra
Modi said the army had “operational freedom” to respond to the attack. The
Pakistani government claimed early on Wednesday that “credible intelligence”
showed that its neighbour intended to militarily strike by Thursday.
Islamabad has denied any connection to the Pahalgam attack, called for a neutral
investigation and suggested the massacre was a “false flag operation”. It also
accused New Delhi of engineering terrorism in Pakistan’s restive provinces
bordering Afghanistan.
The two sides have downgraded ties since the attack. Pakistan is already fighting a
surge in violence it blames on militants allied with Afghanistan’s Taliban, which is
seeking closer ties to India.
“The international community must remain alive to the reality that the onus of an
escalatory spiral and its ensuing consequences shall squarely lie with India,”
Attaullah Tarar, Pakistan’s information minister, said in an English-language
broadcast shortly after midnight. 
The foreign ministers of China, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia
have also been attempting to ease tensions.

Kashmir, called the Line of Control, for several consecutive days. Pakistan’s Armed
Forces declined to comment on the allegation.",https://www.ft.com/content/3a872cd2-466e-4fc3-a312-87609c22724f
Mercedes-Benz chief Ola Källenius says the impact of tariffs on customers;suppliers;rivals will play out,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,/30/2025,Stellantis says Trump rowback will ease tariff pain,"Stellantis has told investors that Donald Trump’s relief measures for the car
industry are “generous” enough to mostly offset its tariff exposure for US-made
vehicles for this year.
Doug Ostermann, the Jeep and Fiat owner’s chief financial officer, however,
warned that the shift in the US president’s trade policy was “so significant” that it
would require a hard review of its broader manufacturing strategy to protect its
profits.
“As the situation evolves, we will need to calibrate our North American
investments, footprint and employment to ensure the profitability of our
company,” Ostermann said.
The comments on Wednesday came as Stellantis and Mercedes-Benz became the
latest carmakers to pull their guidance due to trade uncertainty.
Automobiles
With the frequent changes in tariff policy, companies have struggled to keep pace,
while profits have fallen sharply during the first quarter even before the full force
of the 25 per cent levies on imports of all foreign-made cars have taken effect.
Ola Källenius, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz, said on Wednesday that “you can
calculate the crude effect of what the tariffs mean mathematically” but their impact
on customers, suppliers and rivals would play out in an “asymmetric way”.
In a speech in Michigan on Tuesday, Trump offered small rebates to carmakers
that produce their vehicles in the US to offset the costs of his broader levies, as well
as an exemption from the administration’s tariffs on steel and aluminium for
imported parts.
Components from Mexico and Canada that are compliant with the rules of the
2020 USMCA trade agreement will remain tariff-free. Non-compliant vehicles will
face a maximum tariff of 25 per cent.
The tariff rebate also allows carmakers that assemble their vehicles in the US to
reclaim up to 3.75 per cent of the retail value of the car for the next year. It will
drop to 2.5 per cent from May 1 2026 and be phased out completely on April 30
2027.
In the case of Stellantis roughly 80 per cent of the US-manufactured vehicles are
compliant with the USMCA.
If the non-compliant portion can be brought to 15 per cent, Ostermann said: “The
3.75 per cent of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price should cover your tariff
exposure for this first year.”
Carmakers could try and mitigate the tariff cost through means including raising
the retail price of vehicles while using incentives to sell them at a lower price to
obtain higher rebates.
On Wednesday, Stellantis also reported that its quarterly revenue fell 14 per cent to
€35.8bn as shipments fell due to lower production of vehicles in the US.
The situation is tougher for German carmakers such as Mercedes-Benz and Audi
that have more vehicles and parts that are not compliant with the USMCA.",https://www.ft.com/content/dc078ea8-13f0-44c4-baa8-67dec62110cd
UN observers,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/2/2025,UN explores radical reforms while bracing for more Trump cuts,"The UN is considering sweeping reforms that would transform the 80-year-old
body as it braces for even deeper funding cuts from the Trump administration.
An internal review ordered in March by António Guterres, the UN secretary-
general, recommends merging large departments to streamline operations and
move staff from high-cost locations such as New York and Geneva.
If implemented, the reforms would be the UN’s deepest overhaul in decades,
consolidating dozens of agencies and programmes into a handful of overarching
departments. They would allow Guterres to argue that the UN is willing to make
big changes ahead of funding talks with the US, its largest donor.
United Nations
One proposal is to combine the World Food Programme (WFP), the Palestinian
relief agency UNRWA and the humanitarian affairs body OCHA into a single
organisation, according to a memo seen by the Financial Times.
The memo also suggested that the UN’s climate change arm be integrated into the
environment programme. It mulled whether the COP climate change summit,
which produced the landmark Paris agreement are attended by tens of thousands
each year, “should be discontinued” in its current form.
Elsewhere, the refugee and migration agencies could be merged, as could UN
Women and the UN Population Fund, which provides reproductive health services.
The reforms would allow Guterres “to go into the meetings and say — ‘Look, the
UN is being proactive and is already creating efficiencies’”, said a person familiar
with discussions around the review, which is called UN80. “What’s better — for the
UN to make these changes now or be forced to make them when the money isn’t
there?”
The UN said in a statement to the FT that the memo “is the preliminary result of an
exercise to generate ideas and thoughts from senior officials on how to achieve the
secretary-general’s vision” of making the UN “more effective and efficient”. The
document was one of three “work streams” it is pursuing, the statement said.
The six-page memo — which was first reported by Reuters — bluntly acknowledges
a core criticism of the UN: that it is bloated by inefficiencies from overlapping
programmes and agencies, and by an expensive expatriate workforce often far from
the regions they serve.
“The progressive proliferation of agencies, funds, and programmes has led to a
fragmented development system, with overlapping mandates, inefficient use of
resources, and inconsistent delivery of services,” the memo says.
The changes would come on top of severe UN cuts already being implemented due
to the White House slashing foreign aid, including more than 80 per cent of
USAID’s budget.
The WFP, which received about half its 2024 budget from the US, could lose
almost a third of its staff. Unicef is bracing for a 20 per cent budget cut, according
to internal memos. OCHA has already laid off 2,600 employees worldwide.",https://www.ft.com/content/01222cf9-c81b-41fa-9d47-51e88e506656

Early on Wednesday, shares in Starbucks fell as much as 11 per cent. That was
down a third from the company’s recent highs in February and below its closing
price a day before Niccol’s arrival was announced last August. The stock closed
down 5.7 per cent.
Niccol was recruited to reverse declining sales after he led a successful turnaround
at Chipotle Mexican Grill. Shares of Starbucks soared by a record 24.5 per cent on
the day he was hired, reflecting Wall Street’s faith in his business acumen.
Starbucks Corp
The US-based group late on Tuesday reported a 2 per cent year-on-year increase in
quarterly revenue to $8.8bn — in line with expectations — but a 50 per cent slide in
net income to $384.2mn. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had predicted quarterly
profits of $551mn.
Niccol acknowledged that the results were disappointing, but said his turnaround
efforts would take time to pay off. “Our financial results don’t yet reflect our
progress, but we have real momentum with our ‘Back to Starbucks’ plan,” he said
in a video message, using the term for his strategy.
He has sought to reduce customers’ wait times, simplify menus and restore the
welcoming coffeehouse feel that was lost as more business moved online during the
Covid-19 pandemic.
As part of his plan, Starbucks intends to spend more on baristas while putting the
expansion of a three-year-old café technology system on ice, as it emphasises
labour over gadgets as a way to bring customers back to stores.
“We’re finding through our work that investments in labour rather than equipment
are more effective at improving throughput and driving transaction growth,” he
told analysts.
He said the company would pause the rollout of parts of the Siren Craft System
that was unveiled in 2022 under former chief executive Howard Schultz.
“Over the last couple of years, we’ve actually been removing labour from the stores,
I think with the hope that equipment could offset the removal of the labour,” Niccol
told analysts. “And I think what we’re finding is that was just — that wasn’t an
accurate assumption with what played out.”
Starbucks has 361,000 employees worldwide, most of them in cafés. Baristas have
complained of being overwhelmed juggling in-store and online orders at the
busiest times of day, while customers have been frustrated by long wait times.
Investment to improve cafés is coming at a cost: Starbucks said store operating
expenses rose 12.1 per cent to $4.2bn in the quarter. The company said additional
labour in support of Niccol’s “Back to Starbucks” strategy was one reason why store
expenses ate into profitability.
Starbucks said it opened 213 net new stores in the second quarter, bringing its total
worldwide to 40,789. Cathy Smith, chief financial officer, said: “While we have
solid new store economics, we have room for improvement and are evaluating our
global store portfolio and new store pipeline.”
Starbucks is facing an increasingly difficult challenge as consumers signal caution
in the face of US President Donald Trump’s trade wars.
Global comparable store sales for the Seattle-based company fell 1 per cent in the
second quarter that ended in March, marking a fifth straight quarter of declines.
US stores reported 4 per cent fewer transactions year on year.
Trump’s baseline tariffs of 10 per cent, which took effect in April, will increase the
cost of coffee beans Starbucks imports to the US from nations including Brazil and
Colombia. 
Starbucks has said wholesale coffee prices — currently trading at record highs of
more than $4 a pound — account for 10 per cent to 15 per cent of its product and
distribution costs.
Schultz, who built the company and has occasionally weighed in on its fortunes,
endorsed the current strategy on Wednesday.",https://www.ft.com/content/fc867e34-ae2a-4f29-874d-4d47d2162869
Shari Redstone;her family are,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,/30/2025,Paramount ready to settle $20bn Trump lawsuit against CBS News,"Paramount is willing to strike a deal to resolve Donald Trump’s $20bn lawsuit
against CBS News, after the studio’s owner, Shari Redstone, grew “concerned”
about the network’s balance in recent months.
Paramount was prepared to settle Trump’s suit, which alleges CBS’s flagship 60
Minutes news programme defamed him by deceptively editing an interview with
his political opponent Kamala Harris last year, said two people familiar with the
matter.
Paramount’s board drew up financial terms for a potential settlement in an April
18 meeting, the people said. The possible settlement could be in the tens of millions
of dollars, said one of the people. Lawyers for both sides were set to begin
mediation on Wednesday.
Paramount Global
CBS’s lawyers have said Trump’s lawsuit is baseless and some of its own journalists
have decried the potential deal as a capitulation to the White House by one of the
country’s best-known news groups.
The openness to a settlement comes after Redstone, the billionaire who controls
Paramount, grew frustrated with the tone of some of CBS’s coverage in recent
months, said a person familiar with her thinking.
“She has been concerned for a while now about the balance of CBS News,” said the
person. Redstone, who has been involved with organisations fighting antisemitism
following Hamas’s October 7 2023 attack on Israel, took issue with CBS’s coverage
of the Israel-Hamas war last year. She raised her criticisms at a conference in
October.
Shari Redstone is set to receive a billion-dollar payout if the Trump administration approves Paramount’s agreed merger with
Although Redstone has recused herself from the Paramount board’s deliberations
over the settlement, she has favoured a deal. “We can’t just be at a standstill, we
have to move something forward,” Redstone told the board, said a person familiar
with the matter.
Redstone and her family are also in line to receive a billion-dollar payout if the
Trump administration approves Paramount’s agreed merger with Hollywood
studio Skydance. The president’s media regulator, Brendan Carr, has been
reviewing the deal for several months.
Redstone was rattled after Trump lashed out at CBS’s 60 Minutes on April 13 after
it broadcast stories about Ukraine and Greenland. She called CBS chief executive
George Cheeks asking what other stories were being prepared, said a person
familiar with the matter.
“She did not ask for edits to stories, all she asked is that they are fair and
balanced,” said a person close to Redstone. “Her thinking was: ‘We’re in the eye of
the storm now. He’s posting about pieces,’” the person added.
Journalists in CBS’s newsroom have taken Redstone’s moves as an example of a
billionaire owner meddling in editorial strategy. Over the past year Amazon
founder Jeff Bezos and pharma billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong have similarly
angered the newsrooms at the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times,
respectively.
60 Minutes’ top producer Bill Owens quit last week in protest at what he said was a
loss of journalistic independence. In an unusual on-air rebuke, 60 Minutes anchor
Scott Pelley ended Sunday’s broadcast by telling viewers Paramount had begun “to
supervise our content in new ways” as it tried to complete a merger.

Paramount’s conundrum underscores the unusual power the US president has
wielded over corporate America.
Carr denies the CBS lawsuit has affected his deliberation over Paramount’s
Skydance deal. But Paramount executives believe the two processes are
intertwined.
The saga has drawn criticism from journalists outside CBS, who say Paramount’s
concession to Trump would do permanent damage to the news organisation.
“In capitulating [Redstone would be] damaging the value of the asset that she’s
trying to sell, by basically telling the world that one of the most storied brands in
news can be silenced, manipulated or humiliated when it’s expedient,” said Gabriel
Kahn, a former Wall Street Journal editor who is now a professor at the University
of Southern California.
60 Minutes has been a fixture of US living rooms since the 1970s and the home to
journalistic legends such as Walter Cronkite. The programme still brings in 7mn
viewers on Sunday evenings. It has continued to air extensive coverage of Trump’s
administration in recent weeks.
“In journalism, the currency is trust,” Kahn said. “CBS News is one of the few
places that still has been able to maintain a high level of trust and strong
reputation [in the US].”
The New York Times previously reported details of Paramount’s plans and the
April board meeting.
Trump last year sued ABC News after anchor George Stephanopoulos falsely said
on-air that Trump had been found “liable for rape”. Disney, which owns ABC, in
December paid $15mn to Trump’s presidential library to settle the defamation
lawsuit.
Trump hit out at CBS again on Wednesday as mediation began.
“The case we have against 60 Minutes, CBS, and Paramount is a true WINNER.
They cheated and defrauded the American People at levels never seen before in the
Political Arena” he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. “CBS is out of
control, at levels never seen before, and they should pay a big price for this. MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

The financial district in Shanghai. Renminbi borrowing by overseas companies in mainland Chinese markets hit $26.5bn,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/1/2025,Foreign companies flock to ‘panda bond’ market in hunt for China hedge,"Multinational companies are flocking to China’s bond market at a record rate as they try to secure
cheaper financing and hedge against deteriorating relations between Beijing and the US.
So-called panda bond issuance — renminbi borrowing by overseas companies in mainland Chinese
markets — hit Rmb194.8bn ($26.5bn) in 2024, the highest level on record for a full year. In the
first quarter of this year it reached Rmb41.6bn, its second-best quarterly issuance since the World
Bank and Asian Development Bank sold the first such bonds in 2005.
Mercedes-Benz, HSBC and Trafigura are among the foreign groups that have driven the wave of
fundraising. Many companies are keen to take advantage of Chinese interest rates that are much
lower than those elsewhere, for instance in the US and Europe.
The issuance marks a shift in strategy by global companies to issue debt for their China
subsidiaries locally, rather than raising funds abroad and then transferring the money to their
Chinese unit. Analysts say this “in China for China” strategy could help foreign groups reduce
transaction costs — or even hedge against potential financial restrictions on their local units if the
US-China trade war escalates.
“Geopolitical uncertainties are adding pressure on global CFOs and treasurers to consider
diversifying the currencies they use for financing, in further boosting the supply of panda bond
issuance,” said Terry Zhang, head of global strategy and business management at CSCI Pengyuan,
a rating agency in China.
Joerg Wuttke, partner at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group and former president of the EU
Chamber of Commerce in China, said issuing debt locally meant Chinese banks held a share of an
international company’s “China risk”.
“European companies do prefer to hold debt on their local country balance sheet,” he added.

“The diversification does not only benefit our Chinese operations, but it also takes off pressure
from our funding levels in the established markets such as euro and USD,” said a Mercedes-Benz
spokesperson.
“We are generally trying to fund in the markets we are active in and support their development . . . 
Especially in times of trade tensions and market volatility, with our panda bonds we are happy to
have access to additional funding sources at attractive rates.”
HSBC directed the Financial Times towards a statement released in November 2024 following a
Rmb4.5bn bond issuance in which the company said the funds would be used to “support
businesses’ growing demand for RMB, and broader RMB internationalisation”.
Trafigura declined to comment.
China’s 10-year sovereign bond yields are close to the record low they hit in January, amid
concerns about the domestic economy falling into a deflationary spiral. That has increased the gap
in borrowing costs with the US, which investment bankers say has made panda bonds an attractive
fundraising route.
The average coupon rate has dropped below 2 per cent in the first quarter of 2025 from 3.4 per
cent in 2022, according to data from provider Wind, which has increased interest in issuing this
form of debt.
“There is to be continued interest from foreign firms to issue panda bonds this year due to low
rates,” said Zhang Xing, debt capital markets head at investment bank China International Capital
Corporation.
The panda bond market remains far smaller than the so-called dim sum bond market — renminbi-
denominated debt issued in Hong Kong and available to international investors.
“Panda bond issuance is something the Chinese government wants to develop generally,” said
Christopher Li, Asia credit trading desk analyst at BNP Paribas, in reference to Beijing’s push to
develop its capital markets and increase usage of the renminbi.
“It gives [foreign] issuers an alternative way of funding [their operations] and does offer investors a
higher yield than local [sovereign and corporate] bonds,” he added.
Some foreign governments are also looking at issuing panda bonds. Hungary said last month it
intended to sell debt in mainland China this year.",https://www.ft.com/content/af4ed068-ef31-45a3-a462-3db25b55ce76
Myles McCormick,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/2/2025,Donald Trump calls for $163bn in cuts to ‘woke’ and ‘wasteful’ federal spending,"Donald Trump has called for $163bn in cuts to federal spending in a sweeping
budget proposal that guts programmes his administration deems “woke”,
“wasteful” or “weaponised against ordinary working Americans”.
In a budget blueprint submitted to Congress on Friday, the US president pressed
for non-defence spending to be slashed by 22.6 per cent to the lowest level since
2017 alongside a sharp increase in the defence budget.
Trump’s plan would slash billions of dollars previously spent on foreign aid,
healthcare, education and the environment, codifying many of the cuts being
implemented by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.
US budget
Russ Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, said current
expenditure was “contrary to the needs of ordinary working Americans and tilted
toward funding niche non-governmental organisations and institutions of higher
education committed to radical gender and climate ideologies antithetical to the
American way of life”.
Trump’s budget wishlist comes as he intensifies his assault on the administrative
state. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, and Doge are leading the radical effort
to shrink the size of the federal government.
But many of the measures will face an uphill battle in Congress, where Trump’s
Republican party holds a slim majority in the Senate and House of
Representatives.
While House Speaker Mike Johnson praised Trump’s “bold blueprint”, Susan
Collins, chair of the powerful Senate appropriations committee, said she had
“serious objections” to some elements.
Friday’s proposal outlines the president’s priorities for ‘discretionary’ spending, the
portion of the federal budget set by appropriations bills in Congress each year. It
does not include longer-term ‘mandatory’ spending such as Social Security,
Medicare, and interest paid on the federal debt.
Foreign aid would be hit particularly hard under Trump’s proposal, with a $49bn
cut in spending and the shuttering of USAID, which Doge has reduced to a skeleton
operation.
The budget takes aim at what the administration dubbed the “globalist climate
agenda”, cutting grants for renewable energy and electric vehicles.
It also slashes spending on the education department, which Trump has vowed to
close. The plan takes an axe to funding for agencies including the National
Institutes of Health, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Internal
Revenue Service, all of which he said have been “weaponised”.
Contrasting the spending cuts, the plan calls for an increase in government outlay
on the military and border security as part of Trump’s pledge to clamp down on
illegal immigration. The defence budget would rise 13 per cent, while homeland
security would be allocated another 65 per cent.",https://www.ft.com/content/f4a8d03d-911c-4dca-8d6c-be42541ba8e2
Ambulances;police cars at Atocha station,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,/30/2025,Spain’s PM Pedro Sánchez under fire as country reels from power cut,"Spain’s opposition demanded on Wednesday that Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez
appear before parliament to explain the causes of this week’s catastrophic
electricity blackout, as political recriminations mount over one of Europe’s biggest-
ever power outages.
Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the centre-right Partido Popular opposition party,
has accused the socialist government of an “information blackout”, as he insisted
the prime minister release more details about the events leading to Monday’s
power cut.
Other opposition politicians have attacked Spain’s high reliance on renewables
sources such as solar and wind. Santiago Abascal, leader of the far-right Vox party,
demanded earlier this week that the country abandon “climate fanaticism”.
Spanish politics
Sánchez has called on private electricity providers to assist in the investigation into
the origins of the outage, as more deaths are linked to the electricity system’s
collapse. A committee of officials from different ministries will meet on Wednesday
afternoon to analyse data from private operators.
Three people died in northern Spain after apparent carbon monoxide poisoning
linked to a generator they were using during Monday’s outage. The Spanish Civil
Guard confirmed the deaths, after firefighters detected high levels of the toxic gas
in the family’s home. Local media reported that the family had been using the
generator to power a respirator for one of the victims.
A woman was also found dead in Madrid in what seemed to be a fire caused by a
candle, according to national police.
Investigators are continuing to assess what caused Spain to lose 15 gigawatts of
electricity — some 60 per cent of its supply — in five seconds on Monday.

According to analysts, the frequency on Spain’s electricity grid — the rate at which
electrical current alternates — dropped suddenly at 12:33 local time that day,
triggering many power stations to switch off. The country’s grid operator, Red
Eléctrica, was not able to order enough additional power to come online to avoid
the outage.",https://www.ft.com/content/19ff4856-325c-41f0-bdde-045f128b8ece

holdings of US Treasuries as a “card” in its trade negotiations with the Trump
administration, in a rare baring of teeth by America’s closest ally in Asia.

whether Japan would use its traditional stance as a non-seller of Treasuries as a
tool in trade talks with Washington.

a different decision”.

Finance minister Katsunobu Kato hints that country’s more than $1tn in Treasuries gives it leverage in
negotiations
Japanese holders, including the government, own $1.13tn of Treasuries, the largest
hoard held by a foreign nation.
There is no suggestion that Tokyo is considering any sales of official Treasury
holdings. But traders said that even the reference to such an action as a “card”
could add to volatility in a US bond market that has lurched violently since April 2
when Donald Trump announced sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on US trade
partners. Treasuries were swept up in a wholesale sell-off of American assets
before recovering part of their losses after Trump paused the tariffs for 90 days.
Analysts said that Kato’s comments were a natural reaction to the economic threat
posed by Trump’s trade war, one that Japan’s prime minister has described as a
“national crisis”.
“This is a street fight: promising not to use one of your strongest, most brutal
weapons would be both naive and reckless,” said Nicholas Smith, chief Japan
strategist at CLSA. “You don’t need to use the weapon: just brandish it.”
Japan’s status as the biggest foreign holder in the Treasury market could become
even stronger as a negotiating tool if China decides to weaponise its own Treasury
holdings in its trade confrontation with the US.
Kato’s comments, which break with a long habit of extreme caution on the subject,
emerged just hours after the latest round of talks in Washington between Japan’s
chief negotiator Ryosei Akazawa and his counterparts in the Trump
administration, including Treasury secretary Scott Bessent.
Talks are now expected to intensify in May, with Akazawa indicating that a trade
deal may be possible in June. Diplomatic sources said that the meeting had
included discussion of lowering supposed non-tariff barriers to imports of US cars,
as well as measures Japan might take to reduce its large trade surplus with the US
by expanding purchases of energy and agricultural products.
“The fact that the usually extremely guarded and diplomatic finance minister spoke
up on national TV about what is arguably Japan’s biggest asset in dealing with
America confirms the growing confidence of Japan’s elite in their dealings with the
US,” said Jesper Koll, a director at the online brokerage Monex Group.
Kato has been directly involved in the negotiations with the US and held bilateral
talks with Bessent in the last week of April. The finance minister emerged from
that meeting without offering details on specific demands from the US side.",https://www.ft.com/content/912f861f-26c8-4bcd-aca0-75a09e5767cc

consumers, as the Chinese ecommerce company overhauls its business model in
response to the Trump administration’s tariffs.
US-China trade dispute
Sales on Temu’s US marketplace — which sells households goods ranging from
phone chargers to silicone toilet brushes — will now all be fulfilled from US-based
sellers, rather than Chinese sellers, it said on Friday.
The company, which has been building a network of sellers in the US for more than
a year, added that it was actively recruiting more merchants in the country.
However, the decision to move away from Chinese sellers means its US business
could shrink significantly as a result.
The changes have been made as the US scraps its “de minimis” customs rules,
which exempted inbound parcels worth less than $800 from import duty.
From Friday, low-value shipments from China and Hong Kong will be subject to a
120 per cent tariff or a flat $100 fee, depending on how goods are delivered. The
$100 fee will be doubled from June 1.
The sudden changes are posing major challenges to Temu and its rival Shein,
which sells mostly cheap clothes. Both retailers exploited the “de minimis”
exemption to undercut US retailers with cheap Chinese-made goods shipped
directly to consumers.
The Financial Times reported this week that Shein is exploring whether to shift
production for its US business out of China and that its long-awaited London stock
market float was likely to be delayed further by the tariff changes. The fast-fashion
retailer’s US business accounts for about a third of its $38bn in revenue.",https://www.ft.com/content/d36b6be9-dc75-4d55-b9e3-1ec151252dd4
Martha Muir,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,/30/2025,"Trump energy plan has caused 20,000 US job losses, says climate group","The Trump administration’s cuts to the clean energy industry have led to 20,000
job losses in the US and threatened almost $70bn in project investments,
according to a climate advocacy group.
Climate Power warned that almost 100 projects had been cancelled, delayed or
threatened since the November presidential election, potentially reversing gains in
manufacturing employment under the Biden administration.
A further 40,000 clean energy jobs are under threat, as they are attached to paused
projects or linked to companies that were previously awarded federal grants or
loans that the Trump administration now wants to cut.   
Climate change
The realised and potential job losses are spread across the solar, wind, hydrogen,
critical minerals and battery manufacturing industries — with the already cancelled
or threatened projects representing more than $71.24bn of investment. Arizona,
Nevada, Michigan and Georgia are among the states facing the biggest impact from
potential job losses.
Democrats seized on the new figures, with Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat from
Georgia, saying they were part of a “haemorrhaging” of clean energy jobs and
“catastrophic” for growth.
The US Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.
The data arrives amid growing concern about a weakening US economy, which
contracted over the first quarter due mainly to the impact of tariffs.
Climate Power helped fund a $55mn ad campaign in swing states in support of
Democratic candidate Kamala Harris leading up to the November election. The
majority of clean energy projects announced since former president Joe Biden
passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 are located in Republican congressional
districts, worth just under $200bn. 
Most clean energy projects are funded by IRA tax credits, and Republicans are
debating whether to cut them from the budget.
Since President Donald Trump’s second term began in January, the Department of
the Interior has ordered the cancellation of high-profile projects such as Empire
Wind, leading to the loss of 1,000 jobs, issued a series of executive orders clawing
back clean energy loans distributed under the IRA and has frozen permitting for
projects on federal land. 
In February, Kore Power abandoned plans for a $1bn battery plant in Buckeye,
Arizona’s second-largest city by area, for which it secured a $850mn loan from the
Department of Energy in 2023. 
In the first quarter of 2025, clean energy job creation also declined for the first
quarter since the summer of 2022, with jobs falling from 406,000 at the end of
2024 to 399,000 by the end March.

Leo Lewis,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/1/2025,Bank of Japan slashes growth forecasts on tariff fears,"The Bank of Japan has slashed its economic growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026,
blaming “extremely high uncertainties” over trade, in a move that raises doubts
about future interest rate rises.
Japan’s central bank released a quarterly update to its forecasts alongside a
unanimous decision by its policy board to keep the overnight call rate at “around
0.5 per cent”.
The BoJ cut its forecast for GDP growth in 2025 from 1.1 per cent to 0.5 per cent
and its forecast for 2026 from 1 per cent to 0.7 per cent. It also projected inflation
would fall below its 2 per cent objective to 1.7 per cent in 2026.
At a press conference on Thursday, BoJ governor Kazuo Ueda blamed higher tariffs
for the downgrade and warned of a period in which both inflation and wage growth
might slow.
Japanese economy
Under Ueda, the BoJ has been on a path towards “normalisation” of its ultra-easy
monetary policy, and the downgrades show how Donald Trump’s tariffs could
throw that process off course.
“There are extremely high uncertainties regarding the future course of trade and
other policies in each jurisdiction and the impact of these policies on economic
activity and prices at home and abroad,” said the BoJ in its outlook report.
Ueda said the BoJ’s forecasts assumed that trade negotiations would “progress to
some extent” and significant disruption to supply chains would be avoided. But he
said further revisions to the outlook were a possibility and the likelihood of the
BoJ’s baseline scenario being achieved was no longer very high.
The committee’s two-day meeting was the BoJ’s first since Trump unveiled his
“reciprocal” tariffs in early April.
The policy meeting comes as Japan’s trade negotiators are in Washington for their
latest round of talks aimed at convincing the Trump administration to limit their
tariff threats. Even when the tariffs are finalised, Ueda told the press conference,
uncertainties surrounding their impact on the economy would remain high.
Asked about the impact that tariffs would have on prices, Ueda said inflation would
stagnate for some time, before rising again.
As the turmoil from the proposed duties deepens and efforts to strike a deal with
Washington become more fraught, economists have viewed it as less likely that the
BoJ can stay on its path to “normalisation”.

“But have we really passed through the peak tariff impact? I think we are far, far away from that,”
he added, suggesting that equities could fall again if Trump’s 90-day tariff pause, set to end in July,
did not result in trade deals that significantly lower the levies.

Chris Kay;Andrea Rodrigues in Surat;Krishn Kaushik,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/1/2025,Trump tariffs cut deep into India’s diamond industry,"Seated before a pile of rough diamonds laid out on a faded velvet tray, Kalpesh
Mangukiya said his cutting and polishing business in the Indian city of Surat was
struggling even before Donald Trump’s trade war deepened his woes.
The owner of Kushal Gems had already been forced to lay off a quarter of his staff
as revenue more than halved due in part to western sanctions on Russian
diamonds. Ebbing demand from the US and China, the world’s biggest diamond
markets, amid competition from cheaper lab-grown gems has been a further
complication.
Indian business & finance
Now Trump’s blanket 10 per cent tariff on imports, and a potential for an
additional levy on India, which processes 90 per cent of the world’s diamonds,
threaten greater turmoil — unless a deal can be struck between New Delhi and
Washington.
“The tariffs will affect us . . . demand will come down,” Mangukiya said in his office,
as TV monitors streamed footage from the cramped workshops next door, where
about 100 employees hunched over abrasive polishing wheels in the sweltering
pre-monsoon heat.
“I don’t think things will improve much in the coming months,” he added. “It’s not
fun doing business.”
Many artisans have lost their jobs in the past 12 months and more than 60 have died by suicide as they struggled with mounting
The gloomy outlook reflects the deep crisis in India’s vast diamond processing
industry — one of the country’s top export sectors, along with electronics and
pharmaceuticals — which employs more than 1mn people.
Much of it is based in Surat, a riverside city in Gujarat state that became a hub for
the gem merchants who fled Burma — now Myanmar — after the Japanese
invasion during the second world war.
Exports of cut and polished diamonds, which account for almost half of India’s
gem and jewellery shipments, have fallen 17 per cent on an annual basis to just
over $13bn in the year to March, according to the government-backed Gems and
Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC).
More widely, diamond traders have warned that the global $82bn industry has
ground to a halt due to Trump’s policies, with shipments through the gem-trading
centre of Antwerp down to about one-seventh of usual levels.
The tariffs from the US, destination for about a third of Indian processed
diamonds, are “one more blow to the sector”, said Ujjwal Patel, associate director
at Indian ratings and analytics group CareEdge.
While the precise impact of tariffs on the industry was “not clear”, the uncertainty
had been sufficient to paralyse the Indian trade, he added.
Processors and intermediaries in Surat are struggling to move through their large
built-up inventories.
“There’s [been] no stability for the last year,” said diamond trader Nirav Davda, as
his uncle next to him, who has been in the business for 40 years, examined a pile of
glittering stones through a magnifying loupe. “We’re waiting and watching — we’re
not taking any new orders.”
The downturn has had a deep social and economic impact on Surat, the second-
biggest city in a western state that is the political stronghold of Prime Minister
Narendra Modi.
An estimated 50,000 artisans have lost their jobs in the past 12 months and more
than 60 have died by suicide as many struggled with mounting debts, according to
the Diamond Worker Union Gujarat.
“Our industry is suffering,” said Bhavesh Tank, the union’s vice-president, who
showed the Financial Times a photograph of a young family who had taken their
own lives days earlier by jumping from a bridge. “There was already such a big
problem when there was no tariff.”
India, the world’s most populous nation, is a largely domestically driven economy
that is less export-dependent than many of its Asian peers. Yet Modi, who was
among the first foreign leaders to visit the US president in Washington following
his return to office, has acted with haste to placate the Trump administration.
On a visit to India last month, US vice-president JD Vance had warm words for
Modi and the relations between the two countries, praising what he called “very
good progress” on a potential trade deal, the first part of which they were looking
to sign later this year.
“The next three to six months are, I think, important to see how the whole tariff
situation evolves,” said Shaunak Parikh, GJEPC vice-chair. “Post that I believe we
should get some stability,” he added.
India’s government had been “working very hard”, he continued. “We’re quite
hopeful.”
On the floor of Kushal Gems’ sweaty workshop, many of the workers said they
knew of colleagues who had lost their jobs.
But largely they kept their heads down, with few paying much attention to the
global turmoil caused by Trump’s executive orders.
“We’re not aware of any tariff,” said 46-year-old Kazabhai Mana, who has been
polishing stones since he was a teenager. “We just do our work, God will provide.”
Yet many in the upper echelons of India’s diamond industry have belatedly come to
realise the risks of being dependent on the US, according to Amit Korat, vice-
president of the Surat Jewellery Manufacturers’ Association.",https://www.ft.com/content/3d1d1c8c-8b5f-42b5-9b36-e3cb9ab67f0b
Apollo’s ‘hybrid value’ funds;launched six years ago;gained 3.8%,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/2/2025,Apollo ramps up debt investing amid ‘liberation day’ market turmoil,"Apollo Global has invested $25bn of fresh capital since US President Donald
Trump’s “liberation day” trade war caused corporate bond spreads to widen, taking
advantage of the opportunity to invest at higher returns.
The private capital group told shareholders on Friday it had raised significant cash
in anticipation of market disruption from Trump’s trade wars. It then quickly
invested, mostly in public debt markets, after markets fell in the days following
Trump’s announcement on so-called reciprocal tariffs at the beginning of April.
“We believe we are one of the largest active buyers of assets post-liberation day,”
Marc Rowan, chief executive of Apollo, told shareholders on a conference call.
“Public markets were the fastest to adjust from a price point of view and exhibited
what we expect to see going forward: limited liquidity.”
Apollo Global Management LLC
Jim Zelter, president of the group that manages $785bn in assets, noted that the
“current administration was clear on their objectives pre- and post-election . . . At
Apollo, we’ve been preparing for this environment . . . in anticipation of this market
disruption.”
Apollo’s move to take advantage of market turmoil hit the spread-based earnings in
its Athene insurance business in the first quarter of the year. That caused Apollo
shares to drop nearly 3 per cent in early Friday trading.
The private capital group raised most of the cash for its investments through the
unit, by issuing deposit-like contracts from Athene called “funding agreements”.
“What we chose to do was to massively increase our use of funding agreements . . .
to pile up cash,” said Rowan on the conference call.
Those contracts, considered “inflows” to Athene, are ultimately borrowings that
must be repaid. But Apollo has bet that the unit can earn more than the borrowing
cost through its debt investing.
The spread income Apollo earned from managing insurance assets was $804mn,
slightly short of forecasts from analysts polled by Bloomberg. Apollo said the
decision to raise more cash had shaved about $20mn off its spread-based earnings.
But Apollo still reported a record $559mn in fee-related earnings in the first
quarter of the year, surpassing analyst forecasts, boosted by the launch of new
credit and hybrid equity funds in its assets management unit.
The New York-based group generated its best returns from a strategy designed to
refinance stretched buyout deals or help public companies in need of cash to shore
up their finances.
Apollo’s “hybrid value” funds, launched six years ago, gained 3.8 per cent in the
first quarter and 19.3 per cent over the past 12 months, making them the highest-
returning strategy inside of Apollo.
The returns are nearly triple what Apollo has earned from its flagship buyout
funds, which gained just 6.6 per cent over the past 12 months. Apollo’s credit
funds, which account for the vast majority of its assets, earned between 7.7 per cent
and 11.8 per cent over the past year.",https://www.ft.com/content/2e0d261b-19f5-4cdd-9a1e-3a008a9393a7
Sylvia Pfeifer,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,/30/2025,Airbus chief warns there will be ‘only losers’ from prolonged trade war,"There will be “only losers” in aerospace from a prolonged trade war, especially in
the US, the head of Airbus has warned, as he called for a return of tariff-free
trading for the industry. 
Guillaume Faury, chief executive of the European plane maker, said the industry in
the US was trying to “make the case” for bringing back a 1979 agreement that until
the recent trade disruption allowed for tariff-free trading of aircraft and parts. 
“We believe that makes a lot of sense,” Faury said, adding that it appeared “that
there will be only losers in the aerospace industry, in particular in the US”. 
His comments came as Airbus reported better than expected earnings and
revenues for the first quarter.
Airbus SE
The company, the world’s biggest plane maker, also confirmed its financial targets
and reiterated plans to deliver 820 commercial aircraft this year, but said its
guidance excluded any impact from the tariffs because it was too early to quantify.
Deliveries this year would also be backloaded, “reflecting the specific supply chain
challenges we are facing”, Airbus said. 
Donald Trump’s trade war has created uncertainty in a sector that has largely
operated without trade barriers apart from an 18-month period when levies were
imposed as part of a dispute over subsidies for Boeing and Airbus.
After unveiling a series of tariffs on goods imported from its trading partners in
early April, Trump paused on some of the toughest measures announced for 90
days. However, imports to the US are still subject to a 10 per cent tariff and the
president has ignited a trade war with Beijing by raising levies on most Chinese
goods to as much as 145 per cent.
Faury said Airbus was in talks with US airline customers about how to mitigate the
impact of the 10 per cent duties but stressed that it would not pay tariffs “when it
comes to planes that are going to US customers from outside the US”. 
“It is their duty to do this. They are not very happy to see this situation,” he added. 
Several airline executives, including Ed Bastian of Delta Air Lines, have in recent
weeks warned they would defer deliveries from Airbus or Boeing rather than pay
tariffs. Delta is scheduled to receive 10 wide-body jets from Airbus’s European
factories this year, according to aviation consultancy Cirium.
Aengus Kelly, chief executive of AerCap, the world’s largest aircraft leasing
company, echoed Faury’s comments in an earlier interview with the Financial
Times. Kelly warned that “if this tariff situation is to continue and the Europeans
will be forced to put tariffs on Boeing aircraft . . . it will be far more challenging for
Boeing to sell into Europe and China”.
Airbus, which finalised an agreement on Monday to take over some facilities of
Spirit AeroSystems, said the supplier’s difficulties were continuing to put pressure

Christian Davies,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/1/2025,South Korea turmoil deepens as acting leader and replacement both resign,"South Korea’s political turmoil has deepened after the fiercely divided nation’s
interim leader and the man who was supposed to replace him both resigned within
hours of each other.
Prime Minister Han Duck-soo announced his resignation as acting president on
Thursday afternoon in order to stand for election to succeed conservative president
Yoon Suk Yeol, who was removed last month over his failed attempt to impose
martial law last year.
Choi Sang-mok, South Korea’s finance minister, was supposed to take over as
acting president from Han, but in a shock move himself resigned on Thursday
evening after the opposition-controlled parliament launched fresh impeachment
proceedings against him.
South Korea politics & policy
Education minister and deputy prime minister Lee Ju-ho took over instead as
acting president from midnight on Thursday.
The moves threw Asia’s fourth-largest economy into further political uncertainty.
Han, a career technocrat who has never held elected office, had been expected to
steer South Korea through to a presidential election on June 3.
He had been overseeing trade talks with the US, following tariffs enacted by
President Donald Trump that have hit South Korea’s export-oriented economy. But
he stood down to prepare to stand for president himself, according to people
familiar with his thinking.
Lee became the fourth person to act as South Korea’s head of state since December.
Choi had already served as interim leader for several months this year after the
leftwing-controlled parliament impeached Han over his refusal to fill several spots
on the country’s Constitutional Court.
Han told reporters on Thursday that rather than “completing the heavy
responsibility that I handle now”, he was resigning in order to “take on an even
heavier responsibility”. He is expected to launch his candidacy on Friday.
Choi, in a brief statement to reporters, said: “I apologise to the people for having to
resign as I cannot continue to perform my duties amid severe domestic and
international economic conditions.”
The resignations came amid growing fears among South Korean conservatives that
none of the prospective candidates from Yoon’s People Power party appear capable
of mounting a credible challenge to leftwing frontrunner Lee Jae-myung.
Lee was the preferred candidate of 48.5 per cent of respondents to a Realmeter
survey released this week. The most popular PPP candidate garnered the support
of 13.4 per cent of respondents. Han was not included in the poll.
“Even when Han announces his candidacy, this election will still very much be
Lee’s to lose,” said Erik Mobrand, a political scientist at Seoul National University.
Han said on Thursday that South Korea “cannot protect our core interests with
irrational, poll-driven economic strategies”, in a thinly veiled reference to Lee’s
reputation among critics for economic populism.",https://www.ft.com/content/ae3bf1d5-8650-4091-8075-05c91a908f36
George Parker in London;Andy Bounds,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,/30/2025,Keir Starmer resists pressure to give MPs a vote on any US-UK trade deal,"Sir Keir Starmer on Wednesday resisted growing pressure to guarantee UK MPs a
vote on a trade deal with Donald Trump, as officials in London insisted the pact
could be agreed before a sensitive EU summit.
Allies of Starmer said he would like to seal a deal with Trump before the prime
minister sits down with EU leaders on May 19, anxious that the London summit
may antagonise the US president.
Some senior British officials say it is possible that Britain could conclude a trio of
trade deals with the US, EU and India in the next three weeks. “That’s the dream
scenario,” said one, but they admitted uncertainties remained over the accords
with Washington and New Delhi.
UK trade
Some MPs are concerned that Starmer could sign a substandard or rushed deal
with Trump ahead of the EU summit and want him to honour a commitment, given
when Labour was in opposition in 2021, to let them debate and vote on trade deals.
But at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Starmer said the government
would “act in the national interest” but that if a deal was secured “it would go
through the known procedures for this House”.
Unlike legislation, trade deals are made by governments using “prerogative
powers”. Parliament cannot amend treaties, including trade deals, and debates and
votes on treaties remain largely at the discretion of ministers.
A briefing note by the House of Commons library says that while MPs can
indefinitely delay the ratification of a treaty, the process is unwieldy and the
Commons has “never used this power”.
Liam Byrne and Emily Thornberry, Labour chairs of the Commons business and
foreign affairs committees respectively, have demanded MPs have a vote, as has Sir
Ed Davey, Liberal Democrat leader.
Byrne said: “When it comes to trade deals, ministers must be free to negotiate, but
parliament must be free to judge. We are debating in the dark with no knowledge
of the mandate for US talks, no clarity on the red lines, and no say on the trade-
offs.”
Landing three trade deals would represent a big economic coup for Starmer,
although the diplomacy of negotiating closer ties with the EU — a bloc that Trump
claimed was set up to “screw” America — alongside a deal with Washington is
challenging.
The latest draft of the EU/UK summit communiqué, seen by the FT, will not play
well in the White House. It says both sides share a “commitment to free and open
trade”, have a “commitment to multilateralism” and will support Ukraine against
“Russian aggression”.
The joint statement confirms Britain is much more closely aligned with Europe
than the White House, talking about working with “like-minded partners” to
“mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the global economic order”.",https://www.ft.com/content/faea56e7-9b8c-4d69-96db-b6ffd890597e
Henry Foy;Gideon Rachman,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,/30/2025,EU readies ‘plan B’ should Donald Trump walk away from Ukraine talks,"The EU is preparing a “plan B” on how to keep economic sanctions against Russia
should the Trump administration abandon Ukraine peace talks and seek
rapprochement with Moscow, according to the bloc’s top diplomat.
US President Donald Trump had vowed to bring a swift end to Russia’s more than
three-year-long war against Ukraine, but has failed to force a peace agreement
during his first 100 days in office, as Moscow and Kyiv both reject elements of his
administration’s proposals.
“It’s a question whether the Americans will want to leave,” Kaja Kallas, the EU’s
high representative for foreign and security policy, told the Financial Times. “We
see signs that they are contemplating whether they should leave Ukraine and not
try to get a deal with the Russians because it’s hard.”
EU foreign policy
A spokesperson for US secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Tuesday: “If there is
not progress, we will step back as mediators in this process.”
Trump’s suggestions for economic rapprochement with Moscow as part of a peace
deal have fuelled concerns that some EU countries will demand that Brussels also
moves to lift EU sanctions against Russia in the coming months.
European officials are also worried about the consequences of the US potentially
allowing its companies to restart economic co-operation with Russia while EU
businesses are still barred from doing so.
Kallas said there was a “plan B” to maintain economic pressure on Russia should
Hungary block the rollover of EU economic sanctions in July, but stressed that
Brussels was still focused on keeping all member states aligned.
“There is also a plan B, but we have to work for plan A, because otherwise you
concentrate on plan B and then that will happen,” she said, adding that talks were
continuing with Washington and other international partners to ensure that the
western sanctions regime was kept in place.
The FT has previously reported that one option is for national governments to
adopt the sanctions individually to circumvent a Hungarian veto, such as Belgium
issuing a royal decree to keep €190bn worth of Russian state assets frozen on
Belgian soil.
“Belgium will not do something nationally,” a senior Belgian official told the FT.
Pavlishak/Reuters
But Kallas did acknowledge that there are discussions in some EU capitals on
whether to follow the Trump administration if it abandons Ukraine and resets
relations with Russia.
“It is clear that these types of discussions are going on in certain member states
and maybe hopes that we don’t really have to support [Ukraine] any more,” said
Kallas, the former Estonian prime minister. “But it’s also a false hope, because if
you look at Russia, that is investing more than 9 per cent of its GDP on the
military, they will want to use it again.”
As part of its peace proposals, the US has offered to lift sanctions against Moscow
— imposed in conjunction with the EU — and restart economic co-operation with
Russia in sectors including energy. Hungary has threatened to veto a vote at the
end of July that would need to be unanimous to extend the EU’s sanctions regime.
Kallas said Europe could step in financially to help Ukraine in the case of a US
withdrawal, but acknowledged that “in terms of military support, of course it’s
harder to fill the gap if the Americans are leaving”.
She said Brussels and other European capitals were focused on “still working with
the Americans and trying to convince them why the outcome of this war is also in
their interest, that Russia doesn’t really get everything that it wants”.",https://www.ft.com/content/1f4ba00b-9e90-4c9b-be6b-e57efaf1e9d5
Heba Saleh in Cairo;Mai Khaled,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/1/2025,Prices in Gaza soar as supplies run out under Israeli siege,"Food prices have soared in Gaza as supplies run out nearly two months after Israel
imposed a suffocating siege on the enclave, blocking the entry of all humanitarian
and commercial goods.
Dwindling stocks and rising prices of essentials have contributed to the
catastrophic conditions inside the enclave, with most of the 2.2mn population
living in makeshift shelters or in the rubble of their bombed homes.
“Every day, there is less variety on offer and food costs more,” said Abdel Karim
Mesbah, a market vendor. “We will die of hunger if they don’t open the crossings
and allow aid to enter.”
He said he recently spent Shk20 ($5.50) — an entire day’s earnings — on half a
kilogramme of potatoes because his three children had been yearning for french
fries.
Israel-Hamas war
“Their joy as I watched them eat and ask for more made me weep,” said Mesbah,
who lives with his family in a tent in Jabalia in north Gaza.
Food and other aid into the enclave surged during the initial weeks of a ceasefire
that started in January, helping to ease the dire humanitarian conditions inside.
But since Israel reimposed a blockade and broke the ceasefire last month, prices
have shot higher and supplies run low.
Prices for a kilogramme of lemons and sugar in northern Gaza have doubled since
April 3 to Shk60 and Shk70, respectively, according to a survey by non-profit
Christian Aid. A pack of nappies in southern Gaza more than doubled to Shk180,
while cabbage could no longer be found at all.
Locals told the Financial Times that meat, chicken and eggs had all but
disappeared.
The World Food Programme said last week that it had run out of food stocks
altogether, with all 25 bakeries supplied with flour and fuel by the UN agency
forced to close down.
“Food prices have skyrocketed up to 1,400 per cent compared to during the
ceasefire, and essential food commodities are in short supply, raising serious
nutrition concerns for vulnerable populations,” said the WFP.

Israeli officials have justified the blockade as necessary to pressure Hamas
militants to return the remaining 59 hostages — fewer than half of whom are still
believed to be alive — seized during their October 7 2023 attack.
Rights groups have condemned Israel’s siege as a starvation tactic.
“I don’t eat much of the time to leave food for the children because they get hungry
during the night,” said Reem al-Shanty, a mother of four in Gaza City.
For months, she added, the family had lived on rice, lentils, bread and beans, but
on Friday they decided to eat vegetables because their “bodies were tired of pulses
and dry food”.
Her husband bought two courgettes, an aubergine, two tomatoes, a green pepper
and an onion for Shk80.
“My children dream of their favourite meals and it breaks my heart that we can
hardly get anything for them,” she said.
Before the war, the coastal enclave was known for its fish, along with popular
Palestinian dishes such as maqluba, a dish of layered rice, fried vegetables and
chicken that is cooked in a pot and flipped after cooking.
Some Gazans say that throughout the war they have been making “fake maqluba”
without the chicken. Aid agencies also say fishermen no longer go to sea because of
the risk of Israeli attacks.
UN officials on Thursday criticised what they said were unacceptable Israeli
proposals to start allowing some aid into Gaza that would fail to meet
humanitarian standards.
Juliette Touma, from UNRWA, the biggest UN agency in the enclave, said on
Thursday that Israel briefed agencies on a proposal “that would introduce greater
control over aid delivery in Gaza by Israeli forces, including by controlling how
goods are received and distributed”.
“Humanitarian organisations already have mechanisms in place to ensure that aid
is not diverted,” she said. “Further control over aid operations by a party to the
conflict would risk aid not reaching the most vulnerable at a time when it is needed
the most.”
Tom Fletcher, the UN humanitarian relief chief, added that Israel’s blockade was
against humanitarian law and that Israeli proposals did “not meet the minimum
bar for principled humanitarian support”.
Rafeek al-Madhoun, a programme manager for US aid group Rebuilding Alliance,
which has been running hot food kitchens providing daily meals, said it had cut
down to supplying 40,000 people instead of 70,000 — and would have to stop
completely by the end of the week.
“We need rice, lentils and pasta but there is nothing on the market,” he said. “We
will be seeing the signs of hunger by the end of the week.”
Even Palestinians who receive good salaries or transfers from relatives abroad find
it hard to buy food because of the lack of liquidity, with banks and cash machines
destroyed and no bank notes entering the territory.",https://www.ft.com/content/89cc60b5-ae7e-4e7e-a31c-c7c5f0404ee6
Demetri Sevastopulo;James Politi,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/1/2025,Donald Trump sacks national security adviser Mike Waltz,"Donald Trump has tapped secretary of state Marco Rubio to be interim national
security adviser after firing Mike Waltz and his deputy following a scandal over the
use of a private messaging app to discuss military plans.
Trump announced the move on Truth Social on Thursday afternoon, saying Waltz
would be nominated to serve as US ambassador to the UN, keeping a prominent
role in the administration’s foreign policy team.
“Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation’s Interests first. I know he will do
the same in his new role. In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve
as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State
Department,” Trump wrote. “Together, we will continue to fight tirelessly to Make
America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN.”
Alex Wong, deputy national security adviser, was expected to leave his post on
Thursday alongside Waltz, said two people with knowledge of the situation.
Mike Waltz
Their ousting comes one month after Trump fired several National Security
Council officials after Laura Loomer, a far-right activist, told him they were not
sufficiently aligned with his “Make America Great Again” movement.
Waltz’s tenure became precarious after he accidentally included the editor of The
Atlantic magazine in a Signal chat with top officials in which they discussed details
of looming US strikes in Yemen targeting Houthi rebels.
The furore over what became known as “Signalgate” has cast a cloud over Trump’s
entire national security team, and has enveloped defence secretary Pete Hegseth,
who shared sensitive information about the military operation on the chat and
separately with family members.
While Waltz came under pressure over Signalgate, several people familiar with the
situation said the Maga movement had taken aim at the former Army Green Beret
and Florida congressman long before the Signal scandal broke.
People close to Trump viewed Waltz, a foreign policy hawk, as a “neoconservative”
who was more willing to use US power abroad than the president, who says he is
against starting wars overseas.
Loomer raised concerns about Waltz in a meeting with Trump last month that the
national security adviser attended. She also attacked Wong on social media, and
had also taken aim at Ivan Kanapathy, a former fighter pilot who serves as the top
China official in the NSC.
Loomer appeared to take credit for the dismissals, writing “SCALP” on social
media site X on Thursday.
“Hopefully, the rest of the people who were set to be fired but were given
promotions at the NSC under Waltz also depart,” she added.
In another post, she wrote: “FIRE IVAN KANAPATHY!!!!!!”.
Waltz’s exit, which was first reported by independent journalist Mark Halperin,
after little more than 100 days has echoes of Trump’s first term, when four
different national security advisers — Mike Flynn, HR McMaster, John Bolton and
Robert O’Brien — each served in the role between 2017 and 2021.
As speculation increased about Waltz’s position, officials and diplomats in
Washington have been looking for signs that Trump would replace him with
someone who is seen as more loyal to the Maga agenda.",https://www.ft.com/content/4e92a301-acc8-42ee-a15a-90f02e3620fa
Ari Emanuel says the Frieze group ‘represents a strategic cornerstone,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/1/2025,Ari Emanuel to buy Frieze art fairs from Endeavor,"Hollywood powerbroker Ari Emanuel is buying the Frieze global art fair and
publishing group from Endeavor, the entertainment group he co-founded, in a deal
valued at $200mn.
The sale is likely to close in the third quarter of the year, according to a statement
by Endeavor on Thursday. While the terms of the acquisition have not been
disclosed, people with direct knowledge of the deal said it would value Frieze at
nearly $200mn, putting it above expectations.
It is the first purchase by Emanuel’s global events company, which is backed by a
consortium of investors including the investment companies Apollo Global
Management and RedBird Capital Partners.
Ariel Emanuel
“Frieze has always been a source of inspiration for me — both professionally and
personally,” Emanuel said. The fair group “represents a strategic cornerstone in
our new global events platform”, he added.
The consortium is also in the running to buy Endeavor’s tennis assets, which
include the Miami and Madrid Open tournaments, Bloomberg News previously
reported.
Endeavor — the US-based entertainment group that was bought for $25bn earlier
this year by the private equity firm Silver Lake — first bought a 70 per cent stake in
Frieze in 2016 under Emanuel’s leadership and then took full ownership in 2023. It
said last year that it was exploring a sale of Frieze.
Emanuel left his role as Endeavor’s chief executive in the wake of the takeover and
he is the executive chair of WME Group, Endeavor’s Hollywood talent agency.
Frieze was founded as a contemporary art magazine in 1991 and launched its first
fair in London in 2003. The group now runs seven events around the world,
including one in Seoul and four in the US, as well as a gallery hub in London. Next
week, Frieze New York opens its 13th edition.

Andy Bounds;Henry Foy,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/1/2025,"Europe ready to make Trump a €50bn trade offer, says EU negotiator","Brussels wants to increase purchases of US goods by €50bn to address the
“problem” in the trade relationship, the EU’s top negotiator has said, adding that
the bloc is making “certain progress” towards striking a deal.
But Maroš Šefčovič, the EU’s trade commissioner, suggested in an interview with
the Financial Times that the bloc would not accept Washington keeping in place 10
per cent tariffs on its goods as a fair resolution to trade talks.
Steep tariffs are due to be imposed on the EU and multiple countries in early July,
leaving the bloc racing to avoid a full-blown transatlantic trade war.
The US and EU had made progress through multiple rounds of in-person and
telephone negotiations since President Donald Trump imposed, then paused, 20
per cent tariffs on the bloc, Sefcovic said. He added that “his ambition” was still to
strike a “balanced and fair” deal with the White House.
Trump tariffs
Šefčovič said the key argument he was making to US trade representative Jamieson
Greer and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick was taking account of American
services exports to the EU, which would bring the overall trade deficit with Europe
to only about €50bn.
That could be closed rapidly with deals to purchase more US gas and agricultural
products, he said.
“If what we are looking at as a problem in the deficit is €50bn, I believe that we can
really . . . solve this problem very quickly through LNG purchases, through some
agricultural products like soyabeans, or other areas,” Sefcovic said.
“What is very important is that I think we understand each other a little bit better,
what is their position, where are they coming from? And I think they understand us
a little bit better,” he added. “I think we have a little bit more understanding on the
figures.”
But he cautioned it would be “very difficult” to reach a deal that was “clearly good
and acceptable for our member states and our European parliament”.
Trump on April 2 imposed a minimum additional tariff of 10 per cent on almost all
countries, while proposing extra “reciprocal” duties for some trading partners,
including 20 per cent on the EU. Trump later suspended the extra “reciprocal”
measures, giving partners 90 days to negotiate.
Sefcovic said the combined potential levies threatened against the EU by Trump
were “astronomical figures . . . we clearly communicated this to US: ‘this is unjust,
this is unfair’.”
Asked whether he would accept a 10 per cent levy as a floor in trade talks, Sefcovic
said the EU regarded that as a “very high level”, suggesting that the bloc would not
settle for a deal that kept tariffs at that level.
Since announcing the raft of tariffs, which roiled global stock markets and hit the
dollar and US borrowing costs, Trump has weakened some of the measures,
offering carve-outs for sectors such as the automotive industry.
“I see that there have been some, let’s say, adjustments or corrections,” Šefčovič
said. “I’m sure that I was not the only one to kind of point out some of the
potentially negative consequences.”",https://www.ft.com/content/2d7c7a07-1232-4115-9dca-e99bb068c879
Philip Georgiadis,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,/30/2025,Airlines warn of weakening demand for US travel among European tourists,"Two of Europe’s largest airlines have warned that some Europeans are starting to
avoid US travel, as President Donald Trump’s policies risk hitting some of the
world’s busiest flight paths.
Air France-KLM and Lufthansa have this week reported signs of weakening
demand on transatlantic routes among European passengers, although they said
the impact had been limited.
“We know there are a lot of customers that are holding back in buying tickets for a
little more clarity on . . . the border, and things like that,” Air France-KLM chief
executive Ben Smith told analysts on Wednesday, as the airline reported quarterly
results.
Airlines
Its chief financial officer Steven Zaat said there had been a shift in booking
patterns as demand from American travellers flying to Europe grew, while some
Europeans turned away from US trips.
Transatlantic bookings from Europeans for travel in May and June were down 2.4
per cent compared with the previous year. Travel in the other direction, driven by
high spending American tourists, was up 2.1 per cent.
Signs of travellers avoiding the US amid economic tensions and fears of a hostile
border pose a threat to the major European long-haul airline groups, which are
heavily reliant on their lucrative transatlantic routes.
Analysts at Barclays have estimated that US services generate at least 50 per cent
of profits for the three major European “flag carriers”: Lufthansa, British Airways
owner IAG and Air France-KLM.
Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa’s chief executive, also said on Tuesday that some
European passengers were showing hesitance in booking transatlantic trips. The
German airline reported a “slight weakening” in bookings for the busy summer
season, particularly for US travel.
“When it comes to vacation trips to the US, especially from the German, Austrian
and Swiss markets, it’s easy to imagine conversations around the kitchen table
where families are saying, ‘We don’t know yet if we really want to go,’” he said.
Spohr said the airline group would slightly cut its planned growth in transatlantic
flying in the fourth quarter, from 6 per cent year on year to 3 per cent, but that he
hoped demand would rebound.
“The discussions about tariffs are no longer as heated as they were four weeks ago.
That is why we believe that some of these bookings will be recovered in the coming
weeks,” he added.
Lufthansa said it had set up a “task force” to “respond quickly and flexibly to any
weakening in demand”, including by cutting flight schedules.
Shares in Lufthansa, IAG and Air France-KLM have been under pressure this year,
amid investor concern over the impact on those routes and the broader threat of an
economic slowdown weighing on demand for flying. The Financial Times this
month reported that the total number of overseas visitors travelling to the US
dropped 12 per cent in March, year on year.

Several other travel companies have also warned of signs of a hit to demand on the
transatlantic routes. Virgin Atlantic has noted a slowdown in demand from
travellers in the US, while Sébastien Bazin, the chief executive of French hotel giant

Cristina Criddle;Hannah Murphy,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/1/2025,Meta lawsuit poses first big test of AI copyright battle,"Meta will fight a group of US authors in court on Thursday in one of the first big
legal tests of whether tech companies can use copyrighted material to train their
powerful artificial intelligence models.
The case, which has been brought by about a dozen authors including Ta-Nehisi
Coates and Richard Kadrey, is centred on the $1.4tn social media giant’s use of
LibGen, a so-called shadow library of millions of books, academic articles and
comics, to train its Llama AI models.
The ruling will have wide-reaching implications in the fierce copyright battle
between artists and AI groups and is one of several lawsuits around the world that
allege technology groups are using content without permission.
Meta Platforms
Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic also face similar legal challenges over the data
used to train the large language models behind their popular AI chatbots, such as
ChatGPT and Claude.
“AI models have been trained on hundreds of thousands if not millions of books,
downloaded from well-known pirated sites. This was not accidental,” said Mary
Rasenberger, chief executive of the Authors Guild. “Authors should have gotten
licence fees for that.”
Meta has argued that using copyrighted materials to train LLMs is “fair use” if it is
used to develop a transformative technology, even if it is from pirated databases.
LibGen hosts much of its content without permission from the rights holders. In
legal filings, Meta notes that “use was fair irrespective of its method of acquisition”.
According to the court filings, the US group engaged in early discussions with book
publishers exploring options to license material to train its models. The plaintiffs
allege that Meta abandoned this because the works were available through LibGen,
leading to a loss of payments and control for authors.
In the discovery, Meta said, “if we license once [sic] single book, we won’t be able
to lean into the fair use strategy”. Meta argues in its defence that there was no
market for licensing such works for this purpose.
However, emails unearthed in the court’s discovery process show Meta employees
suggesting they were entering a legal grey area and appearing to discuss how to
avoid scrutiny when using LibGen, according to the claim documents.
In one email from January last year, Joelle Pineau, Meta’s recently departed head
of AI research laboratory FAIR, recommended using the LibGen data set.
In a subsequent email, Sony Theakanath, a director of product at Meta, said “in no
case would we disclose publicly that we had trained on libgen”. The email had a
subtitle “legal risk”, in which the risks or details below it have been redacted, as
well as another subtitle “policy risks”, which contained “copyright and IP”. The
email suggested mitigations such as “remove data clearly marked as
pirated/stolen”.
The case comes as Meta is pouring billions of dollars to become an “AI leader”,
developing its Llama models to compete against OpenAI, Microsoft, Google and
Elon Musk’s xAI.",https://www.ft.com/content/b1f4965f-6ea6-4afd-968b-76bb2f7acfc4
Myles McCormick,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/1/2025,Donald Trump says he will impose secondary sanctions on buyers of Iran’s oil,"Donald Trump has announced secondary sanctions on Iranian oil as Washington intensifies a
“maximum pressure” campaign against the Islamic Republic amid faltering talks over its nuclear
programme. 
The US president said on Thursday that anyone buying Iranian oil or products would be frozen out
of doing business with the US, stepping up a crackdown on a vital revenue source for Tehran and
further squeezing China, its biggest importer.
“All purchases of Iranian Oil, or Petrochemical products, must stop, NOW!” Trump wrote on his
Truth Social Platform. 
“Any Country or person who buys ANY AMOUNT of OIL or PETROCHEMICALS from Iran will be
subject to, immediately, Secondary Sanctions. They will not be allowed to do business with the
United States of America in any way, shape, or form.”
Trump has taken a tough line on Iran, escalating sanctions targeting its energy sector after
announcing in February a “maximum pressure” strategy “aimed at driving Iran’s oil exports to
zero”.
It was unclear how and when the latest measures would be implemented.
A Treasury spokesperson said: “We’ve been very clear and consistent in our actions up until this
point: anyone that seeks to engage in or facilitate any stage of Iran’s oil supply chain — including
refineries, purchasers, brokers and shippers, among others — is placing itself at significant
sanctions risk.”
The National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for further details.
Trump’s announcement came after a fourth round of talks between the US and Iran, due to be held
this weekend in Rome, was postponed earlier on Thursday. The foreign minister of Oman, which is
acting as a mediator, said on X that the delay was made “for logistical reasons”.

Experts;campaigners have called for greater urgency from ministers,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/1/2025,Elements of England’s social care reforms may not be implemented until 2036,"Elements of a long-awaited package of reform to tackle England’s struggling social
care system might not be rolled out for a decade, as the government faces criticism
for delaying a crucial overhaul of the sector.
A state-commissioned review, led by Baroness Louise Casey, into the crisis facing
adult social care has been asked to outline polices to be phased in over a 10-year
period, according to the Commission’s terms of reference.
“The Commission should produce tangible, pragmatic recommendations that can
be implemented in a phased way over a decade,” according to the terms of
reference, released on Friday. The review’s initial recommendations will be
published in mid-2026.
UK social care
“It will aim to make adult social care more productive, preventive and to give
people who draw on care, and their families and carers, more power in the system,”
it said.
Experts and campaigners have called for greater urgency from ministers in light of
“soaring costs” that are hitting the care sector, including higher national insurance
payments which came into effect last month.
The government’s plans for a so-called “National Care Service”, a publicly-funded
system of social care, will also be set out under the first phase of the review, which
launched earlier this week.
The second phase will yield longer-term recommendations to inform the
“transformation of adult social care” and be released in 2028, the year before the
next general election is expected to be held.
This stage will consider the care model needed to address “demographic change,
how services must be organised to deliver this”.
The recommendations from Casey, a veteran Whitehall troubleshooter, “must
remain affordable”, according to the terms of reference, “operating within the fiscal
constraints of Spending Review settlements for the remainder of this Parliament”.
Government officials emphasised that the recommendations would be phased in
over a period that aligned with the government’s 10-Year Health Plan for the NHS.
They added that work was already under way to reform adult social care, including
a £3.7bn funding boost to support health authorities, as well as money for an extra
15,000 home adaptations for disabled people.
Simon Bottery, senior fellow at The King’s Fund health charity, said: “As too many
people are left waiting too long for care, we urge the Commission to not wait until
its ultimate 2028 deadline before making its recommendations.”
“The challenge may be whether the government is willing to act more urgently — or
indeed at all — to implement these reforms.”",https://www.ft.com/content/94136574-6a83-44ed-84f2-433e390353db
Jeff Bezos has gradually shifted his attention away from Amazon;the ecommerce company he founded,NotNYT,0,FinancialTimes,5/2/2025,Jeff Bezos to sell up to $4.75bn in Amazon stock,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to sell up to $4.75bn worth of shares in the
ecommerce company over the next 12 months, regulatory filings revealed on
Friday.
Bezos, who stepped down as Seattle-based tech group’s chief executive in mid-
2021, will sell up to 25mn shares via an orderly trading plan running through to
the end of May 2026.
At Thursday’s closing price of $190, the stake is worth about $4.75bn. The trading
plan was set up in early March, according to Amazon’s latest quarterly filing.
The disclosure came hours after Amazon warned on Thursday evening of the
impact of Donald Trump’s global trade war, forecasting that net sales and
operating income could come in below Wall Street’s forecasts.
