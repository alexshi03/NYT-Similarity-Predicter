Carl Hulse,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Gets a Slow Start on Judges After Setting a Record Pace in First Term,"After an aggressive drive to reshape the federal judiciary during his first stint in
the White House, President Trump is moving more slowly so far this time, waiting
more than three months into his second term to announce his first judicial nominee
this week.
In a social media post late Thursday, the president said he had chosen Whitney
Hermandorfer, a lawyer in the Tennessee attorney general’s office, for a vacant
seat on the Cincinnati-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. He called
the former Supreme Court clerk “a Fighter who will inspire confidence in our Legal
System.”
The president starts his second term with far less opportunity to install judicial
picks than he did eight years ago, when he was handed more than 100 vacancies
after Senate Republicans stalled President Barack Obama’s court picks during the
last two years of his term. Currently, there are just over 40 federal court vacancies
after the Democratic-controlled Senate pushed to fill as many seats as possible
before President Joseph R. Biden Jr. left office.
Senators said they believed more Trump nominations were imminent and have
encouraged the White House to pick up the pace.
“I’ve been urging them to get a move on,” said Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri
Republican and member of the Judiciary Committee. “I've said to them over and
over again, ‘We’ve had a lot of vacancies in Missouri for a long time now and we
really need to fill them.’ ”
By this point in Mr. Trump’s first term in 2017, the Senate had already confirmed a
new Supreme Court justice, Mr. Trump had nominated an appeals court judge and
several other prominent judicial nominees were in the queue to be announced
within days after he made placing conservatives on the federal courts a
centerpiece of his first campaign. By the end of his first presidency, Mr. Trump had
named two other Supreme Court justices and the Republican-controlled Senate had
confirmed a total of 234 federal judges.
This time, after Mr. Biden and his Democratic allies in the Senate topped Mr.
Trump’s record on judges with 235 confirmed, the incoming administration has
only three openings on the appellate courts and 43 in the trial-level district courts.
Despite the slow start, Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who
chairs the Judiciary Committee and will oversee judicial confirmations, said that he
“was not worried from the standpoint that there’s less vacancies than there were
eight years ago.”
The administration also has prioritized filling executive branch posts and
ambassadorships rather than lifetime judicial appointments.
“They’ve just been absolutely determined to get the cabinet done and obviously
make progress with the big beautiful bill,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of
Texas and another member of the Judiciary Committee, referring to still-
developing tax and spending cut legislation. “They’ve got a lot of litigation. And
then they’ve made a priority for some of the ambassadors, which I don’t have any
quibble with.”
In comparison to Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden, who chaired the Judiciary Committee as a
senator, made his first judicial nominations in mid-April of 2021, naming 10
candidates. Mr. Obama, who was consumed by the financial crisis in 2009, his first
year in office, and was seen by some as moving too slowly on judges himself,
nominated his first judge in mid-March.
During his first run for president, Mr. Trump campaigned relentlessly on his pledge
to populate the courts with conservative jurists as he tried to cement his support
among social conservatives who were leery of his candidacy but also historically
cast their ballots with more attention to the consequences for the Supreme Court
and the judiciary.
After Mr. Trump’s election, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and
the majority leader, and Donald F. McGahn II, then his White House counsel,
agreed to focus the Senate on installing as many judges with conservative
credentials as possible. The judicial push became an overarching theme of Mr.
Trump’s tenure.
Mr. McGahn, now in private practice, called Ms. Hermandorfer a “stellar” pick and
said he was confident Mr. Trump would have second-term judicial success as well.
“President Trump is off to a strong start and it looks like he is picking up where he
left off,” Mr. McGahn said.
If confirmed, Ms. Hermandorfer, a Princeton graduate who was a co-captain of the
university’s women’s basketball team, would replace an Obama administration
appointee on the conservative-leaning appeals court.
As director of the strategic litigation unit in the Tennessee attorney general’s office,
she has argued high-profile cases, including defending the state’s abortion ban and
challenging a Biden administration prohibition on discrimination against
transgender students. Ms. Hermandorfer clerked for Justices Samuel A. Alito and
Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court and for Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh
when he sat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
“She has a long history of working for Judges and Justices who respect the RULE
OF LAW, and protect our Constitution,” Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.
Lawmakers said they expected the Trump administration to focus first on judicial
vacancies in states represented by Republican senators, avoiding fights with
Democrats who retain the power to block district court nominees for their states
under the committee’s “blue slip” tradition. More openings also exist in those states
after Republican senators balked at allowing the Biden administration to fill seats
there.
Conservative activists also hope that a strong showing by the White House in
naming conservative nominees could convince veteran federal judges named by
previous Republican presidents to step aside and allow Mr. Trump to fill their slots
with younger replacements who can spend decades more on the bench.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-judges-nominations.html
Qasim Nauman,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Signs Executive Order to End Federal Funding for NPR and PBS,"President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aiming to cut federal
funding for NPR and PBS, accusing the news outlets of producing biased coverage
and “left-wing propaganda.”
Mr. Trump instructed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds public
broadcasters in the United States, to end federal funding for NPR and PBS, to the
extent allowed by law. The outlets receive only a small portion of their funding
from Congress, with the rest coming from donors and sponsors.
The immediate impact of the order was unclear. The Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, a taxpayer-backed, private entity created by an act of Congress, is
funded two years in advance to protect it from political maneuvering.
“CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President’s authority,”
Patricia Harrison, the president and chief executive of the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, said in a statement on Friday. “Congress directly authorized and
funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal
government.”
Trump Signs Executive Order Seeking to End
Federal Funding for NPR and PBS
The executive order was the latest move by the Trump administration against what
it described as biased public media. The White House released a document
accompanying the order on its website, criticizing the two broadcasters’ coverage
of, among other topics, the Covid-19 pandemic and Hunter Biden, the son of former
President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Mr. Trump ordered the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and all federal
agencies to also cut indirect funding by forbidding public radio and television
broadcasters that receive federal funds from using that money for PBS or NPR
programs.
The chief executives of NPR and PBS testified before Congress in March, a heated
hearing in which Republicans assailed them for what they described as liberal bias.
The White House wants Congress to take back more than $1 billion for two years
that has been allocated for the Corporation of Public Broadcasting. Mr. Trump’s
order on Thursday instructed the board of the corporation to “cancel existing direct
funding to the maximum extent allowed by law” and “decline to provide future
funding.”
Mr. Trump’s executive order is “blatantly unlawful,” Paula Kerger, the president
and chief executive of PBS, said in a statement on Friday. “We are currently
exploring all options to allow PBS to continue to serve our member stations and all
Americans,” she added.
NPR said in a statement earlier on Friday that its editorial practices and decisions
are independent and free from outside influences, including political parties.
“Eliminating funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would have a
devastating impact on American communities across the nation that rely on public
radio for trusted local and national news, culture, lifesaving emergency alerts and
public safety information,” the statement said.
Ms. Kerger, the PBS chief executive, said in an interview that aired this week that
about 15 percent of the overall budget for public broadcasters comes from the
federal government.
“This is different than many other public broadcasters around the world, which are
largely state-supported,” she said on “PBS NewsHour.” “We are not.”
Nevertheless, in 2011 NPR assembled a 36-page document that detailed what
would happen if the Treasury stopped cutting checks to the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting. The document describes a precarious radio system that would bear
the blow poorly, with consequences for listeners across the United States.
Independent member stations get most of the money dedicated to public radio.
That makes them more vulnerable than NPR, which says it gets only 1 percent of
its budget from Congress.
Public television in the United States would likely be in worse shape because PBS
receives much more of its budget — about 15 percent of $373 million — from the
federal government.
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting sued the Trump administration this week,
accusing it of illegally trying to fire three members of its board. The administration
had not offered any justification for the dismissals.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-funding-npr-pbs.html
Qasim Nauman,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Says He Is Renaming Veterans Day ‘Victory Day for World War I’,"President Trump said Thursday that he would rename Veterans Day, on Nov. 11, as
“Victory Day for World War I” and May 8, widely known as V-E Day, as “Victory
Day for World War II,” so that the United States could celebrate its achievements in
those conflicts.
“We won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or
military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything,” Mr. Trump said in a late-night
post on Truth Social. “We are going to start celebrating our victories again!”
The announcement was not accompanied by an executive order, and Mr. Trump did
not say whether he intended for May 8 to be a federal holiday, like Veterans Day.
The power to create and amend public holidays rests with Congress.
Mr. Trump referenced the celebrations by America’s allies to mark V-E Day, for
“Victory in Europe,” this year. “We did more than any other” country, he said, to
achieve an Allied victory in World War II, a conflict that devastated most of Europe
and huge parts of Asia.
The V-E Day commemorations this year in Britain, France, Canada and other U.S.
allies will mark 80 years since the formal end of the war in Europe after Germany’s
surrender.
Mr. Trump’s claim that the United States did more than any other nation to defeat
Nazi Germany might be contested in Russia, which marks the Soviet victory over
German forces in World War II on May 9 every year. The Russian Victory Day,
which is meant to honor the 27 million Soviets who died in the war, is a national
holiday and one of the most important days on the country’s calendar.
Veterans Day was originally called Armistice Day in the United States to mark the
end of World War I. After World War II and the Korean War, it was renamed, and its
scope was expanded to honor all U.S. military veterans. Memorial Day, which falls
on the last Monday in May, specifically honors those who gave their lives for the
country.
In his post on Thursday night, Mr. Trump did not detail any specific celebrations he
wanted to see on these two days. He has previously expressed his desire to honor
the military with events such as parades in Washington.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-veterans-day-world-war-i.html
Eric Lipton,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Elon Musk’s SpaceX Could Make Billions If Trump’s Budget Proposal Is Approved,"Elon Musk and SpaceX are big winners in Donald J. Trump’s 2026 spending plan.
President Trump is delivering on Mr. Musk’s wish list at both NASA and the
Pentagon to reorient federal spending on space in a way likely to drive billions of
dollars in new business to Mr. Musk’s space technology company, if Congress signs
off on the budget plan.
At the Pentagon, Mr. Trump is calling for a massive jump in spending, an
extraordinary 13 percent increase, almost entirely through allocations in a
Congressional budget reconciliation plan under consideration.
The jump would happen while many other federal agencies would be slashed, in
part to supercharge federal spending in two areas where SpaceX is positioned to
profit: a vast missile defense system and space missions to Mars and the moon.
Trump’s Space Budget Reflects Influence of Elon
Musk and SpaceX
Mr. Trump has proposed a Golden Dome defense system to track and kill missiles
headed toward U.S. targets, possibly sent by China, Russia, North Korea or other
rivals.
Pentagon officials say SpaceX is considered likely to be the top recipient of this
burst of new spending, which could generate billions of dollars in new contracts for
the company.
That is because SpaceX manufactures both rockets that can launch military
payloads into orbit and satellite systems that can deliver the surveillance and
targeting tools needed for the project, which would require the largest military
investments the United States has ever made in space.
Mr. Trump’s budget plan also calls for an undisclosed but large amount of new
money for “U.S. space dominance to strengthen U.S. national security.”
The giant load of expected new business for SpaceX, which already had started to
become clear based on policy shifts Mr. Trump has made since January, has drawn
questions from Democrats in Washington, who have questioned if Mr. Musk is
cashing in on his enormous contributions toward Mr. Trump’s re-election and his
position as a top White House adviser.
SpaceX is already, by far, the largest recipient of Pentagon spending on existing
military low-earth-orbit communications systems, and it gets the largest cut of
Pentagon rocket launch contracts. Congressional approval for the plan to
significantly expand this spending would be a giant win for Mr. Musk and SpaceX.
Mr. Trump’s proposed budget calls for Pentagon spending for 2026 to be $113 billion
greater than for this year. But that increase would come entirely from allocations
Congress is considering via its reconciliation plan for the 2025 fiscal year,
according to Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute
and a former space industry executive, who pointed to a footnote in Mr. Trump’s
plan.
NASA’s budget faces overall cuts in Mr. Trump’s plan, but there are increases that
largely match SpaceX’s own corporation priorities.
The spending plan goes after Mr. Musk’s commercial rivals, calling for NASA to
phase out funding for the Space Launch System, a rocket program being led by
Boeing, and also the Orion astronaut capsule, being built by Lockheed Martin,
which was part of three planned flights to take humans back to the moon.
Instead, Mr. Trump’s budget calls for “more cost effective commercial systems that
would support more ambitious subsequent lunar missions,” an industry that
SpaceX now dominates. Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, which has developed its own new
rocket, also could be a big beneficiary of this shift, industry executives said Friday.
Both Blue Origin and SpaceX have moon landing systems that NASA is contracted
to use and that have not, at least so far, been targeted for cuts.
“Their design is easier to do than SpaceX,” said Doug Loverro, a former NASA
associate administrator for human exploration and operations who has also been
an adviser to the Trump administration, referring to Blue Origin’s moon landing
plan.
The NASA budget also calls for $1 billion in new spending to focus on a mission to
Mars, which has been the primary driving force for Mr. Musk since he first started
SpaceX. He is already building a new rocket, called Starship, to attempt to deliver
on this plan.
“SpaceX’s handprints are all over this,” said Mo Islam, a co-founder of Payload, a
commercial space news site. “I don’t see there is any other way to look at it.
SpaceX is positioned to be the primary beneficiary of the majority of these
budgetary moves.”
There are some items in the NASA budget that could result in declines in spending
at SpaceX, such as less spending on the International Space Station, where SpaceX
delivers both cargo and astronauts.
But SpaceX still will likely emerge the winner. It recently won an $843 million
contract to “de-orbit” the space station when it is retired in 2030. And Mr. Musk has
pushed Mr. Trump to speed up that retirement date.
“The decision is up to the President, but my recommendation is as soon as
possible,” Mr. Musk wrote on his social media platform, X, in February.
In the 2024 fiscal year, SpaceX secured $3.8 billion in federal contracts, most of it
from NASA and the Pentagon. The company has taken a total of $18 billion in
federal contracts overall in the last decade, a New York Times analysis of federal
contracting data shows.
Experts like Mr. Loverro have long argued that NASA is too focused on an over-
budget and behind-schedule moon program called Artemis, particularly the parts
of the effort that rely on Boeing and Lockheed. That said, Mr. Loverro said the new
spending plan “does impact SpaceX in a lot of very positive ways.”
But Mr. Harrison, the former industry executive, said it also opens up SpaceX and
the Trump administration to potential criticism.
“It taints this now all with a suspicion of improper influence,” Mr. Harrison said.
“Even if these are legitimate questions.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/elon-musk-spacex-trump-

Charlie Savage,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Pam Bondi Rolls Back Leak Inquiry Constraint Stemming From Fox News Case,"Attorney General Pam Bondi has rolled back a constraint on leak inquiries that the
Justice Department imposed more than a decade ago, making it easier for
investigators to get around a legal bar on search warrants to seize news gathering
records.
The safeguard was imposed in 2013 after the revelation that the F.B.I. had
portrayed a Fox News reporter as a criminal to bypass restrictions on seizing
reporters’ emails.
The change was part of a revised regulation Ms. Bondi issued this week involving
leak inquiries. Most of the discussion has focused on how investigators can once
again use court orders, subpoenas and search warrants to go after reporters’
information, ending a flat ban on those tactics imposed in 2021 by Attorney General
Merrick B. Garland.
Essentially, Ms. Bondi returned to the standard in place before Mr. Garland’s
intervention. But a close reading shows that in doing so, she also deleted a key
section of the earlier regulation that had emerged from the Fox News incident. The
In Leak Crackdown, Bondi Rolls Back 2013
Protection Stemming From Fox News Case
section had limited the ability of investigators to sidestep a 1980 law that generally
bars search warrants for newsroom records.
The omission was striking because many conservatives and Republicans were
outraged by the events that led the department, under Attorney General Eric H.
Holder Jr., to make the reform. The targeted reporter at Fox News, James Rosen, is
now the chief White House correspondent for another conservative network,
Newsmax.
In a memo last week announcing the end of Mr. Garland’s ban on using compulsory
tools to go after reporters’ communications records, notes or testimony, Ms. Bondi
declared: “This Justice Department will not tolerate unauthorized disclosures that
undermine President Trump’s policies, victimize government agencies, and cause
harm to the American people.”
But her memo did not mention any intent to also eliminate the change inspired by
the Fox News incident, which remained in place under the first Trump
administration. The department press office did not respond to a request for
comment.

had portrayed Mr. Rosen’s reporting for Fox News as criminal in a search warrant
application. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
Gabe Rottman, the vice president of policy for Reporters Committee for Freedom of
the Press, warned that the deletion of the safeguard raised the possibility “that you
could see a repeat of the James Rosen case” and said it “raises significant First
Amendment concerns.” He posted an analysis of the new regulation on the group’s
blog.
“Reducing or eliminating protections from journalists and their sensitive news
gathering records impairs not just the press but the public,” Mr. Rottman added. “It
harms the public’s ability to hold the government accountable.”
The issue centers on the Privacy Protection Act of 1980, which generally bans
warrants to search for and seize news gathering materials. But the law contains an
exception for cases in which reporters themselves are criminal suspects.
In 2009, Mr. Rosen reported on North Korea’s plans for a nuclear test. The Justice
Department opened a leak investigation and eventually prosecuted a State
Department contractor, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim. (In 2014, Mr. Kim pleaded guilty to
making an unauthorized disclosure of restricted information and was sentenced to
13 months in prison.)
It was vanishingly rare in the 20th century for the Justice Department to bring
criminal charges in a leak case. But it started to become common midway through
the George W. Bush administration and under Mr. Holder’s watch, the number
continued to soar.
Then, in May 2013, it came to light that investigators had seized two months of
Associated Press phone records and that they had portrayed Mr. Rosen’s reporting
for Fox News as criminal in a search warrant application, raising the prospect of an
unprecedented prosecution of a reporter for publishing information.
In seeking a warrant to gain access to Mr. Rosen’s emails at Google, an F.B.I. agent
told a judge that “there is probable cause to believe that the reporter has
committed or is committing a violation” of the Espionage Act — which criminalizes
the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive national security information — “as an
aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator” of his source.
Critics across party lines expressed concerns that the Justice Department was
going too far in its crackdown on leaks, and some lawmakers also accused Mr.
Holder of having misled Congress in earlier testimony in which he said he opposed
that idea and had never been involved in or heard discussions about any such
potential prosecution.
Justice Department officials countered that they never actually intended to
prosecute Mr. Rosen, and had only portrayed him as a criminal suspect to invoke
the exemption to the 1980 statute. Critics said the defense essentially amounted to
an admission that the department had gamed the law in bad faith.
“That tactic circumvents the clear intent of the Privacy Protection Act,” Mr.
Rottman said. “The law is meant to ensure that government can’t seek search
warrants for a journalist’s records or unpublished stories unless it has probable
cause to believe the journalist has actually done something really wrong.”
In response to the broader furor, President Obama ordered a review of procedures
for leak investigations, saying he was “troubled” that investigative reporting could
be stifled. Mr. Holder repeatedly met with news media leaders, acknowledging
criticism that the Justice Department had tipped too far toward aggressive law
enforcement.
He developed new guidelines for leak investigations. Those included forbidding
portraying reporters as co-conspirators in criminal leaks simply to circumvent the
legal bar on secret search warrants for their reporting materials. His regulation
said investigators could only invoke the exemption to the 1980 law if a reporter was
officially under investigation.
Those rules stayed in place until early in the Biden administration, when it came to
light that under the Trump administration, the Justice Department had seized the
communications records of reporters at The New York Times, The Washington
Post and CNN.
President Biden ordered prosecutors to stop seizing reporters’ phone and email
data. Mr. Garland established a regulation barring the Justice Department from
using “compulsory legal process for the purpose of obtaining information from or
records of members of the news media acting within the scope of news gathering,
except in limited circumstances.”
Last year, the House unanimously passed a bipartisan bill to strengthen the ability
of reporters to protect confidential sources. But it died in the Senate after Mr.
Trump instructed Republicans to “kill this bill.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/justice-department-leak-inquiry-rules.html
Edward Wong,NYT,1,US,5/1/2025,Marco Rubio Adds a New Title Under Trump: Interim National Security Adviser,"Secretary of state. Acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International
Development. Acting archivist for the National Archives and Records
Administration. And now interim national security adviser to President Trump.
Like a Christmas tree bedecked with shiny ornaments of every shape and size,
Marco Rubio, 53, has accumulated four titles starting with his confirmation as
secretary of state on Jan. 20, the same day that Mr. Trump took his oath of office.
It very well could be a record in the modern history of the U.S. government. And it
adds to the immigrant success story that is core to the narrative of Mr. Rubio, a
former senator from Florida whose father worked as a bartender and mother toiled
as a housekeeper after they left Cuba for the United States.
But the proliferation of titles raises questions about whether Mr. Rubio can play
any substantial role in the administration if he is juggling all these positions,
especially under a president who eschews the traditional workings of government

and who has appointed a businessman friend, Steve Witkoff, as a special envoy
handling the most sensitive diplomacy.
Mr. Trump announced Mr. Rubio’s newest position in a social media post on
Thursday afternoon, a surprise twist in the first big personnel shake-up of this
administration. The president had just ousted Michael Waltz from the White House
national security adviser job as well as Mr. Waltz’s deputy, Alex Wong. In the same
post, Mr. Trump said Mr. Waltz would now be his nominee to be ambassador to the
United Nations.
Mr. Rubio’s appointment to yet another job — as if he were cloned in a B-grade sci-
fi movie — was so sudden that Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokeswoman,
learned about it when a reporter read Mr. Trump’s social media post to her during a
regular televised news conference.
“Yeah, so that is the miracle of modern technology and social media,” Ms. Bruce
said. “So that is an exciting moment here.”
Scrambling to try to explain the events unfolding in real time, Ms. Bruce said:
“We’ve seen him be at the White House several times a week, his close working
relationship day to day with the president. They clearly have been in an
environment where they’ve gotten to know each other very well.”
The fact that Mr. Rubio now leads four bodies is a sign not only of the trust placed
in him by Mr. Trump, but also of the close relationship he has with Susie Wiles, the
veteran political operative who is Mr. Trump’s chief of staff.
Of course, having four jobs also raises more practical issues: Does Mr. Rubio get a
pay bump? Will he have time to hop around the globe to do diplomacy? How will he
delegate his duties?
There are precedents — sort of. From 1973 to 1975, Henry Kissinger held two of Mr.
Rubio’s jobs, secretary of state and national security adviser, in an experiment that
was considered a failure. In the current Trump administration, two officials, Kash
Patel, the F.B.I. director, and Daniel Driscoll, the Army secretary, have both been
interim head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives while also
serving in their more prominent posts.
But it might be more relevant to look outside the United States for examples. Xi
Jinping, China’s leader, is general secretary of the Communist Party, president of
China and chairman of the Central Military Commission — still one job short of Mr.
Rubio’s tally when counting his top titles (Mr. Xi is also the head of several party
groups).
The Senate unanimously confirmed Mr. Rubio to be secretary of state. But he
entered the other jobs under controversial circumstances. Mr. Trump fired the
head archivist, Colleen Shogan, in early February in an apparent act of retribution
against the National Archives and Records Administration. Leaders of the agency
had raised concerns about Mr. Trump’s holding onto boxes of classified documents
at his home in Florida after he left office in 2021, though Ms. Shogan was not
involved in that episode.
Four days before Ms. Shogan’s firing, Mr. Rubio announced he was the acting
administrator for U.S.A.I.D., as Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser to Mr. Trump,
and Pete Marocco, a political appointee in the State Department, were gutting the
agency. Mr. Marocco and members of Mr. Musk’s government-slashing task force
did the daily work of reducing the agency to a husk, cutting contracts and firing
thousands of employees, but Mr. Rubio signed off on the moves.
Mr. Rubio is moving the remnants of the agency into the State Department. Last
week, he issued a chart on his planned department reorganization that shows him
keeping the title of U.S.A.I.D. administrator.
Even before Mr. Trump appointed the top U.S. diplomat/archivist/aid agency
administrator to be interim national security adviser, some analysts were pointing
out the problems with Mr. Rubio holding all these positions.
“Occupying two (or in Rubio’s case, three) roles at once is never ideal — directing
government agencies and programs is a significant task that demands attention
and focus,” said a post on the site of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in
Washington, a government watchdog group, in March. “But Rubio’s current
positions are uniquely concerning.”
The writer, Gabriella Cantor, pointed out the obvious conflict of interest: The
archivist is supposed to ensure that other federal agencies, including the two Mr.
Rubio is also leading, preserve records. Now, with the addition of the White House
National Security Council, that becomes thornier.
As for the question of Mr. Rubio’s salary (or salaries), the State Department did not
reply when asked on Thursday.
That night, Vice President JD Vance threw out an idea on social media for how Mr.
Rubio could go even further as a one-stop shop for assuming new authorities.
“I think he could take on a bit more,” Mr. Vance wrote. “If only there was a job
opening for a devout Catholic…”
Mr. Vance had visited Pope Francis in the Vatican last month just hours before the
pope died.
Mr. Rubio laughed about the suggestion in an interview on Fox News. “We thought
about it,” he said. “Any unmarried Catholic male can be pope, but I got married and
I’m happily married, so I guess I’ll miss out on that one.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/marco-rubio-national-security-secretary-state.html
Aishvarya Kavi,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Army Plans a Big Parade That Could Fall on Trump’s Birthday,"The United States Army said on Friday it is planning a parade in Washington with
thousands of soldiers and military demonstrations celebrating the 250th
anniversary of its founding on June 14, which is also President Trump’s 79th
birthday.
The parade is set to include 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft and participation from 6,600
soldiers, according to a statement from the Army. A fireworks display and a
daylong festival are also planned, including equipment displays, musical
performances and a fitness competition alongside the military demonstrations.
The Army said the celebration was in honor of its 250th birthday but did not
mention that the president’s birthday happened to be the same day.
“Given the significant milestone of 250 years,” the statement said, “the Army is
exploring options to make the celebration even bigger, with more capability
demonstrations, additional displays of equipment, and more engagement with the
community.”
It was not clear from the Army statement on Friday which events would be held on
June 14 and which would happen in the lead-up to the anniversary. The White
House last month denied that a military parade was scheduled for Mr. Trump’s
birthday. But The Associated Press reported on Thursday that it had reviewed
military planning documents that had the parade scheduled for June 14.
When asked for clarification on the schedule, a spokeswoman for the Army
responded that planning was underway and suggested the festival with the display
of military equipment would be held on the 14th.
Mr. Trump has expressed a fondness for military parades since his first term, when
he backed off his bid for a spectacle after some in his administration balked at the
cost. The lack of enthusiasm in Washington and the comparisons to authoritarian
showcases of military might have failed to douse his interest.
“We’re going to show the people as we build up our military, we’re going to display
our military,” he told a reporter ahead of his first inauguration. “That military may
come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue.”
Mr. Trump again became enthralled with the idea after witnessing the grandeur of
Bastille Day in Paris in 2017, which featured an elaborate display of tanks, soldiers
on horseback and military jets flying overhead.
His own military advisers pushed back against the idea when estimates of the
price soared close to $100 million. But Mr. Trump did not let go of the idea.
“Maybe we will do something next year in D.C. when the cost comes WAY DOWN,”
he wrote on Twitter in August of 2018. He blamed local government officials in
Washington for inflating the price “so ridiculously high” that he had to cancel the
parade.
Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, asked last month if the city had been
contacted about plans for a military parade, repeated concerns about the cost and
the potential damage to the city’s streets from heavy combat vehicles.
“If military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of
dollars to repair the roads,” Ms. Bowser said.
While many countries, from France to North Korea, use such parades to mark
milestones, displays of military might are rare in Washington.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-birthday-military-parade.html
Kenneth Chang,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump’s 2026 Budget Proposes Cutting NASA Funding by $6 Billion,"Under President Trump’s proposed budget, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration would largely become the National Moon and Mars Administration,
with an almost singular focus on getting astronauts to those two destinations.
The Trump administration proposes a budget of $18.8 billion for NASA, down 24
percent from $24.8 billion in the current budget year. The plan would introduce $1
billion in new investments for Mars, which would aim to fulfill Mr. Trump’s pledge
during his address to Congress in March to “plant a flag” on Mars.
That budgetary change also aligns with the priorities of Elon Musk, who founded
his SpaceX rocket company two decades ago with dreams of one day sending
colonists to Mars.
The budget proposal does not offer any details of how the $1 billion would be spent,
or a timeline for getting astronauts to Mars. Mr. Musk has said he will launch to
Mars the new giant Starship vehicle that SpaceX is currently developing — without
NASA Proposal Would Shift Agency’s Focus
Away From Space Science
anyone aboard — in late 2026, and presumably would look to NASA’s Mars money
to help pay for that.
“This proposal includes investments to simultaneously pursue exploration of the
Moon and Mars while still prioritizing critical science and technology research,”
Janet Petro, the acting NASA administrator, said in a statement.
Deep cuts would slash spending elsewhere at NASA, especially the agency’s
robotic space science missions. Proposed cancellations include a mission to bring
back rock samples from Mars, and climate monitoring satellites. The Space Launch
System and Orion crew capsule that will take astronauts back to the moon would
be canceled after Artemis III, the first crewed mission that would land near the
moon’s south pole. Gateway, a small space station in orbit around the moon, would
also be canceled.
If enacted, “this is the largest single-year cut to NASA in American history,” said
Casey Dreier, the chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, a nonprofit
organization that advocates for space exploration. “This is a budget that says
America is done leading the world in space, that we are a nation turning inward.”
The budget plan also calls for scaling back operations at the International Space
Station, with fewer astronauts aboard and a slimmed-down research program. It
also proposes the elimination of NASA’s education efforts, portraying them as
“woke.” President Trump had tried to cancel NASA’s education efforts during his
first term — as had President Obama before him — but in both cases, Congress
restored the money.
For aviation, the budget would eliminate research to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions from airplanes.
The budget also proposes a cut of more than $1 billion in “mission support,” saying
there are savings to be made by reducing employee head counts, maintenance,
construction and “environmental compliance activities.”
A report by the National Academies last September, however, called for NASA to
greatly boost its spending on upgrading its infrastructure, much of which dates to
the 1960s.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-budget-nasa-

Mike Baker,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,"Before the Fire, L.A. Tried to Restore Second Reservoir in Palisades","Seven months before fire swept through the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los
Angeles, the city’s water managers were formulating a plan to revive an old
reservoir to temporarily boost the area’s limited water capacity.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was exploring the option
because the neighborhood’s main reservoir — the Santa Ynez Reservoir — had
been taken offline as a result of a torn cover, which officials had begun preparations
to repair early in 2024. The repair project was still months away from completion
this January when the fire broke out, and with the reservoir empty, firefighters ran
short of water in fighting the blaze.
Emails released to The New York Times under public records law show that the
city had searched for solutions to rectify the monthslong supply shortage but,
despite lengthy discussions and preliminary preparations, failed to correct the
problem in time.
In early June 2024, crews spent several days cleaning the Pacific Palisades
Reservoir, a facility that was about three miles away from the larger Santa Ynez
site, and that was retired in 2013. The work, officials wrote, was “in preparation for
temporarily placing the Pacific Palisades Reservoir back into service while the
Santa Ynez Reservoir is out of service.”
After the cleaning was completed, the crews planned more work, including
disinfection of the area and installation of new pipes.
But the plan to bring the old reservoir back online was never completed. Ellen
Cheng, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said
in an email on Friday that the city ultimately determined that bringing the
reservoir back online could have posed a risk to workers and residents of nearby
homes because of structural and other safety issues.
By the time the fire started in early January, the Pacific Palisades Reservoir
remained out of service and the Santa Ynez Reservoir was still two months away
from being operable.
The inability to bring either reservoir back online seriously undermined the
potential water supply in the area. The Santa Ynez Reservoir could hold tens of
millions of gallons of water. The Pacific Palisades Reservoir could hold more than
six million gallons.
Instead, when forecasts showed high fire danger before the inferno broke out, city
officials said they relied on a much smaller storage supply — three tanks in the
area that had a capacity of about one million gallons each. Hours after the fire’s
eruption on the morning of Jan. 7, by 4:45 p.m., one of those tanks was depleted.
Another was emptied that night. The third was drained by 3 a.m. the next day,
while the fire was still burning. Firefighters reported hydrants running dry in some
areas.
It is not certain how much of a difference the extra supply could have made. But it
appears clear that the second reservoir, if activated, could have helped maintain
total water capacity, in part by helping to sustain water pressure in the area.
Matthew Stumpf, a lawyer who is part of a legal team representing more than 750
wildfire victims, said they had been trying to get records and answers from the city
about how both reservoirs were managed. He said water supply issues were
central to some of the legal claims surrounding the fire.
“We believe it played a role in the destruction,” he said, adding that fire victims had
not been informed that the city had considered restarting the Pacific Palisades
Reservoir site.
That site had long been considered a firefighting supplement. Before the city
worked to add a floating cover on the Santa Ynez reservoir to improve water
quality and security, city officials added a cistern at the Pacific Palisades Reservoir
where firefighters could land a helicopter to refill their supply.
Ms. Cheng said the reservoir, built in 1929, had been retired because its low
elevation meant water sat there longer than was ideal, creating quality issues. She
said cracks were also causing leaks and the reservoir’s roof was compromised.
In recent weeks, crews completed the repair project at the Santa Ynez Reservoir,
and the city started refilling the reservoir, hoping to restore it to service this week.
But in the process, city officials said, more leaks were discovered, and it had to be
drained again.
City officials say they now hope to have the Santa Ynez Reservoir back in service
by the end of June.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/palisades-fire-reservoir-water-los-

Tony Romm,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Proposes $163 Billion in Cuts Across Government in New Budget,"President Trump on Friday proposed slashing $163 billion in federal spending next
fiscal year, a drastic retrenchment in the role and reach of government that, if
enacted, would eliminate a vast set of climate, education, health and housing
programs, including some that benefit the poor.
Issuing his first budget proposal since returning to office, Mr. Trump sketched out a
dim view of Washington. His blueprint depicted many core government functions
as woke, weaponized, wasteful or radical, as the president looked to justify his
request that Congress chop domestic spending to its lowest level in the modern
era.
Record-Low Funding for Domestic Programs
President Trump’s budget proposes shrinking nondefense funding to its lowest level since
the 1960s, when these records began.

Mr. Trump proposed cutting funding for some federal law enforcement, including
the F.B.I. He called on lawmakers to slash money meant to police tax evasion at the
Internal Revenue Service. He recommended striking billions in funds that help
finance clean water projects. And the president reserved some of his deepest cuts
for education, health and science, including the National Institutes of Health and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which would see their budgets cut
by around half.
Democrats immediately rebuked Mr. Trump for his proposal. Senator Chuck
Schumer of New York, the Senate minority leader, called it “heartless” and an “all-
out assault on hardworking Americans.” Even some Republicans took issue with
Mr. Trump’s budget, although others, like Speaker Mike Johnson, endorsed the
blueprint.
Mr. Trump also asked Congress to reduce, if not eliminate, billions of dollars in
federal aid to help the poorest Americans. For one, the White House called for
reconfiguring federal programs that provide rental assistance to low-income
families, cutting aid by more than $26 billion next fiscal year. And the
administration proposed the termination of a federal initiative, backed by some
Republicans, that aids needy families in paying their monthly heating bills.
In one of the few spending increases included in the budget, Mr. Trump asked
lawmakers to bolster spending at the Department of Homeland Security by more
than $43 billion, furthering his work to crack down on immigration, conduct

deportations and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. The president also
requested more than $1 trillion for the military next fiscal year.
But he asked lawmakers to approve that increase essentially on a one-time basis,
as part of a broader legislative package — due later this year — meant to advance
the president’s tax agenda. The approach angered some Republicans, who signaled
they would pursue a larger increase to military spending as part of the yearly
process to fund government agencies and programs.
“It is peculiar how much time the president’s advisers spend talking about
restoring peace through strength, given how apparently unwilling they’ve been to
invest accordingly in the national defense or in other critical instruments of
national power,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republicans’
former Senate leader, in a statement that denounced the administration’s
“accounting gimmicks.”
For Mr. Trump, the budget served to formalize his conservative vision and his
disruptive reorganization of the government, a campaign that has already
shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of federal workers without the
explicit approval of Congress.
Some of Mr. Trump’s proposed military increases could benefit Elon Musk, the tech
billionaire who has advised Mr. Trump on cost-cutting as part of the Department of
Government Efficiency
Mr. Trump’s budget supported the creation of a new missile defense shield and a
renewed campaign for “U.S. space dominance.” Both are areas in which Mr. Musk
and his rocket company, SpaceX, could stand to win major contracts funded by any
increase in spending.
Proposed Budget Change by Agency

In a letter Friday accompanying the spending blueprint, Russell T. Vought, the
leader of the White House budget office, said the administration had produced its
submission after a “rigorous, line-by-line review of spending.”
Mr. Vought added that the president sought to root out money “contrary to the
needs of ordinary working Americans and tilted toward funding niche,
nongovernmental organizations and institutions of higher education committed to
radical gender and climate ideologies antithetical to the American way of life.”
Sharon Parrott, the president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, said many of the budget changes contemplated by Mr. Trump still
seemed most likely to fall hardest on low-income Americans, particularly those
who rely on government services.
“This is the latest repudiation of some of what he promised on the campaign trail,
in terms of being a president who was going to seek to serve people struggling at
the margins of the economy,” she said.

Mr. Trump’s proposal is not law. Totaling about $1.7 trillion, after accounting for the
full set of spending changes the president seeks, the budget serves only as a formal
guide to Congress, where it immediately generated opposition.
“President Trump has made his priorities clear as day: He wants to outright
defund programs that help working Americans while he shovels massive tax
breaks at billionaires like himself and raises taxes on middle-class Americans with
his reckless tariffs,” Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the leading Democrat on
the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.
The criticism was not limited to Democrats, as Republicans also raised alarm about
cuts to some programs that serve the neediest Americans. Outlining her “serious
objections,” Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who leads the
Appropriations Committee, added in a statement: “Ultimately, it is Congress that
holds the power of the purse.”
By releasing the budget, Mr. Trump set the stage for what is bound to be a
complicated, monthslong process to fund the government and avert a shutdown
before an existing spending deal expires on Sept. 30. Entering that fight, many
Republicans have echoed Mr. Trump’s desire to slash federal spending, though
warring G.O.P. factions have disagreed at times over the exact scope.
Party lawmakers have also raced to identify potentially trillions of dollars in cuts
that they can include to finance a related package that would expand a set of
expiring tax cuts for families and businesses, one of the president’s signature —
and costliest — economic policy priorities.
But Mr. Trump’s proposal carries additional significance. He and his top budget
adviser, Mr. Vought, subscribe to the idea that the commander in chief wields
expansive authority to halt or cancel spending, even if Congress instructs
otherwise. Their view has paved the way for the administration to slow, freeze or
cancel billions of dollars in funds, sparking a vast array of lawsuits and prompting
more than three dozen ongoing federal investigations into their activities.
On Friday, Mr. Trump’s proposal left unanswered some of the most important
questions facing Washington and its finances. It was silent on the nation’s fiscal
trajectory, even as the president seeks to cut taxes in a sprawling and costly
legislative package that carries substantial implications for the nation’s $36 trillion
debt.
“It remains to be seen what the rest of the president’s proposals will hold, and
there is still the multitrillion-dollar question of whether the reconciliation bill will
blow up the debt,” said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a
Responsible Federal Budget, a group that advocates deficit reduction.
Nor did the president’s new budget address the future of the federal benefit
programs, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, that comprise the
largest share of federal spending annually. Some Republicans are particularly
interested in rethinking Medicaid, which provides health insurance to poor
families, as a source of savings to pay for their tax cuts.
The administration is expected to send those details in a fuller budget to Congress
as soon as this month.

Michael Levenson,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,‘No Appointments Here’: A Mad Dash to Get a Real ID Ahead of the Deadline,"Some have logged on late at night. Others have driven for hours. And some have
just given up. All in the hunt for a coveted appointment for a Real ID.
Starting on Wednesday, travelers in the United States will need a Real ID, passport
or other federally recognized document to board domestic flights, a requirement
that has sent many Americans scrambling for the security-enhanced, star-
emblazoned identification cards.
Perhaps nowhere is the search for appointments as intense as it is in New Jersey,
where just 17 percent of state-issued IDs are Real IDs, according to a recent CBS
News analysis of data from state motor vehicle agencies across the country. No
other state had a lower compliance rate.
Melissa Sussko, 26, of Nutley, N.J., said the only reason she had managed to find an
appointment for a Real ID at the Motor Vehicle Commision office in Wayne, N.J.,
was because a friend had recommended looking for openings on the agency’s
website at midnight. So she logged on at midnight and snagged one.
Another friend, she said, was planning to drive to Cape May, on the southern tip of
New Jersey, to get her Real ID at the only Motor Vehicle Commission office where
she could find an appointment.
“Everyone I know is fighting to get one,” Ms. Sussko said. “You can’t find any, at
all.”
Al Sohi, 54, a driving instructor in North Caldwell, N.J., said he had given up
looking for an appointment and planned to use his passport if he needed to travel.
“I wanted to get a Real ID; I can’t find the appointment,” he said. “It’s terrible.
They should do something to accommodate all the people who want a Real ID.”
Some people have traveled far for an appointment, and others have simply given up.

Some other states say they are also struggling to handle a surge of interest in Real
IDs, as news spreads that the Department of Homeland Security will require the
identification cards at airport checkpoints and federal facilities starting on
Wednesday, after repeatedly extending the deadline for years.
Long lines have been reported at motor vehicle offices in New York State, where 43
percent of state-issued IDs are Real IDs, and Maine, which has 27 percent
compliance, according to the CBS data. Pennsylvania, which reported 26 percent
compliance, has also faced a flood of applications.
“We have tens of thousands of folks weekly that are showing up at our driver’s
license centers to get the Real ID,” Michael B. Carroll, Pennsylvania’s secretary of
transportation, said at a recent news conference. “It’s a real challenge for us right
now because folks have waited until the last minute.”
CBS News found that 30 states were less than 70 percent compliant with the Real
ID requirement. Officials in many of those states, including New Jersey, say they
are working to accommodate everyone who needs a Real ID and emphasize that,
for many, there is no reason to panic.
“Demand is very high right now, and our challenges are not unique to New Jersey
— every state in the nation is facing similar pressures as enforcement approaches,”
said William Connolly, a spokesman for the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission.
New Jersey has been issuing about 23,000 Real IDs per week and posting
thousands of new appointments on its online scheduling tool each morning, Mr.
Connolly said. New Jersey also has a Real ID “emergency issuance program” for
residents who have to fly within 14 days for “life-or-death reasons” or have other
“urgent travel plans.”
Officials expect demand for Real IDs to ease in the coming weeks and months. And
many travelers may not need Real IDs to fly. Passengers will still be able to pass
through airport security with other forms of acceptable identification such as a U.S.
passport, a Global Entry card, a Department of Defense ID or a permanent
resident card, according to the Transportation Security Administration.
Travelers who only have standard state-issued driver’s licenses should “expect to
face delays, additional screening and the possibility of not being permitted into the
security checkpoint,” the T.S.A. said in a statement last month. The agency
recommends that these passengers allow themselves an extra hour to pass
through airport security and says, if possible, to bring another form of
identification such as a birth certificate or a Social Security card.
Travelers without a Real ID will still be able to board a flight with their passports.
Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images
“We have other ways to verify your identity if you don’t have a Real ID or
acceptable form of ID but know that this process may take longer, so you’ll need to
arrive at the airport early, and you should be good to go,” the T.S.A. said in a recent
“Ask Me Anything” session on Reddit aimed at easing anxiety around the
Wednesday deadline.
New Jersey officials say there are several reasons relatively few residents have
gotten Real IDs, even though the state has been issuing them since 2019.
For one, New Jersey is the state with the highest percentage of citizens with
passports, 80 percent, according to data compiled by the Center for American
Progress. Those people will not need a Real ID to board a plane if they show their
passport.
New Jersey also allows undocumented immigrants to get driver’s licenses, but
they cannot obtain a Real ID because the federal standards require proof of legal
status.
Residents in New Jersey can upgrade to a Real ID when renewing their licenses,
but they are not required to. Some other states like Maryland, which has 99 percent
Real ID compliance, require residents who are renewing to get Real IDs.
To apply for a Real ID, people generally need to provide a Social Security number
or proof of ineligibility, verify their address with utility bills, bank statements or
other documents, and prove their identity and legal status with additional
documents, including a birth certificate or a passport.
Gathering those documents is one thing. Finding an appointment is another. “I
went online and no appointments here, no appointments in Wyckoff,” said Lou
Petricone, 75, of Wayne, N.J., who has his Real ID but was hoping to get one for his
wife. “And my son-in-law is a principal in Nutley, and he had to go to Piscataway
and he was there for three hours.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/real-id-passport-domestic-

Chris Cameron;Maggie Haberman,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Considers Executive Order on College Athlete Payments,"President Trump is considering an executive order to examine payments made to
college athletes and whether they have created an unfair system, two people
briefed on the matter said Friday.
Mr. Trump’s focus on the issue — which he’s talked about in the past, one of the
people briefed on the matter noted — was renewed after he spoke with Nick Saban,
the famed former University of Alabama football coach, backstage at an event
Thursday night in Tuscaloosa, where Mr. Trump delivered an address to graduates.
The Wall Street Journal first reported on Mr. Trump’s consideration. The two
people who were briefed on it were not authorized to speak publicly.
The executive order would address newly expanded opportunities for student-
athletes to monetize their athletic careers. Last year, the N.C.A.A., the organization
that governs much of college sports, agreed to settle a class-action antitrust lawsuit
that had accused it and its member schools of exploiting student-athletes while
hoarding the profits of the lucrative college sports industry.
The $2.8 billion settlement, which is nearing approval, created a revenue-sharing
plan for college athletics in which schools would start directly paying their athletes,
a major shake-up of the college sports landscape. The N.C.A.A. has already
removed restrictions on athletes monetizing their athletic careers through
endorsements and sponsorships — known as “name, image and likeness”
payments.
The changes initiated an arms race in college athletics, as wealthy teams offered
larger and larger compensation packages to lure top talent into their programs.
Star players have since signed deals worth millions of dollars.
Mr. Saban, while coaching the Alabama Crimson Tide football team, criticized the
payments, saying that the system favored wealthy college sports programs that
could afford to offer better compensation to the best players. He argued that the
system was not “sustainable.”
Mr. Saban could not be immediately reached for comment. Other critics have said
the payments are distorting the competitiveness of college sports, beyond football.
This year’s men’s national basketball tournament, beloved by fans for its
unpredictability, featured the fewest upsets in recent memory.
Mr. Trump, who in the 1980s owned a team in the short-lived United States Football
League, has many allies among celebrity athletes and wealthy team owners. He
has been quick to weigh in on sports issues as a candidate and as president.
Mr. Trump is particularly vocal on cultural shifts in sports. In 2017, he urged N.F.L.
owners to fire players who did not stand for the national anthem as a way to
protest racial injustice and police brutality. He has defended the names of sports
teams with Native American names and images, criticizing the ultimately
successful movement to change them as political correctness.
The president has continued to fixate on that particular issue. As recently as last
week, Mr. Trump again criticized the name changes for those teams and
announced his opposition to the changing of a sports mascot of a public high school
on Long Island.
“I think the Indian population is a great part of this country,” Mr. Trump said,
adding, “I think it’s degrading to the Indian population.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-college-athlete-payments.html
Eileen Sullivan;Glenn Thrush;Maggie Haberman,NYT,1,US,5/1/2025,"Chris Krebs, Ex-Leader of Cybersecurity Agency, Is Under Investigation, Trump Officials Say","Trump administration officials said on Thursday that Chris Krebs, who debunked
President Trump’s lies about the 2020 election as head of the federal cybersecurity
agency, lost his membership in an expedited customs program for travelers
because he is facing a federal investigation.
The officials declined to specify why Mr. Krebs was under investigation, nor did
they indicate which agencies were conducting the inquiry. The disclosure came
three weeks after Mr. Trump, in an act of score settling and intimidation, directed
the Justice Department to investigate Mr. Krebs.
“Chris Krebs is under active investigation by law enforcement agencies,” a
spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. “That is
a fact disqualifying him for global entry.”
The department offered no further explanation about the inquiry into Mr. Krebs,
who was appointed to lead the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
by Mr. Trump in 2018. Asked about the suspension of Mr. Krebs’s Global Entry

Agency Is Under Investigation
travel program status, a White House official supplied a similar statement, offering
no other details. The official did not respond to a follow-up question.
It is unusual for a government law enforcement agency to confirm or deny an open
investigation. Mr. Trump has cited comparable breaches of protocol in accusing law
enforcement of trying to smear him during various investigations into his conduct.
The Global Entry program, administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a
division of the Homeland Security Department, allows low-risk travelers who have
passed a clearance process to avoid time-consuming screening procedures at
airports.
Mr. Krebs was fired after the 2020 election when he pushed back on
unsubstantiated claims by Trump allies that government super computers had
secretly switched votes from Mr. Trump to Mr. Biden. He later created a website to
fact-check allegations by Trump allies.
“The Nov. 3 election was the most secure in American history,” wrote Mr. Krebs,
along with state election officials, in a statement posted to the cybersecurity
agency’s website shortly before he was fired.
“There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes,
or was in any way compromised.”
The targeting of Mr. Krebs is the latest in a barrage of administration actions
intended to punish, embarrass, threaten and inconvenience Mr. Trump’s perceived
adversaries — in the case of Mr. Krebs, a respected public servant who offered a
factual corrective to his fabrications.
Mr. Krebs received an email on Wednesday alerting him that his status in the
Global Entry program had changed, prompting him to log into his account.
Even if Mr. Krebs is never charged, much less convicted, of any crime, the
allegations require him to devote time and resources to defending himself. A week
after Mr. Trump’s directive, Mr. Krebs resigned from the cybersecurity firm he had
joined, to focus on fighting the investigation.
A Justice Department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Mr.
Krebs had no comment.
In a memo Mr. Trump signed on April 9, he accused Mr. Krebs, a widely respected
cybersecurity executive, of being “a significant bad-faith actor who weaponized
and abused” his authority as a government official.
Among his purported misdeeds listed on the memo were “the censorship of
disfavored speech implicating the 2020 election” and the suppression of
“conservative viewpoints under the guise of combating supposed disinformation.”
Mr. Krebs was also stripped of his security clearance.
Since taking the presidency for a second time, Mr. Trump has been systematically
working through targets for retribution, most notably law firms that he has issued
or threatened to issue executive orders against.
The directive related to Mr. Krebs was the first time since taking office again that
Mr. Trump had publicly ordered investigations into individuals. Miles Taylor, a
Homeland Security Department official in the first Trump administration who has
been deeply critical of Mr. Trump, was also singled out.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/trump-chris-krebs.html
Madeleine Ngo,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Companies Are Raising Prices as Tariffs Hit,"More companies are starting to warn that they will have to pass on higher costs to
American consumers, raising prices for products like strollers, mattresses, power
tools and cast-iron cookware as President Trump’s tariffs take hold.
Some company officials said they had been left with no choice but to raise prices as
they pay more to import goods and materials into the United States. Other firms
have said they will soon run out of inventory for certain products because they
have paused orders from China.
Mr. Trump has upended the global trading system, hitting foreign countries with
punishing levies in an attempt to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United
States and take aim at what he calls “unfair” trade practices. But economic studies
have found that the burden of higher tariffs typically falls on domestic consumers
and companies.
Although Mr. Trump has scaled back some tariffs and paused others as he pursues
trade deals with foreign nations, the impacts of his policies are already starting to
eat into household budgets and frustrate Americans who have noticed higher

Prices Because of Tariffs

prices for their goods.
Some major companies have recently warned about impending price increases.
Stanley Black & Decker said on Wednesday that it raised prices on its tools and
outdoor products last month and will raise them again later this year. The German
sportswear company Adidas said this week that steeper tariffs would eventually
lead to higher prices for U.S. customers.
Executives at Procter & Gamble, which makes products like Bounty paper towels
and Tide detergent, said last week that the company would most likely increase
prices for some products to mitigate the effects of higher tariffs. And officials at
Hasbro recently said the toymaker would “have to raise prices,” although it would
try to “minimize the burden” on customers.
Some of the most immediate price increases have come in response to the
elimination of a loophole that allowed items worth $800 or less from China to enter
the United States without import fees. Shein and Temu, popular Chinese e-
commerce platforms, began adjusting prices for U.S. customers last week ahead of
the end of the tariff exemption on Friday.
Michelle Hall, a 48-year-old secretary in Snohomish, Wash., said she started buying
products from Temu late last year and has since spent about $2,300 on furniture,
car mats, sweaters, Christmas gifts and other inexpensive goods from the platform.
“It’s addicting and fun when you get your packages,” Ms. Hall said.
But over the weekend, she discovered extra “import charges” tacked onto her total.
A cart of six items from Temu that would have usually cost her $83.80 would cost
an extra $92.08 because of import fees, Ms. Hall said. On Wednesday, she noticed
that the platform appeared to take down many products that would have incurred
import fees, leaving only products that were shipped from local warehouses.
Ms. Hall said she planned to abandon Temu because she did not want to pay higher
prices, and its offerings seemed more limited now.
She said she still hoped that Mr. Trump’s tariffs would have some long-term
benefits. She voted for Mr. Trump in November, initially thinking his trade policies
could help reduce the deficit, create manufacturing jobs and make the nation less
dependent on foreign countries.
But Ms. Hall said she was not sure if those benefits would materialize. “In the
meantime, I feel like citizens are suffering,” she said.
Ms. Hall said she never thought her own costs would increase, and she originally
hoped that Mr. Trump would quickly bring prices down.
“I wanted to have faith,” she said. “I don’t have that faith anymore.”
Some companies have said they will begin raising prices in the coming weeks
because of higher tariffs. Joanna Rosenberg, the chief sales and marketing officer
at Zwilling J.A. Henckels, a German company that specializes in cutlery and other
kitchen products, said the firm would have to raise prices for some products in
early June. Premium knives from Zwilling and cast-iron cookware from Staub, one
of the company’s brands known for its Dutch ovens made in France, will see
“single-digit” price increases, Ms. Rosenberg said.
She said the company would have to raise prices more substantially for certain
knives from its value brand, Henckels. Some of those knives are produced in China,
which Mr. Trump has hit with a minimum 145 percent tariff. The president has
signaled that the rate could drop, though the White House has insisted it will not do
so unless China agrees to pare back its levies too.
“We don’t want to increase prices,” Ms. Rosenberg said. “There’s just no way that
we can absorb some of these price increases.”
As the cost of importing goods and materials into the United States rises, some major companies have

Some industries are being hit particularly hard because the bulk of their products
are made in China. About 90 percent of durable baby and children’s products sold in
the United States are manufactured overseas, with the vast majority produced in
China, according to the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association.
Several companies that sell strollers and car seats said they would have to increase
prices to offset higher costs from tariffs. UPPAbaby said last month that it would
adjust prices across most products. Evenflo increased prices between 10 to 40
percent for most of its products on Thursday. Cybex also increased prices for some
products on Thursday, which company officials said was “unavoidable.”
Steven Dunn, the chief executive of Munchkin, which sells products like high
chairs, strollers and diaper pails, said the company will likely have to increase
prices at a minimum of 20 percent for many products soon. And Mr. Dunn said the
company might have to discontinue 30 to 40 percent of its products after its current
inventory dwindles within an estimated 10 weeks.
“There are a lot of products that we just will not order anymore at the current
rates,” Mr. Dunn said. “You can’t pass on a 145 percent tariff to the consumer and
expect them to buy the same product.”
Mr. Dunn said that Munchkin paused its orders from China last month, and officials
have tried to move as much manufacturing out of the country as possible. Although
Mr. Trump has urged companies to make more products in the United States,
producing more baby products domestically is complex. “The tooling, the skills and
the automation just doesn’t exist here,” Mr. Dunn said.
Companies that make products in America are not immune to the impacts of higher
import fees, either.
Vy Nguyen, the chief executive officer at Avocado Green Mattress, said all of its
organic mattresses were made in the Los Angeles area. But many of the “core
natural components” that are used to make its mattresses, such as wool and latex,
are sourced from countries including India, Thailand and Guatemala. Those
materials have risen in price because Mr. Trump has instituted a 10 percent blanket
tariff on nearly all trading partners.
Avocado plans to increase mattress prices by about 6 percent and other products
by an average of 7.5 percent starting on Tuesday, company officials said.
Some brands have been more vocal about price increases because they are worried
about their ability to pass on cost increases to consumers, said Simeon Siegel, a
retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets. The companies want to ensure that
consumers “don’t feel like they’re having the rug pulled out from under them,” he
said.
Réalisation Par, which sells an array of silk dresses, said in an email to customers
last month that officials would have to raise prices for U.S. orders starting May 2
because its “silk pieces have always been crafted with care and expertise in the
home of silk — China.” In the meantime, customers could take 20 percent off their
order until late April, according to the email.
Fatima Ocampo, a 24-year-old data analyst in Sacramento, Calif., said she was
already eyeing several dresses from Réalisation Par when she saw the email. Ms.
Ocampo said she was planning to wait to make a purchase, closer to when she will
leave for her honeymoon in the south of France this fall. But she wanted to take
advantage of the lower prices while she could, so she bought three dresses from the
brand for about $400 later that day.
“I feel like it’s a clear example of how these tariffs are going to be a burden put onto
the consumer,” Ms. Ocampo said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/companies-tariffs-price-increases.html
Eric Schmitt,NYT,1,US,5/1/2025,U.S. Creating Second Military Zone Along Southern Border,"The Pentagon is creating a second expanded military zone at the southwestern
border, to be patrolled by U.S. soldiers, in the Trump administration’s latest step to
militarize the boundary with Mexico to help stem the flow of migrants.
The military’s Northern Command said in a statement on Thursday evening that it
was establishing a narrow strip of land along the southern border of Texas that will
become part of Fort Bliss, near El Paso. The strip will be about 63 miles long.
Last month, the Pentagon created a 60-foot-wide strip of land along 200 miles of
the border between New Mexico and Mexico, effectively turning it into part of a
U.S. military base there.
Migrants entering the newly designated military installations, or national defense
areas, will be considered to be trespassing and can be temporarily detained by U.S.
troops until Border Patrol agents arrive, military officials said.
A small group of migrants was charged on Monday with crossing into the military
zone in New Mexico after an Army helicopter spotted them approaching the border
and alerted the Border Patrol.
“The establishment of a second national defense area increases our operational
reach and effectiveness in denying illegal activity along the southern border,” Gen.
Gregory M. Guillot, the head of Northern Command, said in a statement.
General Guillot said that “service members who are already detecting and
monitoring through stationary positions and mobile patrols nearby can now
temporarily detain trespassers until they are transferred to an appropriate law
enforcement entity.”
The new Pentagon directives expand a military presence that has increased
steadily along the southern border in recent months, even as crossings have
already dropped precipitously during the Trump administration.
The Pentagon has sent nearly 8,000 active-duty troops to the border, as well as spy
planes in the skies and Navy warships offshore, to comply with President Trump’s
order in January to increase the military’s role in stemming the flow of migrants
into the United States.
Armed infantry and support troops from the Fourth Infantry Division at Fort
Carson in Colorado — one of the Army’s most seasoned combat units — make up a
major portion of the ground force in what the Pentagon calls Joint Task Force-

Mattathias Schwartz,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,"In Texas Borderland, Trump’s Immigration Push Suffers Its Worst Legal Defeat Yet","Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr., a bespectacled, soft-spoken 56-year-old nominated
by President Trump, turned his high-backed leather chair toward a government
lawyer at the federal courthouse in Brownsville, Texas, and asked a question. Can
the president define what counts as an invasion, then declare that an invasion is
happening, and then use a 1798 war powers law to expel the so-called invaders?
“Yes,” answered Michael Velchik, a Justice Department lawyer.
Judge Rodriguez followed up: Wouldn’t that make Mr. Trump’s powers under the
wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, “effectively limitless?”
The question hinted at a groundbreaking ruling that Judge Rodriguez issued on
Thursday when he found that Mr. Trump was wrong to claim that the activities of
Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang in the United States, amounted to an “invasion”
that justified invoking the wartime law.
The decision was the most sweeping ruling issued so far by a federal judge
blocking the most aggressive prong of Mr. Trump’s effort, one that was already
used to deport nearly 140 Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador on March 15. It
comes after a Supreme Court decision in early April that Venezuelan detainees
facing potential deportation under the Alien Enemies Act could file lawsuits in the
district courts where they were being held.
Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. during
his Senate confirmation hearing in
2017.
C-SPAN
The result of the court’s order has been that challenges to a key piece of Mr.
Trump’s immigration agenda, which began in Washington, are spreading around
the country, filling the dockets of federal judges and drawing tough and skeptical
questioning — even from jurists with impeccable conservative credentials.
Judge Rodriguez’s order came after five other judges hearing challenges of
detainees related to the Alien Enemies Act issued temporary orders that blocked
deportations for some or all of those held in their districts. In Colorado, a judge
found that there cannot be an “invasion” without “military and wartime action” and
that the administration had “improperly” relied on the words as a legal basis for
deportations.
Texas, with its extensive network of Immigration and Customs Enforcement
detention facilities, is beginning to play an outsize role in the litigation. Judge
Rodriguez is one of three Texas judges who have so far heard challenges from
groups of Venezuelans. When one of his colleagues, Judge James Wesley Hendrix
in the Northern District of Texas, declined to stop the imminent deportation of
another group of Venezuelans held at the Bluebonnet Detention Facility in Anson,
the Supreme Court stepped in and issued an emergency order blocking it.
In another case, Judge David Briones of the Western District of Texas ordered the
immediate release of a Venezuelan couple, rejecting the government’s claims that
they were members of Tren de Aragua.
The cases in Texas are also notable because federal courts there are reviewed by
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the most aggressively conservative
appellate court, which has issued a number of rulings supporting hard-line
immigration policies.
The possibility of an appeal to the Fifth Circuit has driven the perception that Texas
courtrooms might offer Mr. Trump the best chance to win rulings that would allow
his administration’s plan to scale up mass deportations to move forward.
That makes the skepticism he is facing there especially notable, said Stephen
Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “The administration
might have been overconfident in fighting so hard to have these cases heard in
Texas,” he said. “There are some legal questions on which reasonable judges from
across the ideological spectrum will disagree. But whether we are under invasion
from — or otherwise at war with — Tren de Aragua just isn’t one of them.”
A spokesman for the White House did not respond to a request for comment.
The origins of the case before Judge Rodriguez date to March 14 at the El Valle
Detention Center, 50 miles north of Brownsville. From there, two buses carrying
more than 200 men set off for the airport at Harlingen, and from there to El
Salvador, despite an order from another judge in Washington, James E. Boasberg,
requiring them to return.
Mr. Trump has trained his ire on Judge Boasberg, painting him as a radical liberal.
The president might have hoped for a friendlier reception in front of Judge
Rodriguez, where three of the men tried suing after the Supreme Court’s ruling.
Judge Rodriguez sits less than a mile from the Mexican border. Each weekday, one
floor down from his courtroom, U.S. marshals bring forward a parade of border-
crossers, some in orange prison smocks, some still in the street clothes they were
arrested in hours before. On Thursday, they stood five and six at a time before a
magistrate judge who took sips from a Whataburger cup as some men stood for
their arraignments and others waived their right to a jury trial and pleaded guilty.
Still, Judge Rodriguez has not immediately embraced the drastic measures the
administration is taking to reboot the immigration system, a sign that Mr. Trump’s
claims about the extent of his own power may be too bold for some of his judicial
nominees.
Two weeks before the hearing, Judge Rodriguez had issued a temporary
restraining order that barred the government from using the Alien Enemies Act to
deport the three plaintiffs, or any other El Valle detainee.
The break with Mr. Trump was surprising, said Jodi Goodwin, an immigration
lawyer in Brownsville who often appears before the judge. Of Brownsville’s two
federal judges, Ms. Goodwin said Judge Rodriguez was known as “the more
conservative, more strict judge.”
Judge Rodriguez, who declined to comment for this article, was the first Latino
chosen by Mr. Trump for the federal bench. During his confirmation hearing in
2017, the judge talked about being raised by a single mother and living near the
poverty line. He went to Yale, the first in his family to attend a four-year college,
then the University of Texas Law School, and went on to make partner at Baker
Botts, a powerful Houston firm. For eight years, he worked overseas for the
International Justice Mission, an evangelical Christian group that fights human
trafficking. “All these experiences,” he told the Senate, “enable me to empathize
with the vulnerable, the poor and the disadvantaged.”
At the immigration hearing, Judge Rodriguez took a careful, inquisitive approach
as he scrutinized the claims about the word “invasion,” a crucial term from both the
statute and Mr. Trump’s proclamation on March 14 invoking the war powers law.
The judge said he was searching for “the plain, ordinary meaning” of the word as it
was understood in 1798.
Mr. Velchik said “invasion” and “predatory incursion” could be applied to nonstate
actors like “Indian tribes” and “Barbary pirates.” But when Judge Rodriguez asked
him to back it up with “sources from that time,” Mr. Velchik came up empty. The
attempt to discern the law’s original meaning, a staple of conservative
jurisprudence that has been used to protect the rights of gun owners and restrict
access to abortion, now seemed to be working against the administration’s agenda.
Abby’s Bakery in Los Fresnos, Texas, was temporarily shut down after an Immigration and Customs
Enforcement raid in February. Valerie Gonzalez/Associated Press
Elsewhere in Brownsville, there were broader questions about whether Mr.
Trump’s approach to immigration was consistent with local tradition. In February,
Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided Abby’s Bakery, a pastry shop 16
miles from Brownsville. They discovered workers who were living on the owners’
property. Two were undocumented, according to a complaint filed in court; six had
visas to visit the United States but not to work. The two owners were charged with
harboring aliens, a crime with a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. They have
pleaded not guilty, and their trial, also before Judge Rodriguez, is scheduled for
July.
Jaime M. Diez, the lawyer representing the bakery owners, said the case had made
ranchers reluctant to board seasonal migrants who work as ranch hands, a practice
in the region for generations. “Everyone is scared,” he said. “They’ve been
arresting people left and right.”
Toward the end of the hearing, Judge Rodriguez examined whether a government
plan to give detainees as little as 12 hours to challenge their detentions complied
with an order from the Supreme Court that they be allowed “reasonable time” to
sue. He asked how detainees could challenge it. If they were somehow able to file
quickly, they would not have suffered any injury, he said. But if they were not able
to file, then the government could fly them off to El Salvador, beyond the reach of
U.S. courts.
“From my perspective, there’s a Catch-22,” the judge said.
Ms. Goodwin, the immigration lawyer, said 12 hours was insufficient, given the
demands on lawyers’ time since Mr. Trump took office. “My clients are petrified,”
she said. “‘Are they going to come to my house? Are they going to come to the
schools? Can I go to the doctor? You’re the lawyer. Can’t you do something?’ I
spend so much time just trying to calm fears.”
Muneer Ahmad, a professor at Yale Law School who represents immigrants as part
of the school’s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, called Judge
Rodriguez’s ruling “well-reasoned” and “significant.”
“For a Trump-appointed judge to so unambiguously rule that the invocation of the
statute was unlawful,” he said, “I hope will hasten the end of this legal charade.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-deportees-texas.html
Theodore Schleifer,NYT,1,US,5/1/2025,Charles Koch Says Many in the Country Are ‘Abandoning’ Its Principles,"Charles Koch, the billionaire industrialist and conservative megadonor, made a
rare public appearance Thursday evening and called for libertarians to embrace
their principles, in comments that seemed obliquely directed at a Republican Party
taken over by President Trump.
Mr. Koch was at one time among the most powerful forces in Republican politics. In
the 2016 election cycle alone, he and his allies spent $750 million to promote the
party’s candidates and causes. But his political power has waned significantly since
Mr. Trump’s election that year, and he is now seldom seen in Washington. And
neither do Republicans worry much about his plans in a party that is much more in
Mr. Trump’s image than in Mr. Koch’s.
But Mr. Koch, who will turn 90 this November, showed up in Washington to accept
an award from the Cato Institute. Almost 50 years ago, Mr. Koch helped found Cato,
one of the nation’s prominent libertarian think tanks. By 2012, Mr. Koch and his
brother David had given about $30 million to the institute, but the relationship
soured and the Kochs ended up suing the nonprofit before settling that June.
Accepting a prize named after Milton Friedman, the free-market economist, on
Thursday, Mr. Koch made his first public remarks since Mr. Trump was
inaugurated in January and enacted a number of policies that are anathema to Mr.
Friedman’s and Mr. Koch’s politics, most notably the sweeping tariffs.
Mr. Koch dispensed with the cheery rhetoric of most conservatives these days.
Speaking about the subsidies and protectionism of the past, he said that “you can
see why we’re in the mess we’re in today.” The billionaire often speaks about his
core “principles"" in business and philanthropy.
“With so much change, chaos and conflict, too many people and organizations are
abandoning these principles,” Mr. Koch later said, not uttering Mr. Trump’s name.
He added, “But we know from history, this just makes the problems worse. And
people have forgotten that when principles are lost, so are freedoms.”
Mr. Koch’s political group announced a $20 million campaign this year to try to
encourage the renewal of Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. But Mr. Koch has made no
secret of his profound disagreements with the president. In 2024, the Koch network
took a more muscular approach, but to no avail, endorsing Nikki Haley in her bid
for the Republican nomination. “CHARLES KOCH AND HIS GROUP GOT
PLAYED FOR SUCKERS RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING!” Mr. Trump posted as
Ms. Haley’s campaign sputtered.
Mr. Koch still has financial capital, even if not always political: A super PAC tied to
Mr. Koch spent almost $180 million on the 2024 cycle, a sum that does not include
spending by affiliated nonprofit groups. Mr. Koch has a net worth of $66 billion,
according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making him the 22nd wealthiest
person in the world, just behind the family of Julia Flescher Koch, the widow of
David Koch, who died in 2019. Mr. Koch’s firm, Koch Inc., is the second-largest
privately owned company in the country (Cargill is No. 1).
Mr. Koch’s speech in a Washington ballroom made for his most prominent
engagement since at least the pandemic. He has done a few podcasts and
interviews as late as early 2022 to promote his 2020 book, but he has largely ceded
the spotlight to his son, Chase Koch.
Approaching his tenth decade, Mr. Koch still speaks volubly and moves well. When
his speech was interrupted by protesters, Mr. Koch was not fazed.
“When you have those kind of enemies, you know you’re doing the right thing,” he
said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/charles-koch-trump-republicans-tariffs.html
Andrew Duehren;Maggie Haberman;Alan Blinder,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Says He’s ‘Taking Away’ Harvard’s Tax Exempt Status,"Harvard University signaled Friday that it would resist President Trump’s renewed
threat to revoke the school’s tax-exempt status, a move for which it said there was
“no legal basis” as the president escalated his bitter dispute with the nation’s oldest
university.
Harvard stopped short of explicitly pledging a legal challenge to a revocation of its
tax status, a change that would upend the university’s finances. But a
spokesperson for the university said in a statement that there was “no legal basis
to rescind Harvard’s tax-exempt status.”
“Such an unprecedented action would endanger our ability to carry out our
educational mission,” the statement said. “It would result in diminished financial
aid for students, abandonment of critical medical research programs and lost
opportunities for innovation. The unlawful use of this instrument more broadly
would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America.”
Harvard Signals It Will Resist Trump’s Efforts to
Revoke Tax-Exempt Status
Mr. Trump declared Friday morning on social media that the government would be
“taking away Harvard’s Tax Exempt Status.” Mr. Trump added, “It’s what they
deserve.”
Despite Mr. Trump’s assertion online and Harvard’s sharp response, it was not
immediately clear Friday whether the I.R.S. was in fact moving forward with
revoking Harvard’s tax-exempt status, a change that could typically occur only
after a lengthy process. Federal law prohibits the president from directing the
I.R.S. to conduct tax investigations, and I.R.S. employees who receive such a
command are required to report it to an internal government watchdog.
After Mr. Trump first publicly called for Harvard to lose its tax exemption last
month, White House officials said that the I.R.S. would make its own conclusion
about whether to do so.
Representatives for the I.R.S. and Treasury Department, which oversees the tax
collector, did not respond to a request for comment.
With its tax-exempt status, Harvard not only does not have to pay most taxes, but
donors can write off gifts to the school on their own tax returns. Losing the status
would not only force Harvard to start paying tax to the federal government on its
income but could cause donations to dry up. Philanthropy accounts for about 45
percent of Harvard’s annual operating revenues; most of that sum comes from a
payout from the university’s $53 billion endowment.
The intensifying standoff between the Trump administration and Harvard is part of
a broad pressure campaign against some of the nation’s most elite universities,
which the administration has painted as hotbeds of antisemitism and
discrimination that require federal intervention.
In recent weeks, Harvard has taken a decidedly confrontational posture toward the
Trump administration. The university rejected a roster of demands from the
government, including that it submit reports to Washington, alter its admissions
and hiring policies and bring in an outsider to examine “those programs and
departments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.”
The university sued after the administration froze more than $2 billion in federal
funds in retaliation for Harvard’s defiance.
Even before Mr. Trump first called for Harvard to lose its tax exemption, the Trump
administration has sought to transform the typically technocratic I.R.S. into a
political tool.
Trump officials pressured the I.R.S. to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement
find people it is seeking to deport, a decision that agency officials warned
undermined legal protections for taxpayer information. (I.R.S. officials can face
prison time if they improperly share taxpayer information, including details about
whether an individual or entity is facing an audit.)
The agency has had five different leaders so far this year, with the current acting
commissioner, Michael Faulkender, taking over after Treasury Secretary Scott
Bessent complained to Mr. Trump that Elon Musk had installed the previous acting
leader behind his back. Mr. Faulkender is also the deputy Treasury secretary.
Republicans have long accused the I.R.S. of improperly scrutinizing conservatives,
leading a series of investigations under the Obama administration into the
agency’s treatment of Tea Party groups. An inspector general later concluded that
the agency had improperly targeted both conservative and liberal organizations.
“I think Republicans should be quite cautious about using the I.R.S. against any
particular sector or narrow group of organizations,” said Scott Hodge, the former
president of the Tax Foundation, a think tank that favors lower taxes.
“Weaponizing the I.R.S. in any form is wrong. Policies should always be uniform
and neutral and based on tax principles.”
A group of Democratic senators — led by Chuck Schumer of New York, the
minority leader — wrote to the Treasury inspector general for tax administration,
the I.R.S. watchdog, to request that it investigate Mr. Trump’s targeting of Harvard.
They wrote that “it is both illegal and unconstitutional for the I.R.S. to take
direction from the president” on assessing tax-exempt groups.
Typically, the I.R.S. will challenge a group’s tax-exempt status after conducting a
lengthy audit to determine whether, for example, the entity is engaging in too much
political or commercial activity. If the I.R.S. decides to revoke a tax exemption, the
group can appeal the decision in court. Given Harvard’s vast research and
educational operations, tax experts expect a court would ultimately side with the
school.
“Been there, done that,” said Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on
Education and an under secretary of education during the Obama administration.
“The president has been saying this for weeks. Nothing has changed to make it
possible for him to take unilateral action on an institution’s nonprofit status.”
Even if the I.R.S. does not ultimately change Harvard’s tax status, Republicans are
preparing to substantially increase a tax on university endowments that the party
created in 2017.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-exempt-status.html
Karoun Demirjian;John Ismay,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Veterans’ Groups Object to Trump’s Proposal to Rename Veterans Day,"President Trump’s announcement that he planned to change the name of Veterans
Day, on Nov. 11, to “Victory Day for World War I” prompted a backlash from some
veterans’ groups, which complained that the move would champion conquest over
sacrifice and ignore the sacrifices of most living veterans.
In a social media post late Thursday, Mr. Trump also said he would declare May 8,
the date that Nazi Germany surrendered in 1945, “Victory Day for World War II”
instead of Victory in Europe Day, or V-E Day, as it is commonly known in the
United States.
But some veterans’ advocacy groups said the focus of the new names on winning
overlooked veterans who served in more recent wars that had more mixed results.
“It is not the veterans’ fault if we don’t win wars,” said Allison Jaslow, the chief
executive of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, who also served in Iraq.
She added that “Veterans Day should be an acknowledgment of the ways that
fellow Americans have served and sacrificed to protect and defend what we have in
America.”
In 2023, the census counted 15.8 million veterans living in America. This year, the
Department of Veterans Affairs estimated that about 66,000 American World War
II veterans were alive. There are no surviving veterans of World War I.
That means that with Mr. Trump’s proposed name changes, more than 99 percent
of living veterans — a group that includes Vice President JD Vance, who served
with the Marines in Iraq — would be left without a holiday commemorating their
service.
Congress recognized the need for a holiday that would encompass the service of all
veterans in 1954, when it passed legislation to formalize Nov. 11 as Veterans Day.
Since 1919, the date had been recognized as Armistice Day, in honor of the
agreement that the Allied powers and Germany signed to end World War I in 1918.
Congress had made Armistice Day an official federal holiday in 1938.
Though presidents enjoy fairly wide latitude to recognize certain occasions or
individuals by executive order, only Congress can create binding federal holidays,
meaning Mr. Trump cannot unilaterally force an official name change for Veterans
Day, which is one of 12 federal holidays that were established by law.
Some veterans’ groups pointed to the history of how Veterans Day was expanded
to include all veterans to argue that Mr. Trump’s proposal was undermining the
spirit of the holiday.
“Veterans Day began as Armistice Day, honoring the end of World War I — then it
was changed to honor ALL who served,” the group VoteVets, a left-leaning political
action committee, wrote in a social media post, adding: “Veterans don’t need
rewritten history. They need respect — and the benefits they earned.”
Democrats have argued that the Trump administration’s cuts to the V.A., which are
expected to include a reduction of 80,000 workers, will undermine veterans’
benefits.
A spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, a nonpartisan advocacy
organization created in the 19th century, said the group had reached out to the
White House to clarify Mr. Trump’s plans and inform the president that it continued
to endorse having the holiday honor the service of all veterans.
“Since the original legislation was introduced to change the name of Armistice Day
to Veterans Day — a day that is dedicated to all veterans who fought for peace —
the V.F.W. has endorsed that change,” said Rob Couture, a spokesman for the
organization’s Washington, D.C., office.
In February, Al Lipphardt, the group’s national commander, issued a statement
criticizing the Trump administration’s plan to cut tens of thousands of jobs from the
V.A., and spoke against it in congressional testimony.
Another major veterans group, the Disabled American Veterans, offered the most
succinct response to Mr. Trump’s proposal.
Their statement posted online said, “No.”
But one of the largest veterans’ service organizations has been notably silent on
the president’s Veterans Day announcement.
A spokeswoman for the American Legion, which was created through
congressional charter after World War I and calls itself “the nation’s most
influential, effective and dependable advocate of veteran affairs,” declined to
comment on Mr. Trump’s idea. The group also declined multiple requests for
comment in February when Mr. Trump allowed Elon Musk to fire tens of thousands
of federal employees, of which roughly 30 percent are military veterans.
Vietnam Veterans of America, which was started in 1978 and given a congressional
charter in 1986, did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Trump’s proposed renaming would effectively return Nov. 11 to its original
status as a holiday exclusively marking World War I. But while May 8 is recognized
as the end of World War II’s fighting in Europe, it is not the date that the United
States declared victory in the overall war.
The battles in the Pacific theater dragged on for several more months and were
punctuated by America’s use of nuclear weapons against Japan in Hiroshima on
Aug. 6, 1945, and Nagasaki on Aug. 9. Just days later, Emperor Hirohito of Japan
announced that his country would surrender unconditionally. Victory Over Japan
Day, or V-J Day, is celebrated in the United States on Aug. 14 because of the time
difference when that announcement was made.
But Japan did not sign a formal surrender agreement until Sept. 2.
Mr. Trump argued in his social media post that “many of our allies and friends”
already recognized May 8 as Victory Day, and that the United States should follow
suit because in World War II, “we did more than any other Country, by far.”
“We won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or
military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything,” he wrote. “That’s because we
don’t have leaders anymore, that know how to do so! We are going to start
celebrating our victories again!”
Poland and France celebrate Victory Day on May 8, while Russia celebrates it on
May 9.
Since the start of his second term, Mr. Trump has announced a series of name
changes. He ordered that the Gulf of Mexico be renamed the Gulf of America. Mr.
Trump also renamed the tallest mountain in North America as Mount McKinley,
undoing a 2015 decision that had restored the peak’s Alaska Native name, Denali.
This week, he announced via social media that he was “reinstating Columbus Day,”
though it has been a congressionally established federal holiday since 1934.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-veterans-day.html
Alan Rappeport,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,"U.S. and China Dig In on Trade War, With No Plans for Formal Talks","As trade tensions flared between the world’s largest economies, communication
between the United States and China has been so shaky that the two superpowers
cannot even agree on whether they are talking at all.
At a White House economic briefing this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent
demurred multiple times when pressed about President Trump’s recent claim that
President Xi Jinping of China had called him. Although top economic officials might
usually be aware of such high-level talks, Mr. Bessent insisted that he was not
logging the president’s calls.
“I have a lot of jobs around the White House; running the switchboard isn’t one of
them,” Mr. Bessent joked.
But the apparent silence between the United States and China is a serious matter
for the global economy.

Markets are fixated on the mystery of whether back-channel discussions are
taking place. Although the two countries have not severed all ties, it does seem that
they have gone dark when it comes to conversations about tariffs.
“China and the U.S. have not held consultations or negotiations on the issue of
tariffs,” Guo Jiakun, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, said at a news
conference last Friday. “The United States should not confuse the public.”
However, China’s Commerce Ministry said this Friday that it was now considering
holding talks with the Trump administration after repeated attempts by senior U.S.
officials to start negotiations. White House and Treasury Department officials did
not respond to requests for comment about whether such outreach had occurred.

other economic barriers. Those levies, which sent global financial markets
plunging, were paused for 90 days to give countries time to reach agreements with
the United States.
China, which reached a largely unfulfilled trade pact with Mr. Trump during his
first term, has indicated that it has little interest in talking about a new agreement
until the United States rolls back what it views as a barrage of aggressive and
unfair trade measures.
Mr. Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports to a minimum of 145 percent last
month, in a bid to force China into trade negotiations. Chinese officials responded
by issuing their own tariffs on American products and clamping down on exports to
the United States of minerals and magnets that are necessary for many industries.
The economic toll of the tit for tat is starting to become clear. The International
Monetary Fund last month lowered its growth outlook for both countries and the
world, warning that the tariffs had made a downturn more likely. Government data
released this week showed Chinese factory activity slowing in April and first-
quarter growth in the United States weakening.
During a cabinet meeting on Wednesday at the White House, Mr. Trump
acknowledged that children in the United States may wind up with fewer dolls that
cost more. But he insisted that he would continue to push for a “fair deal” with
China, which he described as the “leading candidate for the chief ripper-offer.”
The Trump administration is focused on trade deals with about 18 of America’s
most important trading partners that are subject to the reciprocal tariffs. Mr.
Bessent indicated that talks with China would operate on a separate track from the
other negotiations.
The Treasury secretary is expected to take the lead on the China negotiations while
Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, oversees most of the other talks.
However, Mr. Trump has not formally appointed or authorized a U.S. official to
negotiate on his behalf with China, leaving Chinese officials to believe that the
Trump administration is not ready or serious about trade talks.

country’s confrontation with Mr. Trump over tariffs. Doug Mills/The New York Times
Mr. Bessent, who had an introductory call with his Chinese counterpart in
February, said that he held informal talks with Chinese officials over issues such as
financial stability during the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank last week. He said that they spoke about more “traditional
things” but did not say that trade was discussed. The Treasury Department did not
issue a summary of any meetings with Chinese officials.
In an interview with Fox News this week, Jamieson Greer, the United States trade
representative, said that he met virtually for over an hour with his Chinese
counterpart before April 2 but that there had been no talks since Mr. Trump
announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs.
Our economics reporters — based in New York, London, Brussels, Berlin, Hong
Kong and Seoul — are digging into every aspect of the tariffs causing global turmoil.
They are joined by dozens of reporters writing about the effects on everyday people.’
Here’s our latest reporting on tariffs and economic policy.
Mr. Trump has suggested that Mr. Xi should call him to begin the talks personally,
noting their strong personal relationship. But that is not how China typically
handles important economic matters. The United States and China traditionally
work out their economic differences through a structured dialogue with formal
meetings and working groups led by a top economic official from each country.
“This very personalistic approach by President Trump, who wants to negotiate
directly with President Xi, doesn’t match with the Chinese system at all,” said Craig
Allen, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis. “In
the Chinese system, these things are carefully negotiated in advance, they go up
multiple channels and it is highly controlled and scripted, and when it gets to the
leader stage it is highly choreographed.”
Mr. Allen, who until recently was the president of the U.S.-China Business Council,
suggested that China was most likely mindful of the acrimonious meeting that Mr.
Trump had with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in February and that
Mr. Xi would be wary of a situation that could lead to a public confrontation with
Mr. Trump.
During the Biden administration, Treasury Department officials worked with China
to create economic and financial working groups of midlevel staff members that
were intended to prevent tensions over tariffs and export controls from spiraling
out of control. Those lines of communication do not appear to be in use in the
Trump administration, which tends to view them as a waste of time.
“That is exactly the kind of thing that these groups can help do — help make sure
that the policy you deploy is well tailored to achieve the objective and
communicates to the other side what you’re trying to achieve before it’s too late
and you instead have to react to potentially unintended consequences or a
message that was not intended to be transmitted,” said Brent Neiman, a University
of Chicago professor who was the Treasury’s deputy under secretary for
international finance during the Biden administration.
During Mr. Trump’s first term, the president initially assigned the Treasury
secretary at the time, Steven T. Mnuchin, to lead trade delegations to China. He
later appointed Robert E. Lighthizer, his trade representative, who was viewed as
more hawkish, to oversee the talks.
Veterans of that trade war believe the current deadlock could be more protracted
because the tariffs are higher and both sides believe they are winning. If U.S.
growth continues to slow while prices start to rise, it could add to the urgency for
Mr. Trump to get real talks with China going.
“I think at some point we have to give them a graceful off ramp,” said Wilbur Ross,
who served as Mr. Trump’s commerce secretary during his first term. “Whether
that is somebody from our side calling them first or whether it’s simply appointing
who will be our main representative — it may be at some point we need to make a
symbolic gesture.
Michael Pillsbury, a top China adviser to Mr. Trump during his first term, said
Beijing was most likely waiting to see what the deals that the Trump
administration reaches with other nations such as India and Japan look like before
engaging directly.
“They don’t want to start the formal talks because they want to know the bottom
line from others first,” said Mr. Pillsbury, who speaks to U.S. and Chinese officials.
He noted that the trade fight has become a major point of national pride for China
and that it believes that Mr. Trump’s demands — which Beijing does not fully grasp
— will soften as American markets gyrate and midterm elections in the United
States draw closer.
“Delay is very much in their interest, and a speedy deal is very much in Trump’s
interest,” Mr. Pillsbury said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/us-china-trade-tariffs-talks.html
Jason DeParle,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Seeks to End Permanent Supportive Housing for the Chronically Homeless,"While President Trump’s budget proposal seeks significant cuts in spending on
homelessness programs, its larger impact would come from changes in how the
money is spent.
With homelessness at record levels, the plan would increase money for emergency
shelters but end aid for permanent supportive housing, the focus of a decades-long
movement to serve society’s most vulnerable.
More than 300,000 people live in such housing, all chronically homeless and
disabled. Many are veterans. Critics warn that the change would not only forestall
the expansion of the permanent housing stock but force evictions of those it
currently helps, who rely on the deep subsidies that the budget eliminates.
“This is counter to the stated goal of reducing street homelessness, because it’s
putting people back on the streets,” said Barbara Poppe, a consultant to local
governments who worked on homelessness issues in the Obama administration.
The Trump proposal would abolish two programs that finance long-term housing —
the Continuum of Care Program and Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS
— and move them into the Emergency Solutions Grant Program. That program
finances short-term shelters and housing limited to two years.
The proposed cut of $532 million amounts to a reduction of about 12 percent in
combined spending. But none of the remaining money can be spent on long-term
housing, which supporters see as the most important safety net.
Permanent supportive housing emerged three decades ago as a solution to chronic
homelessness, initially with bipartisan support. Under a philosophy called Housing
First, it provides deeply subsidized housing and offers — but does not require
clients to accept — services for addiction or mental illness.
Proponents say it saves lives by getting chronically homeless people off the streets,
where they die at high rates. But in recent years, some conservatives have called
the approach permissive and said it fails to address the underlying problems many
homeless people face. Some blame it for recent surges in the unhoused population.
Many people come to permanent supportive housing after a decade or more on the
streets. In limiting their housing aid to two years, the Trump plan does not address
the question of what should happen after that.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-homelessness-

Lisa Friedman;Hiroko Tabuchi,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Administration Unveils EPA Overhaul With Shift to Approving New Chemicals,"The Environmental Protection Agency said on Friday that it would disperse
scientists from its independent research office to other divisions where they among
other things will be tasked with approving the use of new chemicals.
Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the changes to the E.P.A. in a video, saying
the agency was “shifting its scientific expertise” to focus on issues he described as
“mission essential.”
Most of the immediate changes will affect the Office of Research and Development,
the E.P.A.’s main research arm that conducts studies on things like the health and
environmental risks of “forever chemicals” in drinking water and the best way to
reduce fine particle pollution in the atmosphere.
An internal document previously reviewed by The New York Times outlined the
Trump administration’s recommendation to eliminate that office, with plans to fire
as many as 1,155 chemists, biologists, toxicologists and other scientists working on
health and environmental research.
Out at the E.P.A.: Independent Scientists. In:
Approving New Chemicals.
That didn’t happen on Friday, but the agency’s new priorities were made clear:
One hundred and thirty jobs will be moved to an office at the agency tasked with
approving new chemicals for use, Mr. Zeldin said. Chemical industry groups have
long complained of a backlog in approvals, which they say is stifling innovation.
At an all-hands staff meeting late Friday, Nancy Beck, a former lobbyist at the
American Chemistry Council who now heads the E.P.A.’s chemicals office, told
stunned scientists that it was “a very exciting time.”
“I encourage everyone throughout the agency to apply for these positions,” she
said.
Trump administration officials indicated that more changes were in store for the
research office. Scientists who were on the call said they were left with the
impression that if they did not move into one of the new areas, their current jobs
might be eliminated.
Also on Friday, the E.P.A. extended a deadline for accepting a deferred resignation
offer to May 9.
“This feels like the Hunger Games,” said one employee of the research office who
spoke on condition of anonymity, for fear of retaliation.
Other scientists will move into the administrator’s office as part of a new Office of
Applied Science and Environmental Solutions, which Mr. Zeldin said would “put
science at the forefront of the agency’s rule making.”
Democrats and environmental activists warned the move would politicize scientific
research.
“This so-called ‘reorganization’ is a thinly veiled attempt to extinguish the agency’s
world-renowned scientific expertise by shuffling scientists to process chemical
reviews for industry,” Representative Chellie Pingree, Democrat of Maine, said in a
statement.
The research office “is intentionally separate from E.P.A.’s policy offices, ensuring
it produces unbiased studies,” said Chitra Kumar, the managing director of the
climate program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group. Moving
the scientists into policy offices “could subject those experts to political influence,
particularly in this administration,” she said.
The changes come amid a major deregulatory drive at the agency. The E.P.A. under
Mr. Zeldin is revising or repealing more than 30 regulations aimed at protecting the
air, water and climate. The administrator also is overseeing an effort to dismantle
the legal underpinning for most climate regulations, known as the endangerment
finding.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-epa-cuts.html
Andrew Duehren,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Republicans Wrestle With Trump’s Demands for Tax Cuts,"It was easy to miss, but last weekend President Trump floated a fundamental
rewrite of the American tax code. In a social media post, and again in remarks to
reporters, Mr. Trump suggested the United States could stop taxing income under
$200,000 and instead rely on revenue from his extensive tariffs.
“It’ll take a little while before we do that, but we’re going to be cutting taxes, and
it’s possible we’ll do a complete tax cut,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Sunday.
“Because I think the tariffs will be enough to cut all of the income tax.”
The idea was news to Republicans on Capitol Hill already in the throes of
translating Mr. Trump’s impulses for cutting taxes into law.
Senator Mike Crapo, a Republican from Idaho who leads the Finance Committee,
said he had not heard from Mr. Trump or his staff about the proposal. “So I just
don’t know what that’s referencing,” he said.
Likewise in the House, where Republicans are preparing to release their first stab
at the tax bill in the coming days. “We aren’t having that discussion at all — it’s
never come up,” Representative Lloyd Smucker, a Republican from Pennsylvania
and a member of the Ways and Means committee, said of not collecting income
taxes on earnings under $200,000.
Even if they take a pass on Mr. Trump’s most recent notion, congressional
Republicans are straining to incorporate several of his previous tax proposals into
the legislation. Those include not taxing tips, overtime pay or Social Security
benefits, three of Mr. Trump’s campaign pledges that the White House has
continued to push in his second term.
House Republicans are planning to include those ideas in their version of the bill,
though their proposals are expected to be narrower than the blanket tax
exemptions Mr. Trump has advertised, according to lawmakers, staff and lobbyists
after the talks. Mr. Trump’s other ideas from the campaign trail, like allowing
Americans to deduct the cost of buying a generator, seem very likely to fall by the
way side.
While Republicans acknowledge they’ll now probably have to pass at least a couple
of Mr. Trump’s tax proposals, some still grouse about them.
“My beef with what’s being proposed right now, there’s no guiding principle other
than, ‘well, this is what President Trump promised on the campaign,’” said Senator
Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin. “I understand the political message
there, but let’s keep our tax code simple. I’d much rather lower the rates and keep
it simple, rather than do another little special carve-out deal.”
As with all of the tax cuts Republicans are considering, a chief concern about Mr.
Trump’s ideas is their cost. Without steps to curb their reach, the cost of the
campaign promises could balloon into the trillions, according to estimates from the
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Republicans are trying to limit how much they add to the deficit with the
legislation, forcing a parallel and politically treacherous negotiation over cuts to
spending on Medicaid and other programs that help low-income Americans. How
far Republicans can cut taxes, and what Mr. Trump’s ideas look like in practice, will
depend on how much in spending Republicans can ultimately agree to cut.
“I want to make sure that we get tax relief for hardworking Americans, which
seems to be the focus of those, but there is a finite amount of money as well,”
Senator Roger Marshall, a Republican from Kansas, said of Mr. Trump’s campaign
promises. “So I think the big debate is: How much money does the House want to
save?”
The leading proposal for not taxing tips — a bill crafted by Senator Ted Cruz,
Republican of Texas, and Representative Vern Buchanan, Republican of Florida —
would take a number of steps to limit the scope of the tax break.
Under their bill, Americans making more than a threshold that rises annually, set
at $160,000 this year, would still have to pay taxes on their tipped income. People
making under that limit would avoid income taxes only on the first $25,000 in tips
they receive, though they would still owe payroll taxes. To prevent all types of
workers from trying to claim the tax break, the bill tasks the Treasury Department
with limiting it to people in industries that traditionally receive tips.
It also excludes gig workers from the tax break. Some companies, including the
food-delivery service DoorDash, are lobbying for lawmakers to expand the tax
break to independent contractors. The company has invited its drivers, who work
as independent contractors rather than traditional employees, to write to members
of Congress about the issue, with nearly 40,000 of them doing so already.
“This is a matter of basic fairness — tips are tips,” Max Rettig, global head of public
policy at DoorDash, said in a statement.
While the details for not taxing tips are up in the air, Republicans expect their bill to
ultimately include limitations similar to what Mr. Cruz and Mr. Buchanan had in
their bill. Lawmakers said they were also trying to make sure the tax exemption
for overtime pay was targeted toward middle-and-low income Americans — and
would not create a gold rush in tax dodging for rich Americans. To hold down costs,
Republicans may approve the tax breaks only for the duration of Mr. Trump’s term.
Mr. Trump’s wish to not tax Social Security benefits is more complicated.
Republicans are using a special procedure called reconciliation to pass the tax
legislation without Democratic support. Reconciliation requires lawmakers to
follow a series of rules, one of which is that bills considered under the process
cannot affect Social Security’s finances.
To work around that prohibition, House Republicans, rather than directly changing
how Social Security benefits are taxed, are preparing to offer a more general tax
break to older Americans. Americans over 65 are already eligible for slightly larger
standard deduction, and Republicans have considered a further expansion.
“If we can do a deduction that erases the tax burden that our seniors pay on their
Social Security income, for people within a certain income threshold, it equates to
the same thing,” said Representative Nicole Malliotakis, a New York Republican
and member of the Ways and Means Committee. “It’s eliminating their tax burden.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/republicans-trump-tax-cuts.html
Zach Montague,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,"Trump’s Order Targeting Law Firm Perkins Coie Is Unconstitutional, Judge Rules","A federal judge ruled on Friday that an executive order President Trump signed in
March targeting the law firm Perkins Coie was unconstitutional and directed the
government not to enforce its terms, which had threatened to upend the firm’s
business.
The ruling was the first time a court had stepped in to permanently bar Mr. Trump
from trying to punish a law firm he opposes politically.
Skipping a trial and moving directly to a final ruling, Judge Beryl A. Howell of the
Federal District Court for the District of Columbia wrote that attempts to bring the
firm to heel under the threat of retaliation amounted to unlawful coercion, and
imperiled its lawyers’ ability to freely practice law.
“No American president has ever before issued executive orders like the one at
issue,” she wrote, adding, “In purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook
as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: ‘The first thing we do, let’s kill all
the lawyers.’”
The lawsuit was the first of four similar cases to reach a resolution. Lawyers
representing the firm had argued that the nature of the president’s order was so
obviously coercive that minimal time was needed to assess its illegality.
They argued, and Judge Howell agreed, that the order clearly violated the First
and Fifth Amendments, denying Perkins Coie and other similarly situated firms
freedom “to think and speak as they wish” and equal protection under the law.
Starting in March, Mr. Trump issued a series of executive orders labeling as
national security risks at least six major firms that had represented political
opponents or whose lawyers were involved in investigations into the president
during his first term.
The orders openly detailed Mr. Trump’s political grievances.
The one targeting Perkins Coie cited its past work with the liberal donor George
Soros, whom conservatives have vilified. A similar order targeting WilmerHale
complained that it had hired Robert S. Mueller III after he retired from his role as
special counsel in the investigation, during Mr. Trump’s first term, into Russia’s
election interference.
As a consequence of that past work, which the orders painted as a threat to the
“national interest,” Mr. Trump directed the government to bar those firms’ lawyers
from federal buildings, suspend active security clearances held by their staff
members and cancel any government contracts that could steer taxpayer funds
their way.
Faced with the prospect of sudden exile, firms began scrambling to broker deals
with the president, agreeing to take on hundreds of millions of dollars of pro bono
legal work in order to duck the punishing terms. Mr. Trump celebrated the
concessions, boasting that he had extracted close to $1 billion in free legal work for
causes he favors, all as penance “for damages that they’ve done.”
But the president’s public browbeating of elite law firms, with the express intent of
winning concessions, came as a boon for the handful of firms that instead opted to
fight back in court.
Lawyers for Perkins Coie and WilmerHale told the judges presiding over their
cases last week to look no further than the case of the Paul Weiss firm for proof of
the White House’s true intentions with the orders.
They noted how the grave concerns about national security and the need for urgent
reviews of security clearances stated in the orders appeared to evaporate the
moment Paul Weiss agreed to cut a deal.
Paul Clement, a lawyer for WilmerHale, told Judge Richard J. Leon in a parallel
hearing that the sudden retraction of the orders against Paul Weiss and others
betrayed Mr. Trump’s real goal, and that the unstated message from the White
House was so blatant it hardly merited discussion.
“The signal this sends to the whole bar is: Watch out. We’re watching. If you’re
litigating against the government or you’re not litigating against the government,
your behavior can be punished,” he said. “And there’s just no way to practice law
under those circumstances.”
Other firms that had been targeted, including Jenner & Block and Susman Godfrey,
have also asked judges in their cases to fast-forward to a decision.
Mr. Clement warned that the deals the White House was cutting undermined the
profession as a whole.
“If I have to stand up here and argue in front of the court today with one eye on
how this is going to be perceived by the executive branch and how that’s going to
influence the interest of my other clients, well, I might as well go sit down,” he said.
“That’s not how you can practice law.”
At the hearing in Perkins’s case, Judge Howell repeatedly asked Richard Lawson, a
lawyer for the government, to speak to an expert opinion filed by J. William
Leonard, a former Defense Department official who worked for decades
overseeing security clearances, and who compared Mr. Trump’s orders with tactics
Senator Joseph R. McCarthy had employed during the Red Scare.
In the opinion on Friday, Judge Howell wrote that the order ultimately “stigmatizes
and penalizes a particular law firm and its employees — from its partners to its
associate attorneys, secretaries and mailroom attendants — due to the firm’s
representation, both in the past and currently, of clients pursuing claims and taking
positions with which the current president disagrees.”
“In a cringe-worthy twist on the theatrical phrase ‘Let’s kill all the lawyers,’” she
added, the order was more specifically, “‘Let’s kill the lawyers I don’t like,’ sending
the clear message: Lawyers must stick to the party line, or else.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-law-firms.html

Mitch Smith;Hamed Aleaziz,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers Is Not Afraid of Trump Administration Immigration Warning,"A dispute over a memo about how Wisconsin state workers should interact with
federal immigration agents escalated this week into sharply worded warnings from
the president’s border czar, Thomas Homan, and the state’s Democratic governor,
Tony Evers.
Mr. Evers and others interpreted comments by Mr. Homan to suggest that he and
other elected officials could face arrest over local immigration policies, leading the
Wisconsin governor to say he was “not afraid” of what he described as “chilling
threats.”
The Wisconsin dispute was the latest chapter in a long-running fight between
President Trump’s administration and Democratic-led cities and states over
whether local officials must cooperate with federal Immigration and Customs
Enforcement agents.
In Wisconsin, Republicans had for days pushed for Mr. Evers to rescind a message
to state employees, issued on April 18 by the state’s Department of Administration.
The single-page memo instructed workers to call a state lawyer if an ICE agent or
other federal official visited their workplace. The memo told state workers to stay

calm and notify their supervisors, to not immediately answer an agent’s questions
and to not give them access to nonpublic areas. Chicago officials issued similar
guidance to city workers earlier this year.
The disagreement over the memo intensified outside the White House on Thursday
when a person who identified himself as being from The Gateway Pundit, a right-
wing website, asked Mr. Homan why the government was not simply arresting
“the leaders who are harboring and shielding” people who should be deported.
Mr. Homan responded, “Wait till you see what’s coming.”
When the reporter followed up by asking specifically about Mr. Evers and the
Wisconsin memo, Mr. Homan expanded on his first response.
“Wait to see what’s coming,” he said, according to video of the exchange posted by
C-SPAN. “I meant what I said: You can not support what we’re doing. And you can
support sanctuary cities if that’s what you want to do. But if you cross that line of
impede-ment, or knowingly harboring and concealing an illegal alien, that is a
felony and we’re treating it as such.”
Thomas Homan, the president’s border czar, spoke last year at the Republican

Mr. Evers responded on Friday with a video message in which he said “a Trump
administration official, in not so many words, apparently threatened to arrest me.”
“I haven’t broken the law,” Mr. Evers said in the video. “I haven’t committed a
crime. And I’ve never encouraged or directed anyone to break any laws or commit
any crimes.”
He added that “these threats represent a concerning trajectory in this country.”
“We now have a federal government that will threaten or arrest an elected official
— or even everyday American citizens — who have broken no laws, committed no
crimes and done nothing wrong,” said Mr. Evers, a former teacher and state
schools superintendent who is serving his second term as governor.
In the video, Mr. Evers also defended the memo and accused his political
opponents of distorting its content and intent.
“The goal of this guidance was simple: to provide clear, consistent instructions to
state employees and ensure they have a lawyer to help them comply with all
federal and state laws,” Mr. Evers said.
When asked by The New York Times on Friday to explain what he meant by his
previous comment about the Wisconsin governor, Mr. Homan said that the Trump
administration would not allow entities to impede immigration enforcement.
“I’m just saying: watch what happens. I mean, D.O.J. is taking a strong stance,” Mr.
Homan said, referring to the Justice Department. “They’re suing sanctuary cities.
We’re going to arrest people who cross that line of harboring and concealing. So if
they cross that line, just see what happens.”
Asked about whether Wisconsin’s new guidance violated the law, Mr. Homan said
he would defer to the Justice Department.
“I can’t answer that question,” he said. “We’ve got to leave that up to the
Department of Justice. They’re the ones to decide if it met that metric. They’re the
ones who decide at what point did it cross the line. I have my personal opinion, but
I’m not going to give you that because I don’t want to get ahead of D.O.J.”
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Evers had faced pressure over the memo from Republican state legislators,
who asked in a letter this week that he “rescind this guidance to avoid future
conflicts between state and federal authorities, to assist our brave men and women
in law enforcement, and to ensure the Trump administration’s goal of deporting
violent illegal immigrants is given the full assistance of the state of Wisconsin.”
Cracking down on jurisdictions that do not proactively cooperate with ICE has
been a priority of Mr. Trump and his appointees since the president returned to
office in January.
The Justice Department sued officials in Illinois and Chicago, arguing that their
laws limiting cooperation with immigration agents are illegal. The top federal
prosecutor in New Jersey said her office was investigating that state’s governor
and attorney general over their immigration policies. And the president has sought
to block funding for cities and counties that do not cooperate with immigration
officials.
Wisconsin, a swing state that Mr. Trump carried last year, has become a focus of
federal immigration policy in recent days. Last week, federal agents arrested a
state judge in Milwaukee who they said steered an undocumented immigrant
through a side door in her courtroom while agents waited to arrest him in a public
hallway.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/wisconsin-governor-tony-evers-homan.html
Minho Kim,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,"Appeals Court Allows Trump to Block Money for Federally Funded Newsrooms, for Now","A federal appeals court in Washington ruled on Thursday night that, for now, the
Trump administration could continue to withhold money from Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks,
federally funded organizations that provide news coverage to countries with
limited press freedoms.
In doing so, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
temporarily reversed parts of two lower-court rulings from last month that stopped
the administration from cutting off funds to the news outlets.
The appeals court kept in effect parts of one lower court ruling, which required that
Trump officials bring back journalists at Voice of America, another federally funded
newsroom, from paid leave and resume its news programming.
Unlike Voice of America, which is a government entity, the other three news outlets
are private nonprofits that have independent hiring authorities but receive nearly
all of their funding from Congress.
The order was an administrative stay, which temporarily blocks a lower-court
ruling until appeals court judges decide on whether to overrule the lower court
order while they reach a final verdict. It is a partial victory for President Trump,
who has accused the newsrooms of spreading anti-American and partisan
propaganda, and sought to dismantle the outlets’ parent agency in charge of
disbursing funds and overseeing their operations.
The ruling will deprive those news organizations of the funding they need for news
programming that around 140 million listeners tune into every week across the
world.
The news outlets have had to scale back their operations since March, when the
Trump administration moved to cut their funding.
They have terminated contracts with freelance journalists, missed payments on
office leases and furloughed employees. Lawyers for Radio Free Europe said it
would cease operations by June without more funds. Radio Free Asia has put most
of its staff on unpaid leave since March.
The funding that the appeals court effectively stopped on Thursday could have
allowed these newsrooms to continue reporting while fighting for their funding in
court.
Before the ruling came down, the Trump administration was scheduled to send
about $15 million to those news organizations by Friday, according to court filings.
That money included $12 million for Radio Free Europe’s April funding, which
Trump officials had withheld for weeks.
In March, the Trump administration terminated the grants for the three news
outlets after Mr. Trump signed an executive order seeking to gut its parent
organization, the U.S. Agency for Global Media.
Kari Lake, a close ally of Mr. Trump whom he hired as special adviser to the media
agency, declared her own workplace “unsalvageable.” She also claimed that the
media agency and its newsrooms were rampant with “waste, fraud and abuse,”
without providing evidence.
But the lower court judge, Royce C. Lamberth, ordered Trump officials to resume
funding, saying Mr. Trump could not unilaterally shut down an organization funded
by Congress.
“In this case,” the judge wrote in his ruling on Tuesday, “it was Congress who
ordained that the monies at issue” should go to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty
in a budget bill that was passed in March. The judge noted that President Trump
signed that bill himself.
“In short: The current Congress and President Trump enacted a law allocating
funds to the plaintiffs,” he concluded.
The appeals court decision to pause Judge Lamberth’s orders “should not be
construed” to mean that its judges had found that the Trump administration had a
better chance at winning the case, the three judges wrote in their ruling.
Two of the three appeals court judges overseeing the case, Gregory G. Katsas and
Neomi Rao, are appointees of Mr. Trump. The third, Cornelia T.L. Pillard, was
appointed by President Barack Obama.
A correction was made on May 2, 2025: An earlier version of this article incorrectly
stated which court ruled that the Trump administration could continue to withhold
money from federally funded newsrooms. It is the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit, not the United States Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-blocks-federal-news-funding.html
Annie Karni,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Former Fetterman Aide Expressed Concern to Doctor About Senator’s Mental Health,"The former chief of staff to Senator John Fetterman, Democrat of Pennsylvania,
was so alarmed with his ex-boss’s erratic behavior last year that he wrote a lengthy
letter to his doctor warning that the senator was spiraling out of control and that
his mental health issues could cost him his life.
“I’m worried that if John stays on his current trajectory he won’t be with us for
much longer,” Adam Jentleson, the former chief of staff, wrote on May 20 to a
doctor who had treated Mr. Fetterman at Walter Reed National Military Medical
Center.
Mr. Fetterman’s behavior, according to former aides who are still connected to his
diminishing circle, is still at times a cause of concern. Other former members of his
staff, speaking on the condition of anonymity, report that their colleagues
sometimes were frightened to be in the senator’s presence, if he was in an amped-
up mood.
They have also long been warned never to get in a car if Mr. Fetterman is behind
the wheel because of his dangerous driving habits. His volatile and concerning
behavior, which aides noticed last year was taking a turn for the worse, has only
increased since the election, people who have spent time with him said. That has
coincided with a period when his politics have become more conservative, as he
has watched his home state of Pennsylvania swing for Mr. Trump.
“He does not see his doctors,” Mr. Jentleson wrote last year to the medical director
who oversaw his 2023 hospitalization for mental health issues. “I am not sure when
he last saw a cardiologist, but I don’t think he’s seen one since he was released. He
long ago ordered us to stop putting regular drop-bys with Dr. Monahan on his
schedule, despite the fact that he had agreed to those as part of the plan.” Dr. Brian
P. Monahan is the Navy doctor who has served for nearly 15 years as the on-site
physician in the Capitol.
Mr. Jentleson’s letter, which was obtained by The New York Times, was first
reported by New York magazine.
What you should know. The Times makes a careful decision any time it uses an
anonymous source. The information the source supplies must be newsworthy and
give readers genuine insight.
Learn more about our process.
Mr. Fetterman said in a statement that “my ACTUAL doctors and my family
affirmed that I’m very well.” He called the New York magazine article a “hit piece”
and suggested that Mr. Jentleson and the author of the article, Ben Terris, were
“best friends” with a joint ax to grind, and that they “sourced anonymous,
disgruntled staffers with lies or distorted half-truths.”
(Mr. Terris revealed in his article that Mr. Jentleson is a personal friend.)
A spokesperson for Mr. Fetterman also raised questions on Friday about Mr.
Jentleson’s motivations for making public a deeply personal letter, given the
stigmas that already exist around mental health issues among men.
Mr. Jentleson declined to respond.
Mr. Fetterman, the first-term senator from Pennsylvania who had a near-fatal
stroke during his campaign, spent six weeks at Walter Reed in 2023 being treated
for clinical depression. When he was released, Mr. Fetterman seemed to have
turned a corner. He began adjusting to his life in the Senate, mixing it up with
reporters and colleagues in the hallways, and looked at it as a unique responsibility
to speak out on mental health issues.

“It’s a burden, but a privilege, too, to talk about it,” he told The New York Times in
an interview in 2023. “It’s also an opportunity to be very bipartisan. Red or blue, if
you have depression, get help, please. Don’t ever, ever, ever harm yourself. Do not
leave behind a blueprint of that.”
The auditory processing issues associated with his stroke also seemed to diminish,
and Mr. Fetterman began to casually converse with people without having to rely
on audio transcription.
As he has adjusted to life as a senator, Mr. Fetterman also grew more conservative,
mostly on Israel, but also on a range of other issues. The senator was the first
Democrat to meet with Mr. Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate after the election and
appeared to think that finding common ground was politically savvy at a moment
when his state was swinging further to the right.
An avid Fox News watcher, Mr. Fetterman even seriously considered voting to
confirm Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a former weekend host on “Fox &
Friends,” according to a former aide. The vote would have signaled a green light to
a cabinet appointee who faced accusations of excessive drinking and abusing
women that made it difficult even for Republican senators to get behind him.
It’s not clear to everyone who has worked closely with him that Mr. Fetterman's
political transformation, or his current challenges, is directly related to the mental
health crisis that first sent him to the hospital two years ago. But in his letter, Mr.
Jentleson describes unstable behavior he says could be a result of the senator’s
failure to follow the medical plan, including taking prescription medications,
outlined then by his doctors.
“John has pushed out everyone who was supposed to help keep him on his
recovery plan,” Mr. Jentleson wrote in the letter to Dr. David Williamson, the
medical director of the neuropsychiatry/traumatic brain injury unit at Walter Reed.
“We do not know if he is taking his meds, and his behavior frequently suggests he
is not.”

He said in the letter that people around Mr. Fetterman often witnessed the
“warning signs” his doctor had warned of, including “conspiratorial thinking,
megalomania (for example, he claims to be the most knowledgeable source on
Israel and Gaza around but his sources are just what he reads in the news — he
declines most briefings and never reads memos); high highs and low lows; long,
rambling, repetitive and self-centered monologues lying in ways that are painfully,
awkwardly obvious to everyone in the room.”
He said Mr. Fetterman spent most of his time scrolling on his phone and
formulating tweets, and that things with his wife, Gisele, were “tense.”
“He engages in risky behavior. He drives recklessly. He also recently bought a
gun,” Mr. Jentleson wrote, noting that purchasing a firearm was a warning sign
that he had been directed to report back to a medical professional.
Gisele Fetterman, in a statement to New York magazine, disputed the claims in Mr.
Jentleson’s letter, accusing him of lying about her husband’s condition.
In recent months, Ms. Fetterman has presented a united front with her husband.
She accompanied him on his visit to Mar-a-Lago after the election, and to a
meeting in Israel last month with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Still, many on his staff remain anxious about working for Mr. Fetterman, whose
mood can change dramatically from one day to the next. His driving remains an
area of particular concern.
The senator has long been known as a reckless driver, sometimes going more than
70 miles per hour in a 30-miles-per-hour zone. Last year, he and his wife, as well as
a 62-year-old woman, were hospitalized after he rear-ended the woman’s car on the
Eisenhower Memorial Highway in western Maryland.
Mr. Fetterman was driving well over the posted speed limit of 70 miles per hour,
according to the police report. Pennsylvania records indicated that Mr. Fetterman
had at least two prior driving infractions in the state in which he was going more
than 20 miles per hour above the speed limit.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/john-fetterman-mental-health.html
Jazmine Ulloa,NYT,1,US,5/1/2025,Family of 8-Year-Old Migrant Girl Who Died in U.S. Custody Seeks $15 Million,"The death of an 8-year-old migrant girl in 2023 while she was in the custody of U.S.
Customs and Border Protection prompted investigations and the removal of the
agency’s chief medical officer. Now, two immigrant rights groups are seeking $15
million in damages on behalf of the girl’s family.
In a wrongful death claim filed with the federal government on Thursday, lawyers
for the family offer the most detailed public account yet of the life and death of the
child, Anadith Danay Reyes Álvarez, and her family’s efforts to obtain answers
about her care in federal custody.
Her death came during a record increase in migration, as the Biden administration
struggled to curb illegal crossings and faced criticism about overcrowded detention
facilities and the treatment of minors. Illegal crossings plunged in the final months
of the Biden administration after a change in asylum policy, and have remained
very low under President Trump. But the Trump administration has made families
with children targets for detention and removal as President Trump seeks to fulfill
a campaign pledge to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.
Family Seeks $15 Million in Death of Migrant
Girl in U.S. Custody
Rochelle Garza, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, one of the groups that
filed the claim, said Anadith’s family wanted to ensure there was accountability and
transparency in Customs and Border Protection facilities, which she described as
“one of the most obscure and opaque types of detention in our American
immigration system.”
“They do not want their daughter to have died in vain,” Ms. Garza said.
Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the
Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment on the
wrongful death claim. After Anadith’s death, Troy Miller, then acting head of the
border agency, requested a review of CBP facilities and made recommendations to
address the medical care issues.
Anadith, a Panamanian national, was diagnosed with sickle cell disease and a heart
condition at a young age. When she was 5, she traveled with her father to Spain for
open-heart surgery and returned to Panama. The family made their way up
through Mexico and sought to cross into the United States in May 2023 in hopes of
providing safety and a better life for their daughter, according to the complaint.
Her parents, who are Honduran, are members of a long-persecuted Afro-
Indigenous population known as Garifuna, and had fled their own country before
their daughter was born. The other immigrant rights group that filed the family’s
legal claim was the Haitian Bridge Alliance, which focuses on serving Black
immigrants.

On May 9, 2023, she, her parents and two siblings were detained alongside other
migrants at the border near Brownsville, Texas. The family was then taken to a
processing center in Donna, a nearby city, where security camera footage showed
her parents handed over their daughter’s medical records to border officials in a
medical screening area, the claim states. But medical personnel there did not
properly assess her medical history or communicate the details of her medical
conditions to the staff at the facility in Harlingen where the family ended up,
investigators have found.
Anadith and her family were held in custody for nine days, more than twice as long
as newly arrived migrants, particularly children, should be detained, according to
the border agency’s own standards. In that time, Anadith exhibited a high fever
and complained of pain in her chest and abdomen, among other symptoms,
lawyers said.
The claim contends immigration officials failed to provide the girl with proper
medical care and to adhere to a 22-year-old consent decree that lays out the
minimum standards for care of the nation’s youngest new arrivals. Between the
evening of May 14 and her death on May 17, an internal investigation found,
medical professionals at the holding facility in Harlingen saw Anadith at least nine
times. A nurse practitioner who saw the child told internal investigators that she
dismissed three or four requests from Anadith’s mother to call an ambulance or
take the child to the hospital.
The previous year, a report from the detention ombudsman at Homeland Security
had warned that critical shortages in medical services at border facilities could put
migrants’ lives at risk. A report from the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this
year found the circumstances of Anadith’s death were “not an aberration, but
indicative of systemic problems” within border facilities and medical care.
Anadith’s family is now in the process of seeking asylum, and her parents have
secured work permits, lawyers said.
In an interview on Thursday, the girl’s mother, Mabel Álvarez, said her family had
filed the claim in hopes of preserving Anadith’s memory and preventing another
tragedy. She recalled that her daughter was healthy when she first arrived at the
South Texas border. But she said the small room where her family was detained
was filthy with trash and dust. She also recalled it was frigid, the reason such
facilities are often referred to as “hieleras,” or coolers.
Ms. Álvarez wept as she described staff members who she said ignored her pleas
for medical attention as her daughter’s condition worsened. After the family’s
release from immigration detention, Ms. Álvarez said, she took on a job at a factory
in New York, but she had to leave it as she struggled with depression and anxiety.
“It was a difficult thing, that my daughter died in my arms, looking for help,” she
said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/migrant-girl-death-cbp-damages.html
Isabella Kwai;Julian E. Barnes;David E. Sanger,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Waltz’s Use of Messaging Platform Raises New Security Questions,"Michael Waltz got himself in trouble with the White House when, as national
security adviser, he inadvertently added a journalist to a sensitive chat on Signal, a
commercial messaging app.
Now, as he leaves that job, he has raised a new set of questions about White House
use of the encrypted app. A photograph of him looking at his phone on Wednesday
during a cabinet meeting makes it clear that he is communicating with his
colleagues — including the secretary of state and the director of national
intelligence — using a platform originally designed by an Israeli company that
collects and stores Signal messages.
This discovery of the new system came when a Reuters photographer, standing
just over Mr. Waltz’s left shoulder, snapped a photo of him checking his phone.
He was not using a privacy screen, and when zoomed in, the photo shows a list of
messages and calls from several senior officials, including Vice President JD Vance
and Steve Witkoff, the special envoy who is negotiating on three fronts: the Israel-
Hamas talks, the increasingly tense dance with Vladimir V. Putin about Ukraine
and the Iran nuclear talks. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Tulsi Gabbard, the
director of national intelligence, are also on his chat list.
While the app that Mr. Waltz was seen using on Wednesday looks similar to Signal,
it is actually a different platform from a company that advertises it as a way to
archive messages for record-keeping purposes. That is critical, because one
concern that came up when senior officials were using the app was whether it
complied with federal record-keeping rules.
One of Signal’s benefits is that it is both encrypted and can be set to automatically
delete messages. But while that is a feature for users seeking secure
communications, it is a problem for the National Archives, as it seeks to retain
records.
It is not clear if Mr. Waltz began using the alternative app when he became national
security adviser or after a nonprofit watchdog group, American Oversight, sued the
government for failing to comply with records laws by using Signal.
While the real version of Signal gets constant security updates and messages are
kept encrypted until they reach a user’s phone, security experts question how
secure the alternative app is.
“This is incredibly dumb,” said Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who is a
longtime member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “The government has no
reason to use a counterfeit Signal knockoff that raises obvious counterintelligence
concerns.”
Cybersecurity experts said the platform that Mr. Waltz was using is known as
TeleMessage, which retains copies of messages, a way of complying with the
government rules. The screen in the photograph shows a request for him to verify
his “TM SGNL PIN.” Time stamps indicate that the communications were as recent
as the morning of the cabinet meeting.
TeleMessage, founded in Israel, was purchased last year by Smarsh, a company
based in Portland, Ore.
The TeleMessage platform accepts messages sent through Signal, and captures
and archives them.
Security experts said the use of the TeleMessage raised a number of questions.
Some said it appeared that the company had in the past routed information
through Israel, which is renowned for its electronic spying skills.
But a Smarsh representative said data from American clients did not leave the
United States. Tom Padgett, the president of Smarsh’s enterprise business, said the
collected information was not routed through any mechanism that “could
potentially violate our data residency commitments to our customers.”
Mr. Padgett also said the information was not decrypted while being collected for
record-keeping purposes or moved to its final archive. Security experts said that
whenever information is de-encrypted, security vulnerabilities could be
introduced. “We do not de-encrypt,” Mr. Padgett said.
Smarsh representatives took issue with the idea that their platform was a modified
version of the Signal app. They said their platform simply allowed financial
institutions and governments to capture communications on various channels to
comply with record-keeping regulations.
But cybersecurity officials said questions remained about how the TeleMessage
platform worked, and what vulnerabilities it could introduce into Signal
communications.
Signal is built on open-source code, which allows other organizations to make their
own version that uses the same encryption. But Signal Messenger, the company
that makes and controls the app, does not support alternative versions and actively
tries to discourage their use.
The screen of Mr. Waltz’s phone indicated that he had been in conversation with
several top Trump administration officials. Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters
Mr. Waltz’s use of TeleMessage was reported earlier by the publication 404 Media.
According to the publication, the U.S. government contracted with TeleMessage in
December 2024 to archive Signal and WhatsApp messages. Smarsh
representatives said they have worked with the federal government for a decade
but declined to discuss specific contracts.
It is not clear if the U.S. government audited TeleMessage to determine how it
handles the messages and whether it might break or damage the end-to-end
security of Signal. Representatives of the National Security Council staff did not
immediately respond to requests for comment. Smarsh representative said they
allowed security audits.
Mr. Wyden said the U.S. government and the Navy had developed secure
communications tools that comply with record-keeping rules. Using the modified
version of Signal is far less secure, he said.
“Trump and his national security team might as well post American battle plans on
X at this rate,” Mr. Wyden said.
In response to reports of the photo, Steven Cheung, the White House
communications director, said in a social media post that “Signal is an approved
app that is loaded onto our government phones.”
As part of the lawsuit filed by American Oversight, government officials have
submitted statements saying that the Signal messages from the chat Mr. Waltz
created to discuss strikes on the Houthi militia in Yemen are no longer retrievable.
Chioma Chukwu, the interim executive director of American Oversight, said she
had concerns about the use of the modified app.
“The use of a modified Signal app may suggest an attempt to appear compliant
with federal record-keeping laws, but it actually underscores a dangerous reliance
on unofficial tools that threaten national security and put our service members at
risk,” she said. “Americans have a right to transparency and to know their leaders
are following the law, not hiding behind unauthorized workarounds.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/mike-waltz-signal-photo.html
Stephanie Saul;Alan Blinder,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Harvard Hires Conservative Lawyers to Fight Trump Administration,"A former Texas solicitor general who argued in favor of abortion restrictions. Two
former clerks to Justice Clarence Thomas, one of the Supreme Court’s most
conservative members. And a one-time adviser to the Trump Organization.
These are a few of the conservative legal heavyweights Harvard University has
hired to win a lawsuit against the Trump administration.
The A-list squadron of Republican-aligned lawyers is a departure from the last time
Harvard faced a headline-seizing legal fight. Back then, in 2022, Harvard was
defending affirmative action and turned to a firm long associated with the
university, WilmerHale.
But the Trump administration has scrambled the legal landscape.
Now WilmerHale is under attack by the administration itself and is fighting its own
battle. And Harvard is facing down a fundamental threat after refusing a list of
administration demands that included eliminating professors “more committed to
Harvard’s Trick for Fighting Trump? A Deep
Bench of Conservative Lawyers.
activism than scholarship” and banning international students who oppose
“American values.”
Unlike last time, it has billions of dollars in federal funds on the line if it loses.
Legal observers have said that Harvard stands a good chance of winning on the
legal merits. Although the case could face headwinds if it reaches the Supreme
Court, the roster of conservative-aligned lawyers was designed to give the
university a boost in front of a court with a supermajority of Republican-appointed
justices.
“This fits with a long tradition of clients trying to signal to the Supreme Court
through the counsel that they hire that this is not Harvard liberal versus
conservative administration,” said Aaron Tang, a law professor at the University of
California, Davis. “This is academic freedom. It ought to appeal to someone across
the political spectrum.”
Lee C. Bollinger spoke during a graduation ceremony at Columbia University in 2017.
Seth Wenig/Associated Press
Lee C. Bollinger, a former president of the University of Michigan, said he had used
the same strategy when choosing a lawyer to argue an affirmative action case
before the Supreme Court in 2003.
“I understand exactly what Harvard is thinking in employing these lawyers,” he
said.
The Supreme Court’s swing vote at the time was Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, a
Reagan appointee. Michigan chose as its lawyer Maureen E. Mahoney, who had
served as a clerk for William H. Rehnquist, a Republican appointee who was chief
justice when the Supreme Court heard the case.
“I knew that Sandra Day O’Connor was likely to be the critical vote, and I wanted
somebody who would really understand how she thought and how she might think
about this case,” Mr. Bollinger, who subsequently became Columbia University’s
president, said in a telephone interview.
The strategy worked. The Supreme Court ruled in Michigan’s favor.
Harvard did not comment for this article. Its case against the government argues
that the Trump administration orders violate the First Amendment in several ways.
The university’s arguments also rely on a more arcane law, the Administrative
Procedure Act, which drives the process for federal agencies to develop rules and
impose penalties. The university said the government had ignored its own
requirements in order to cut federal funds.
In a social media post on Friday, President Trump said the government would be
“taking away” Harvard’s tax-exempt status. Such a move, if the administration
ultimately carries it out, could lead to another legal challenge.
For now, Justin Driver, a professor at Yale Law School who clerked for Justice
O’Connor, said Harvard’s roster of lawyers “underscores how deeply fractured the
right is during this fraught moment in our nation’s history.”
And for the lawyers involved, taking on Harvard as a client carries some risks. One
of the lawyers, William A. Burck, advised the Trump Organization until recently,
when Mr. Trump moved to fire him because he had agreed to represent Harvard.
Seventeen lawyers have officially registered for Harvard’s team, and there are
most likely others working behind the scenes.
Not all of them are known for being aligned with conservative causes. Joshua S.
Levy, for example, was the U.S. attorney in Boston for part of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s
presidency. He is now a partner in the firm Ropes & Gray. (Harvard still works with
WilmerHale on other matters.)
But Mr. Burck, a partner in the firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, is a Yale
Law graduate who clerked for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a Reagan appointee
who retired in 2018. Mr. Burck had also served as a deputy to Justice Brett M.
Kavanaugh in the George W. Bush White House and was once castigated by
Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, as a Republican partisan warrior.
At least seven other lawyers in the group have clerked for Republican-appointed
Supreme Court justices, including four sitting justices, before or during their
tenures in Washington.
In addition to Mr. Burck’s firm, at least three other firms are working on Harvard’s
case, including Lehotsky Keller Cohn. Steven P. Lehotsky, a Harvard Law graduate
who clerked for former Justice Antonin Scalia, worked in the Justice’s
Department’s Office of Legal Counsel during Mr. Bush’s administration and had a
central role in building Harvard’s legal team, according to a person familiar with
the strategy who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private
conversations.
Mr. Lehotsky, who was among the lawyers who appeared on Harvard’s behalf in
court on Monday for a conference in the case, did not respond to emails.

Madeleine Ngo,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Temu Stops Shipping Products From China to U.S. Customers as Trump Closes Tariff Loophole,"Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has stopped shipping products from
China directly to customers in the United States, a spokesperson for the company
said on Friday. Instead, all of its U.S. orders will be shipped from local warehouses
in America.
The change comes as the Trump administration closed a loophole that allowed
products made in China and worth no more than $800 to enter the United States
without import fees. The exemption, which President Trump has called a “big
scam” that hurt American small businesses, ended Friday.
Temu said last month that it would adjust its prices after Mr. Trump announced his
intention to close the loophole, known as the de minimis exemption. Last week, the
company started tacking on import charges for U.S. customers who wanted to buy

items from China. In some cases, that more than doubled the price of their
purchases.
In the past few days, some shoppers noticed that many products from China were
removed from Temu’s site, leaving only items that were shipped from local
warehouses.
The company said on Friday that pricing for U.S. consumers “remains unchanged
as the platform transitions to a local fulfillment model.”
“Temu has been actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform,” the
spokesperson said in a statement. “The move is designed to help local merchants
reach more customers and grow their businesses.”
More companies have used the loophole in recent years to ship inexpensive
products directly to U.S. customers without having to pay import fees. Some say
ending the loophole will hurt U.S. consumers by raising prices as well as
companies that had built their businesses around the exemption.
Others, including trade groups representing American textile makers, opposed the
loophole. Kim Glas, the president of the National Council of Textile Organizations,
said the exemption had allowed “unsafe and illegal Chinese goods” to flood the U.S.
market duty-free for years.
“Today’s action by the administration is an important step forward to help
rebalance the playing field for American manufacturers,” Ms. Glas said in a
statement.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/temu-shipping-china-tariffs.html
Julian E. Barnes,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,C.I.A. Fires Top Doctor Targeted by Far-Right Activist,"The C.I.A. fired its top doctor after she was targeted by far-right activists who have
worked to oust government officials they see as disloyal, according to a lawsuit
filed Friday evening.
Late last year, the C.I.A. recruited the doctor, Terry Adirim, to take a top medical
job as the director of the agency’s Center for Global Health Services. Within days,
Ivan Raiklin, a far-right provocateur, accused her of being the “architect” of the
Pentagon’s Covid-19 vaccine mandate.
Dr. Adirim, 61, had served in a top medical role in the Defense Department in 2021
when Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III mandated that all service members
receive a Covid vaccination.
Mr. Raiklin, who has called himself President Trump’s “secretary of retribution,” is
a former Green Beret who became an intense critic of the Covid vaccine. He
published a “Deep State Target List” of 350 individuals he accused of treason.
According to the suit, Mr. Raiklin also singled out Dr. Adirim for criticism.
Appearing on Rosanne Barr’s podcast, Mr. Raiklin accused Dr. Adirim of “genocide
and mass mutilation” for her support of the vaccine.
In a since-deleted post on social media directed at John Ratcliffe, who had been
chosen by Mr. Trump to lead the agency, Mr. Raiklin suggested that Dr. Adirim was
“burrowing in” at the agency, a term for political appointees taking civil service
jobs.
Mr. Raiklin is a close associate of Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national
security adviser, and serves on the board of directors of Mr. Flynn’s organization
America’s Future.
Dr. Adirim was told on April 4 that she was going to be fired. She twice asked why,
but her supervisor said “I have no information.” Breitbart News reported her
termination on April 8 in a social media message, which Mr. Raiklin reposted.
According to the lawsuit, Dr. Adirim was fired two days after Lara Loomer, a far-
right conspiracy theorist, visited the White House and demanded that several
national security officials be dismissed. Ms. Loomer later took credit for the firing
of Gen. Timothy Haugh, the director of the National Security Agency.
In the suit, Kevin Carroll, a lawyer for Dr. Adirim, said he would seek to prove
through discovery that Mr. Raiklin asked Ms. Loomer to request that Dr. Adirim be
fired.
The suit has no direct evidence Mr. Raiklin spoke to Ms. Loomer, but says he had
posted his support for her after the Oval Office meeting. “For the record, I respect
Laura Loomer,” he wrote.
Mr. Raiklin and Ms. Loomer did not respond to requests for comment on Friday
afternoon.
Dr. Adirim’s firing is expected to be finalized Saturday, a month short of when she
would have qualified for full federal retirement benefits, according to the lawsuit.
“Plaintiff and her family suffered terrible injustice only because her good service to
our country made her a target for a political extremist who defamed her and called
for the termination of her employment and even her death,” Mr. Carroll wrote in his
complaint.
The lawsuit says while serving at the Pentagon, Dr. Adirim recommended to Mr.
Austin that service members be given mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations, and notes
it was in the tradition set by George Washington, who ordered the Continental
Army vaccinated for smallpox in 1777.
“Plaintiff’s good advice saved the lives of American service members,” Mr. Carroll
wrote in the complaint. “While several troops sadly died of Covid-19 in the early
days of the pandemic in 2020-1, none died of Covid-19 after Secretary Austin
adopted her recommendation and ordered our armed forces vaccinated.”
On Dec. 11, Dr. Adirim signed a renewable five-year contract with the C.I.A.
When the agency told her on April 4 that she was being let go, an official also said a
clause in her contract allows termination with 30 days’ notice for “any reason.”
A spokeswoman for the C.I.A. declined to comment.
C.I.A. regulations give the director broad authority to fire employees. But a federal
court has issued a temporary stay on Mr. Ratcliffe’s attempts to fire C.I.A. officers

Michael Crowley,NYT,1,US,5/1/2025,How Zelensky Maneuvered Himself Out of the Doghouse With Trump,"Feb. 28 was one of the darkest days for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion three years
earlier. An Oval Office visit by President Volodymyr Zelensky meant to win favor
with President Trump turned into a televised shouting match, prompting Mr.
Trump to banish his guest from the White House without even serving him a
planned lunch.
Mr. Trump was already a deep skeptic of U.S. support for Ukraine. But after the
disastrous meeting with Mr. Zelensky, he accelerated his diplomacy with President
Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, drafting a peace plan to end the war in Ukraine that
offered major concessions to Moscow. Ukraine’s supporters were in panic.
But there is new hope in Kyiv.
A day after the Trump administration announced an economic deal with Ukraine
that gives the United States a stake in its future mineral revenues, analysts say the
country’s prospects look brighter than they have in months.

“These are very good signs that something might be shifting,” said Alina
Polyakova, the president and chief executive of the Center for European Policy
Analysis.
“It does seem like there’s change from the previous approach” by the Trump
administration, she said, calling the minerals deal “a win-win for both sides” that
Ukraine negotiated “very savvily.”
Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky also appeared to have a friendly meeting on Saturday
at the Vatican, as Mr. Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Mr. Putin’s
demands in the separate talks to settle the war.
Analysts cautioned against drawing firm conclusions about Mr. Trump’s intentions
toward Ukraine, however. The president’s zigzagging approach has confounded
observers as he veers between tactics and shifts blame from one side to another
and back again.
Adding to the confusion are sharp differences among Mr. Trump’s aides and
advisers about the right approach. Mr. Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who
has met with Mr. Putin four times, speaks in terms sympathetic to — and
sometimes in close harmony with — Kremlin talking points. Secretary of State
Marco Rubio, by contrast, was a vociferous critic of Mr. Putin during his Senate
tenure and has struck a more skeptical tone.
The chaotic approach underscores the folly of Mr. Trump’s claim as a candidate last
year that he could somehow settle the conflict in just 24 hours. This week he
reached 100 days in office without even a temporary cease-fire to show for his
persistent efforts — a subject of obvious irritation for Mr. Trump.
“The president tends to want to get results quickly, and this has been a very
frustrating process,” Ms. Polyakova said.
At the moment, Mr. Trump’s frustration appears to have shifted from Mr. Zelensky
to Mr. Putin.
The Russian leader has welcomed Mr. Trump’s diplomacy and talk of a
transformed U.S.-Russia relationship. But on the matter of ending the war he
began, Mr. Putin has dragged his feet. Many analysts say Mr. Putin believes he has
the upper hand in the conflict and has little motivation to end the fighting without
even more concessions than Mr. Trump has offered him.
Mr. Putin may also have banked on Mr. Trump’s long — and in many ways
continuing — record of giving him what he wants.
But Mr. Putin may be testing the limits of that strategy. In recent weeks Mr. Trump
has leveled sharp criticism at a Russian leader he has sometimes contorted himself
to avoid offending. “Vladimir, STOP!” Mr. Trump wrote on social media last week
after a particularly deadly Russian missile attack on Kyiv. “Let’s get the Peace Deal
DONE!”
Mr. Trump has increasingly criticized President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, including

Now Mr. Trump faces critical decision points that could help decide Ukraine’s fate.
His choices are especially hard, analysts say, because Mr. Trump’s desire for a
quick peace is in tension with his innate mistrust of Mr. Zelensky and his
admiration for Mr. Putin.
The first big choice Mr. Trump faces is whether to challenge Mr. Putin. The Russian
leader’s demands for a peace agreement include things that Mr. Zelensky could
never sell to his people, such as recognition of Russian control over five occupied
Ukrainian regions and an end to Western military support for Ukraine. While Mr.
Trump has shown a willingness to make big concessions to Mr. Putin, including by
recognizing Russian control over the Crimean Peninsula that Moscow forcibly
annexed in 2014, he has indicated that Mr. Putin is asking too much.
After another recent Russian missile barrage into civilian areas, Mr. Trump wrote
on social media on Saturday of Mr. Putin that “maybe he doesn’t want to stop the
war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently.”
Mr. Trump even threatened to escalate U.S. economic pressure on Russia, including
by introducing “secondary” sanctions that would penalize countries that trade with
Moscow. (Targets could include China and India, which have increased their
purchases of Russian oil in recent years.)
Mr. Trump’s “irritation and impatience and even frustration with Putin is way up,”
said William B. Taylor Jr., who served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to
2009.
Mr. Trump may now be less “star-struck” by the Russian leader than he was in his
first term, Mr. Taylor said, and therefore more willing to challenge him.
“I think Trump is in a stronger position now vis-à-vis Putin than he was in his first
term. Putin is diminished,” Mr. Taylor said. He added: “He’s now the junior partner
to the Chinese. His economy is in very bad shape.” (Mr. Taylor also served as the
senior U.S. diplomat in Kyiv during Mr. Trump’s first term.)
Mr. Trump has sought Mr. Putin’s favor for years, publicly excusing his military
aggression. Doug Mills/The New York Times
A close Trump ally in Congress, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, says
he will soon have a veto-proof majority for a bill to impose new sanctions on Russia
and tariffs on consumers of its energy resources.
As Mr. Putin loses favor, Mr. Zelensky appears to have maneuvered himself out of
the doghouse.
One Ukraine expert added that European leaders, notably including Prime
Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France,
served as “marriage counselors” between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky.
The progress was visible in the impromptu private meeting the men held on the
sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral at the Vatican last weekend, during which they
sat almost knee to knee in a marble rotunda, looking intent but not hostile.
While neither made public the details of their chat, both sides depicted the 15-
minute session as positive, and Ukrainians were buoyed to see Mr. Trump
condemn Russia’s latest attacks on Ukraine shortly afterward.
Analysts also said that Mr. Zelensky successfully negotiated a much better
minerals deal than the one originally presented to his government in February,
which critics called tantamount to extortion.
Mr. Zelensky’s government hopes that, by playing to Mr. Trump’s powerful profit
motive, the minerals deal will give him a new interest in Ukraine’s survival.
Ukraine’s gains on that agreement may portend well for peace talks, said Nataliia
Shapoval, the head of the KSE Institute, a prominent Kyiv think tank. “In the rules
of the game of the Trump team, Ukraine proved itself worthy of negotiations,” she
said.
Still, many Ukraine supporters are tempering their hopes. Mr. Trump has sought
Mr. Putin’s favor for years, publicly excusing his military aggression and even
rejecting widespread charges that Mr. Putin is complicit in corruption, murder and
war crimes.
Should he shy from confronting the Russian leader, Mr. Trump will have another
big decision to make. Vice President JD Vance recently warned that the United
States might “walk away” if the peace negotiations do not progress soon, and Mr.
Trump said in mid-April that he might say, “we’re going to just take a pass.”
It is unclear what that would mean. In a worst-case scenario for Ukraine, Mr.
Trump would declare an end to U.S. aid for Kyiv and give Mr. Putin a green light to
escalate his offensive.
But that presents Mr. Trump with the risk of “losing” Ukraine in what would be a
bloody and chaotic military disaster, one that could dwarf the chaos of the 2021 U.S.
exit from Afghanistan that Mr. Trump calls a national humiliation.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia-zelensky.html
Michael C. Bender,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Funds for K-12 Students Are on the Chopping Block in Trump’s Budget,"President Trump’s budget proposal would shrink the Education Department, which
he has called on Congress to eliminate, by slashing its funding by 15 percent, or $12
billion.
The most significant chunk of that reduction, about $4.5 billion, would come from
K-12 schools. The administration said this reduction would come from a plan to
provide “streamlined, flexible funding to the states” and relieve the federal
government of the responsibility of administering the money and enforcing
compliance. These cuts would not impact Title I funding for low-income schools, an
Education Department spokeswoman said.
Mr. Trump would save $1.6 billion by cutting programs aimed at supporting low-
income students and preparing them for college. The administration said these
programs, known at TRIO and GEAR UP, were “a relic of the past” because access
to college was not “the obstacle it was for students of limited means.”
Other significant cuts come from slashing nearly $1 billion from federal work-study
programs; $910 million from a program for college students with exceptional
financial need; $890 million from services to help immigrant students become
proficient English speakers; $729 million from adult education services; and $315
million from preschool development grants.
The budget proposal also would cut $64 million in funding for Howard University,
the nation’s only federally chartered historically Black college and university.
One corner of the education budget that the Trump administration would like to
boost is charter schools. His budget proposal would increase federal support for
new charter schools by $60 million, or about 8.3 percent.
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the
proposal “cuts much of what helps poor, working-class and middle-class Americans
get ahead.”
“Our concern when the president started dismantling the Department of Education
was not the bureaucracy, but the funding,” Ms. Weingarten said. “And now we
know, he’s actually shortchanging kids. He would gut K-12 programs by $5.4 billion.
Support for student aid is slashed.”
Linda McMahon, the education secretary, said the budget proposal reflected her
mandate to “serve as the final secretary of education.” Closing the Education
Department would require approval from Congress, which has been opposed to
such a move.
“President Trump’s proposed budget puts students and parents above the
bureaucracy,” Ms. McMahon said in a statement. “The federal government has
invested trillions of taxpayer dollars into an education system that is not driving
improved student outcomes. We must change course and reorient taxpayer dollars
toward proven programs that generate results for American students.”
A correction was made on May 2, 2025: An earlier version of this article misstated
where some of the cuts outlined in the government’s budget came from. The most
significant reductions would come from K-12 schools, but not schools designated as
Title I.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-budget-education-cuts.html
Juliet Macur;Jazmine Ulloa;Annie Correal;Kirsten Noyes;Alan Feuer;Dan Barry,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Kilmar Abrego Garcia: The Story of the ‘Mistakenly Deported Maryland Man’,"Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, all of 16, called his older brother in distant
Maryland with startling news. He had made it to the Texas border. He had escaped.
In his family’s telling, this is how his American journey began. They say that for
years in El Salvador, a gang called Barrio 18 had terrorized them, extorting money
from the mother’s small tortilla and pupusa business, threatening to leave them all
dead in a ditch — and targeting young Kilmar, in and out of school, with increasing
menace.
“‘They will appear in black bags,’” his mother said through tears, recalling phone
messages from the gang. “Those were the words they would say.”
Seeing a dim future, the teenager had slipped away to follow the worn, treacherous
path known to so many other migrants before him, including his older brother.
North, across desert and river, into Mexico, and then into the United States.
Over the next dozen years, Mr. Abrego Garcia would call Maryland his home. He
would work in construction. Marry. Help to raise three children, all with special
needs. He would also be repeatedly accused by his wife of verbal and physical
abuse — and be labeled as a gang member by the president of the United States.
The Story of the ‘Mistakenly
Deported Maryland Man’
On March 15, the tumultuous American journey of Mr. Abrego Garcia returned him
to South Texas, in restraints. There, on the tarmac of Harlingen Airport, loomed
three large airplanes bound for El Salvador.
Two were reserved for undocumented immigrants being deported without the
constitutional right to due process, on the allegation that they belonged to a well-
known Venezuelan gang. The third plane was for dozens of other immigrants who,
according to the government, had at least been given the chance to argue their
case in a hearing.
Whatever their past, all the detainees — more than 260 — were being sent by the
Trump administration to a Salvadoran maximum-security prison notorious for its
inhumane conditions.
While captors and captives waited for takeoff, some names fell from the third
plane’s manifest for various reasons, and Mr. Abrego Garcia’s name was added.
This was a mistake — a perverse upgrade.
Six years earlier, a federal immigration judge had expressly prohibited the
government from returning Mr. Abrego Garcia to his native El Salvador, where
gang activity might still pose a threat to his life. Yet here he was, in a Kafkaesque
twist, being sent back in chains to that very country.
The reason: the Trump administration’s assertion that he was part of a Salvadoran-
American criminal gang called MS-13 — an assertion based partly on his clothes
and tattoos.
The New York Times conducted nearly two dozen interviews in Maryland and El
Salvador, and reviewed court documents and recordings in several jurisdictions, to
construct a fuller portrait of Mr. Abrego Garcia. A sheet metal worker with no
criminal record but brushes with law enforcement, he has become an avatar for
both sides of a roiling American debate: those who support the lengths taken by
President Trump to crack down on illegal immigration; and those who believe his
efforts amount to cruel and Constitution-defying overreach.
Whether Mr. Abrego is an MS-13 gang member — as, with equal vehemence, the
Trump administration insists and his family denies — remains unclear.
“Perhaps, but perhaps not,” wrote Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a conservative
jurist on a federal appeals court in Virginia, pondering whether Mr. Abrego Garcia
was a gang member.
“Regardless, he is still entitled to due process.”
On the tarmac in Harlingen, an Airbus A320 began to hum and whine. Just three
days earlier, Mr. Abrego Garcia was driving in suburban Maryland, his 5-year-old
disabled son secure in a car seat in the back, when an officer pulled him over for
what seemed like a routine traffic stop.
Now he was the one restrained in a seat, on an airplane separating from American
soil as the sun began to set in the clear Texas sky.
El Salvador to Home Depot
Mr. Abrego Garcia spent most of his childhood in Los Nogales, a working-class neighborhood on the edge

The working-class neighborhood of Los Nogales, on the hilly edge of San Salvador,
is modest but inviting, the vibrant colors of its cinder-block homes heightened by
bougainvillea and lush gardens of potted plants. It was here that Mr. Abrego Garcia
lost the puckishness of boyhood to the constant threat of gang violence.
He was born in 1995 to Armando Abrego, a former soldier and police officer who
drove a taxi, and Cecilia Garcia de Abrego, who sold homemade tortillas and
pupusas — thick, stuffed flatbreads — from the garage of their narrow, two-
bedroom home. Neighbors remember Kilmar, the youngest of the couple’s four
children, as a soccer-loving scamp who enjoyed stirring things up: ringing
doorbells and running away, talking fresh to elders, getting into scraps.
“Honestly, yes, he was very mischievous,” recalled a close childhood friend named
Carlos, who asked that his full name not be used for fears about his safety. “But it
was never like — I mean, whether he did things with good or bad intentions, I
couldn’t really say. But I do know he liked to play pranks and that he liked to stir up
trouble.”
The friend’s mother, who also asked that her name be withheld for safety reasons,
said that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s antics sometimes went too far, prompting the parents
of other children to march up to his mother’s tortillería to demand that the child be
reined in.
“He was a restless child,” said Blanca Galdamez, a next-door neighbor. “I consider
him to have been a normal child.”
Mr. Abrego Garcia’s mother agreed. During a recent interview, she smiled when
recalling how he and his siblings helped the family business by buying supplies and
making deliveries. “We sold pupusas four days out of the week and tortillas seven
days a week,” Ms. de Abrego recalled. “He collaborated in that.”
But the rise of criminal gangs had begun to color everyday Salvadoran life, with
the grisly aftermath of their violence vividly portrayed on the nightly news.
Residents of Los Nogales say they were mostly spared, with no graffiti to mark
their neighborhood as the territory of MS-13 or Barrio 18. But schools around the
city, including Kilmar’s, were becoming hotbeds of gang violence.
Cesar Abrego Garcia, Kilmar’s older brother, said he could feel the violence closing
in. He headed north into Mexico and, eventually, the United States.
“It was tough to leave my siblings, my family, to be here alone,” said Cesar, who is
now an American citizen and a licensed electrician in Maryland. “But I believe it
was worth it because I could say that maybe I would even be dead if I had stayed.”
In his phone calls back home, Cesar said, he would hear that Barrio 18 was
extorting money from the family’s pupusa business and targeting his younger
brother.
“They had to disconnect the phone,” he said.
One day in 2011 or 2012, Kilmar began his daunting journey to the United States,
probably with the help of paid smugglers. Before long he made his way to Prince
George’s County in Maryland, joining the ranks of undocumented laborers who, out
of necessity, become jacks-of-all-trades, working in construction, remodeling
homes and repairing air-conditioning systems.
They find these jobs through relatives, or word of mouth, or by mustering at
designated gathering spots — the parking lot, say, of a Home Depot.
Special status granted
From left, Cecilia Garcia de Abrego, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s mother; Cesar Abrego Garcia, his brother; and

By 2016, life had given Jennifer Vasquez a lot to handle. Born and raised in Fairfax,
Va., she was 20 years old, working at a chiropractor’s office, emerging from an
abusive relationship and raising two young children who required a lot of attention
and care. Her 2-year-old daughter had epilepsy, and her 1-year-old son had autism.
Then a friend at work introduced her to a young laborer named Kilmar Abrego
Garcia. It took a couple of years, but finally, in 2018, they had their first date during
their work breaks. They ate lunch in his car, at the construction site where he was
toiling. He opened a bag and pulled out two juice boxes for them — and two
lollipops for her children.
“An instant spark,” she said.
After a few months, they were living together. Recalling how Mr. Abrego Garcia ran
errands, did school pickups and attended to her seizure-prone daughter, Ms.
Vasquez said, “I’ve always said that blood doesn’t define family.”
But this new, cobbled-together family faced challenges. In August 2018, Ms.
Vasquez’s former partner, a construction worker named Edwin Trejo Ramos, filed a
court motion seeking immediate custody of their two children, claiming in part that
they were in danger because she was “dating a gang member.”
A judge deemed the matter not an emergency, and the case was later dismissed, in
early 2019. In November of that year, Mr. Ramos was charged with raping a 13-
year-old girl. He was eventually convicted and sentenced to prison.
Ms. Vasquez learned that she and Mr. Abrego Garcia would be having a child, and
her pregnancy carried high medical risk. With constant appointments and weekly
injections, she said, her partner urged her to rest as much as possible while “he
would do whatever he could to pay our bills.”
That is what Mr. Abrego Garcia was trying to do on March 28, 2019. After driving
his pregnant girlfriend to her job, he stood with three other men in a spot
designated for day laborers outside a Home Depot in the Washington suburb of
Hyattsville, Md., where the sides of trucks in the parking lot say, “Rent Me Starting
at $19.” He was hoping to be hired for the day, motivated in part by the image on his
phone: a sonogram image of his yet-to-be-born child, who he had just learned was
a boy.
A man approached the laborers as they chatted, but he was not a contractor
looking to hire; instead, he was a Hyattsville police officer who thought they were
loitering. Two of the men, neither of them Mr. Abrego Garcia, tossed plastic bottles
containing marijuana under a parked vehicle.
On March 28, 2019, Mr. Abrego Garcia was detained outside a Home Depot in the Washington suburb of

All four men were handcuffed and taken to the Hyattsville station of the Prince
George’s County Police Department for interviews. An officer with experience
investigating gangs identified one man as “Bimbo,” a member of the MS-13 Sailors
clique with an extensive criminal history, and a second man as another gang
member called “Maniaco.” As for the third man, the officers “were unable to
determine his gang affiliation” and “he was sent on his way,” according to a police
report labeled “Gang Field Interview Sheet.”
That left Mr. Abrego Garcia, who was described as 5-foot-7, about 200 pounds, with
short hair and a beard. He wore a Chicago Bulls hat and a hooded sweatshirt with a
depiction of “rolls of money covering the eyes, ears and mouth of the presidents on
the separate denominations.”
The report asserted that the outfit was “indicative of the Hispanic gang culture,”
and that the Bulls hat represented “a member in good standing with the MS-13.” In
addition, it said, a reliable, unnamed source had identified Mr. Abrego Garcia as a
member of MS-13’s Westerns clique who was known as “Chele.”
Mr. Abrego Garcia admitted to being in the United States without proper
documentation, but fiercely denied gang membership; indeed, he had no record
beyond several traffic infractions. What’s more, MS-13’s Westerns clique operates
from the Long Island town of Brentwood, but his lawyers would later say he had
never lived in New York State. As for the sweatshirt, which depicted rolls of money
and the face of Benjamin Franklin — not presidents, as the police report said — Ms.
Vasquez would later say she bought it for her boyfriend after seeing the design on
Fashion Nova, a clothing website.
The report and one of its authors would have other problems. For one, the report
indicated that Mr. Abrego Garcia was being detained in connection with a murder
investigation — a reference made nowhere else and never again. For another, a
gang unit officer involved in the encounter, Ivan Mendez, would be suspended days
later and eventually fired; he would later plead guilty to misconduct after
admitting to providing confidential information to a woman whom he paid for sex.
Ms. Vasquez spent that night panicking, not knowing why Mr. Abrego Garcia
hadn’t collected her from work, not knowing where he was or why his phone was
turned off. But the next morning, he called with an explanation: He was now in the
custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The couple found themselves in the hell of uncertainty. She was dealing with her
risky pregnancy, caring for two children with special needs, trying to keep things
together on one income, working as an advocate for her husband and fearing that
their child would not know his father. And he was behind the curling razor wire of a
detention center about 20 miles from home, struggling to prove that he was not a
gang member.
In late June, three months after Mr. Abrego Garcia’s arrest, a wedding ceremony
was held at a venue not featured in bridal brochures: the Howard County
Detention Center in Jessup, Md. There, separated by a glass partition, Ms. Vasquez
and Mr. Abrego Garcia exchanged vows in the presence of a pastor. Unable to touch
each other, they exchanged rings with the help of a corrections officer.

In August, Ms. Vasquez underwent a C-section. Their boy was born with a
congenital ear deformity and, it would later be determined, was autistic and unable
to speak.
The birth came between immigration court proceedings in which Mr. Abrego
Garcia sought to fight his deportation by requesting a humanitarian exception that
would allow him to remain in the United States, citing the gang harassment of his
family in El Salvador. The government argued he should be denied that bid because
of his suspected gang membership.
Lucia Curiel, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyer at the time, recalled that the government
presented a particularly aggressive case against her client. His hearing lasted two
days over several months, when similar proceedings usually take only a few hours.
Nevertheless, he prevailed, with the immigration judge granting him a special
status, “withholding from removal,” that indefinitely prohibited the government
from deporting him to El Salvador.
“The judge would not have found him credible or granted any relief if he had
believed Kilmar was a gang member,” Ms. Curiel said.
For now, at least, Mr. Abrego Garcia was free to go.
Seeking protective orders
In a storybook world, Mr. Abrego Garcia would simply return to Prince George’s
County, never again to draw the attention of law enforcement. He would blend into
the multiracial fabric of the county, where more than half the residents are African
American and a quarter are Hispanic or Latino. In some neighborhoods, street
vendors set up stands to sell rolled tortilla chips, papas fritas or flavored ices.
But life for Mr. Abrego Garcia continued to be fraught.
Released from detention after seven months, he held his infant son for the first
time, became emotional when he reunited with the two older children and,
gradually, returned to the daily challenges of work and family. But his wife said his
incarceration had changed him.
“Once he came out, maybe like a month after he was out, he changed a lot with me
and my kids, and my other two kids,” Ms. Vasquez told a Maryland judge in 2020.
“Like, he would yell at them and me for anything. Any little thing, it would bother
him.”
He also became short-tempered and violent, according to court documents from
two protective orders sought by his wife, as well as audio recordings of her court
appearances obtained by The Times. One month after Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release,
according to those documents and recordings, he began to physically abuse Ms.
Vasquez, prompting her to fill out paperwork to secure a protective order against
him that December. But, as she told a judge in 2020, she never showed up for court
in that case, testifying that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s family had persuaded her not to
follow through with it.
But the abuse continued into 2020, she said in testimony and in court records. Mr.
Abrego Garcia was kicking her, shoving her, grabbing her hair, slapping her and
making everyone in the house afraid, she said.
Jennifer Vasquez sought a protective order in 2020.
“Also, he breaks, like, everything in the house,” Ms. Vasquez told a district court
judge in August 2020, according to the audio recordings, when the judge asked for
more evidence of the abuse. “That’s the first thing that my son told the officer: ‘Can
you please tell him not to break anything?’”
Ms. Vasquez noted that her husband “does use drugs,” but that he had no access to
firearms.
The judge granted a temporary protective order, ruling that Mr. Abrego Garcia
have no contact with Ms. Vasquez and the children, not abuse or harass them, and
move out of their home until the hearing for the final protective order. The judge
also gave Ms. Vasquez custody of the couple’s 11-month-old son.
Eight days later, Ms. Vasquez filed to rescind the order, saying that Mr. Abrego
Garcia’s family wanted him to be part of their son’s first birthday celebration and
that he had agreed to continue counseling. She did not appear for a subsequent
hearing, held in late September, and her petition for a protective order was
dismissed.
Less than a year later, Ms. Vasquez filled out another request for a protective order
against her husband. In that document, she described an incident in May 2021 in
which Mr. Abrego Garcia punched her and scratched her left eye and, later that
day, tore her clothes off and grabbed her arm so hard he left marks. But a month
later she again failed to appear for a hearing, and the matter was dropped.
When asked last week about her reports of domestic violence several years ago,
Ms. Vasquez said that she and her husband had gone through “a rough patch”
driven by the trauma of his protracted detention, but had overcome that difficult
time through counseling.
“We closed that chapter,” Ms. Vasquez said. “We were mature enough to look for
help.”
Mr. Abrego Garcia’s American life went on. The trepidation known to
undocumented immigrants remained ever-present, the occasional encounters with
law enforcement not at an end.
Ms. Vasquez filled out another request for a protective order against her husband in 2021.
According to records released last month by the Department of Homeland Security,
Mr. Abrego Garcia notified immigration officials in late October 2022 that he
wanted to move to Houston to be closer to his parents. Just five weeks later, he was
driving back to Maryland — with eight passengers — when a highway patrol
officer in Tennessee pulled him over for speeding.
In Homeland Security’s version of the trooper’s account, Mr. Abrego Garcia
explained that he had left Houston three days earlier and was transporting people
in his boss’s car to work in construction in Maryland. But there was no luggage,
and the passengers all gave Mr. Abrego Garcia’s home address as their own —
leading one officer to suspect the possibility of human trafficking.
In the end, Mr. Abrego Garcia was let off with a warning citation for driving with an
expired license.
Back in Maryland, the couple rose most weekdays at 4:30 in the morning. A union
member, he would join his sheet metal crew by 5:30 a.m., all the while hoping that
the five-year apprenticeship program he was in would lead to advancement and
better pay. She would drop the children at school before working the front desk at a
dentistry office. He would pick the children up in the afternoon and help with
homework and activities while she prepared dinner. There were soccer games,
dance practices, weekend takeout dinners and the occasional outing on Cesar
Abrego Garcia’s boat.
Particular care was given to the youngest, nonverbal, child. Because loud noise
would unsettle the boy, Mr. Abrego Garcia did his best to secure doors and
soundproof rooms, his wife said, and he watched YouTube tutorials for tips on how
to keep his family safe.
The drive home
The afternoon of Wednesday, March 12, carried the promise of spring, with few
clouds and a temperature in the mid-60s. Mr. Abrego Garcia was headed home, his
work shift ended, his 5-year-old son in the back seat of his vehicle, secured in a car
seat designed for children with disabilities.
But while he drove along Baltimore Avenue in the Maryland suburb of College
Park, Mr. Abrego Garcia was told to pull over by a law enforcement officer. He
turned into the parking lot of an Ikea and stopped outside a Buffalo Wild Wings
restaurant.
As this was happening, Mr. Abrego Garcia called his wife, who told him to put her
on speaker phone. She heard someone tell him to turn the engine off and step out of
the car. She heard her husband say that he had a son with special needs in the back
seat. She heard the officer hang up her husband’s phone.
Minutes later, someone saying they were with the Department of Homeland
Security called Ms. Vasquez to inform her that she had 10 minutes to collect her
son, or child protective services would be contacted.
She arrived a few minutes later to find her crying 5-year-old still strapped in his
car seat and her husband sitting on a curb, his hands cuffed behind him. He was in
a fluorescent yellow safety shirt that workers wear on construction sites.
The only explanation the distraught Ms. Vasquez received was that her husband’s
“immigration status had changed.”
In the moment, it was unclear why a sheet metal worker with a child in the back
seat of his car had been pulled over and handcuffed. But it came at a time when
federal immigration agents were scrambling under pressure from the White House
to meet one of President Trump’s more audacious political promises: to deport as
many as one million immigrants from the United States in his first year in office.
Mr. Abrego Garcia called his wife that night from a detention center in Baltimore,
and the questions he said he had been asked suggested that immigration agents
had had him in their sights. They asked about his family’s visits to Don Ramon, a
restaurant in Silver Spring that specializes in Mexican and Salvadoran food. They
asked about a photo they had of him playing basketball with others at a local court.
Who were those people?
And they accused him of being in MS-13 — a false, inflammatory allegation, his
wife said, that she and her husband had thought was well behind them.
Due process
Protesters at the U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Md., for a hearing on the deportation of Mr. Abrego

In the days ahead, as outrage grew over the deportation of hundreds to a
Salvadoran prison system notorious for human rights violations, Mr. Abrego Garcia
would be widely referred to in headlines around the world as the “mistakenly
deported Maryland man.” Although much about him remains unknown, he came to
personify the Trump administration’s determination to rid the United States of
illegal immigrants — in part by defying the protection enshrined in the U.S.
Constitution, that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without the
due process of law.
“The judicial process is for Americans,” Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s homeland
security adviser, would say in a social media post. “Immediate deportation is for
illegal aliens.”
The federal government would admit its mistake in deporting Mr. Abrego Garcia,
whose whereabouts in the Salvadoran prison system have become unclear, yet
resist doing much to correct that mistake. Instead, the government would double
down on its assertion that he was a gang member.
Mr. Trump would display a digitally altered photo of Mr. Abrego Garcia’s tattooed
hands as proof. Vice President JD Vance would erroneously call him a convicted
gang member. A top homeland security official would falsely say in a social media
post that he had been “found with rolls of cash and drugs.” Homeland Security
would release what it would call a “bombshell” report on the “Kilmar Abrego
Garcia suspected human trafficking incident” — in reference to the Tennessee
traffic stop.
Ms. Vasquez, meanwhile, would share the devastating effect on their family — how
their youngest child sought comfort in the scent of his absent father’s work shirts
— as their lawyers fought for Mr. Abrego Garcia’s return in various courts.
Ultimately, the Supreme Court would rule that the White House must take steps to
“facilitate” his release from Salvadoran custody.
The White House would stonewall, prompting Paula Xinis, a federal judge in
Maryland, to begin an inquiry into whether the administration had willfully
violated her orders. But she would pause the proceedings at the government’s
request after a cryptic Justice Department filing that referred to “diplomatic
discussions” between the State Department and El Salvador.
Throughout, no one in the Trump administration would seem willing or able to
answer the basic question posed by Judge Wilkinson: “The government has
conceded that Abrego Garcia was wrongly or ‘mistakenly’ deported. Why then
should it not make what was wrong, right?”
All this would transform Mr. Abrego Garcia into a complicated symbol, an
international figure representing the unease and uncertainty in the United States
in 2025.
For now, though, he was just a man sitting on a curb, the afternoon sun on his face.
Handcuffed and crying, he was a mile from his American home, and three days
from being sent in shackles to the home country he thought he had left for good.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/abrego-garcia-mistakenly-deported.html
Jenna Russell,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Here’s What Happened in Karen Read’s Murder Trial This Week,"A cellphone data analyst and a close friend of the victim testified this week in the
high-profile retrial of Karen Read, the Massachusetts woman charged with killing
her boyfriend, a Boston police officer, in January 2022.
The judge in the case declared a mistrial last July when jurors could not agree on a
verdict. The retrial is unfolding in the same courthouse in Dedham, south of
Boston.
Prosecutors say that Ms. Read, 45, intentionally backed her car into Officer John
O’Keefe and killed him after a night out drinking with friends. Defense lawyers
argued in the first trial that after Ms. Read dropped Officer O’Keefe off at a party
late that night in suburban Canton, Mass., at the home of another Boston police
officer, he was beaten and left for dead in the front yard during a raging blizzard.
Ms. Read has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder,
manslaughter while operating under the influence of alcohol, and leaving the scene
of an accident causing death.
The defense contends that she is the victim of a corrupt and incompetent
investigation by law enforcement officials who conspired to frame her for the
murder.
Cellphone data is disputed
A digital forensics expert, Ian Whiffin, testified this week about his analysis of data
from the Officer O’Keefe’s cellphone, which was found beneath his body. Based on
the data, Mr. Whiffin said, he believes that the phone was in the yard of the home
where the party was held from 12:30 a.m. on Jan. 29, when Ms. Read dropped off
Officer O’Keefe there, until 6 a.m. that morning, when his body was discovered in
the snow.
That testimony suggests that the officer did not go inside the house that night,
supporting the prosecution’s argument that Ms. Read hit and killed him with her
car.
But lawyers for Ms. Read challenged Mr. Whiffin’s analysis of the phone data,
questioning whether it was really possible to determine with certainty whether the
phone was on the lawn or a short distance away, inside the house.
Mr. Whiffin also addressed the timing of a hotly contested Google search in the
early hours of Jan. 29, by a friend of Officer O’Keefe and Ms. Read who attended
the party, asking “ho[w] long to die in cold.” He said the online search was not
conducted at 2:27 a.m., as a time stamp indicates, but later that morning, around
when Officer O’Keefe’s body was discovered.
Defense lawyers have maintained that the Google search happened at 2:27 a.m.,
when the friend opened the search window, and that it showed that the people at
the party had conspired to abandon the injured police officer. Officer O’Keefe’s
cause of death was head trauma and hypothermia.
Who is Jennifer McCabe?
Jurors this week heard several days of testimony from Jennifer McCabe, a friend of
Officer O’Keefe and Ms. Read’s who was at the bar with them that night. Ms.
McCabe also attended the house party that followed and was present at 6 a.m. on
Jan. 29, when Ms. Read returned to the home and discovered the body on the lawn.
In her testimony, Ms. McCabe described receiving a hysterical phone call from Ms.
Read around 5 a.m. saying that Officer O’Keefe had never come home the previous
night. She recounted Ms. Read asking, “Did I hit him?”
She drove Ms. Read back to the home in Canton where the party had been held, she
said, and Ms. Read continued to question whether she could have hit Officer
O’Keefe after dropping him off. Ms. Read also showed Ms. McCabe and another
friend a crack in the taillight of her black Lexus S.U.V., Ms. McCabe testified.
Defense lawyers pressed Ms. McCabe on precisely what Ms. Read said that
morning, and whether she had asked, “Did I hit him?” or said, “I hit him.”
Ms. McCabe said in court this week that her memory of Ms. Read saying “I hit him,
I hit him” that morning remains “as fresh today” as it was three years ago.
The couple’s relationship was fraying
In testimony last week, a state police trooper read text messages exchanged by
Ms. Read and Officer O’Keefe the day before he died that revealed growing tension
in their relationship.
“Things haven’t been great between us for a while,” Officer O’Keefe wrote to Ms.
Read. She replied, “So you’re not into it anymore. That’s fine, but I don’t want to
keep trying and have you keep treating me like this.”
A local paramedic who responded to the scene after Officer O’Keefe’s body was
discovered testified that a distraught Ms. Read had expressed despair about
arguing with her boyfriend in their last interaction.
Ms. Read did not testify in her first trial, but her own descriptions of the night her
boyfriend died may be a factor in the retrial. Prosecutors have said they plan to
introduce statements she made in magazine articles and documentaries after the
mistrial last summer.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/karen-read-murder-trial-

Catie Edmondson,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump’s Budget Proposal Falls Flat With Some Key Republicans in Congress,"President Trump’s budget drew harsh criticism on Friday from a trio of powerful
Republican senators, who rejected what they said were woefully inadequate
resources for the military, and suggested they would ignore his plan and ensure
that Congress provided far more money for their priorities.
In separate statements, the senior Republicans — Senators Roger Wicker of
Mississippi, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee; Susan Collins of
Maine, the chairwoman of the appropriations committee; and Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky, the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on defense —
expressed their disdain for Mr. Trump’s proposal.
Their collective pushback amounted to a rare moment of defiance at a time when
Republicans on Capitol Hill have done little to fend off the White House’s efforts to
slash federal programs.
Mr. Wicker said the administration’s proposed military spending levels would
“shred to the bone our military capabilities and our support to service members.”
“President Trump successfully campaigned on a Peace Through Strength agenda,
but his advisers at the Office of Management and Budget were apparently not
listening,” Mr. Wicker said. He said that Mr. Trump’s budget would effectively
flatline military funding for the fifth straight year, “which is a cut in real terms.”
Congressional Republicans are planning on approving roughly $150 billion in new
defense spending through their sprawling tax cuts legislation. It is meant for
specific new projects — not as a general-use boost to the Pentagon’s budget. In
their budget request, administration officials factored in that money, and made the
case that they planned to increase military spending by 13 percent.
Hawkish Republicans on Capitol Hill view that gambit as an accounting gimmick,
and want to see military spending levels raised through the regular appropriations
process.
“Make no mistake: A one-time influx reconciliation spending is not a substitute for
full-year appropriations,” Mr. McConnell said. “It’s a supplement.”
Ms. Collins, who called the budget proposal “late” and lacking in important details,
nonetheless made it clear she did not approve.
After a preliminary review, she said, she had “serious objections” to the defense
portion. And she criticized Mr. Trump’s plan to gut or eliminate domestic programs
including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps to offset
high utility bills for low-income people across the country; another that provides
federal educational services to students from disadvantaged backgrounds; and
others that support biomedical research.
“Ultimately,” she noted in her statement, “it is Congress that holds the power of the
purse.”
Mr. McConnell also noted in his statement that only Congress could set and
approve federal spending levels, and that lawmakers often disregard the numbers
laid out in the president’s budget request.
“America cannot expect our allies to heed calls for greater annual defense spending
if we are unwilling to lead by example,” Mr. McConnell, the former Republican
leader, said. “Fortunately, presidential budget requests are just that: requests.
Congress will soon have an opportunity to ensure that American power — and the
credibility of our commitments — are appropriately resourced. I hope and expect
that my colleagues will join me in placing America’s national security first.”
Many Republicans cheered Mr. Trump’s budget, which Speaker Mike Johnson
called a “bold blueprint that reflects the values of hardworking Americans and the
commitment to American strength and prosperity.”
But the dissent from some Republican lawmakers in both chambers was notable at
a time when few of them have spoken out about any of the president’s moves.
Representative Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, called the cut to the Low
Income Home Energy Assistance Program “reckless,” and said it would leave his
constituents “out in the cold.”
Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the
Armed Services Committee, said he was “very concerned the requested base
budget for defense does not reflect a realistic path to building the military
capability we need to achieve President Trump’s Peace Through Strength agenda.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-budget-congress-republicans.html
Robert D. McFadden,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,"George Ryan, Illinois Governor Who Halted Prison Executions, Dies at 91","George H. Ryan, the Illinois governor who reopened a national debate over capital
punishment in 2000 by imposing a moratorium on death-row executions in his
state, and who later went to prison for taking bribes in an earlier role as the Illinois
secretary of state, died on Friday at his home in Kankakee, Ill. He was 91.
His death was confirmed by his son, George H. Ryan Jr.
Citing “a shameless record of convicting innocent people and putting them on
death row,” Governor Ryan, a moderate Republican who, like most Americans, had
long favored capital punishment, defended his decision to suspend the death
penalty in Illinois on Jan. 31 as an act of conscience.
Barely a year into his single four-year term, Mr. Ryan said that since 1977, when
the Illinois death penalty was reinstated after a federal pause, the state’s capital
punishment system had been rife with grievous error. Of 25 inmates who had been
placed on death row in that time, he said, 12 had been executed but 13 had been
sent there for crimes they did not commit and were later exonerated and released.
“I cannot support a system which in its administration has proved so fraught with
error, and has come so close to the ultimate nightmare, the state’s taking of
innocent life,” he said.
He added, “Until I can be sure that everyone sentenced to death in Illinois is truly
guilty, until I can be sure with moral certainty that no innocent man or woman is
facing a lethal injection, no one will meet that fate.”
The moratorium was hailed by opponents of capital punishment, who said that
wrongful death-penalty cases were common in America, often corrupted by issues
of race, poverty, bad lawyering and police or prosecutorial misconduct.
Contemporary research has suggested that 70 percent of fully reviewed capital
cases contain reversible errors.
But Mr. Ryan’s blanket commutation was questioned by conservative law-and-
order groups and by families and friends of victims slain by people who ultimately
landed on death row. Many said the moratorium amounted to a killers’ reprieve
granted by a governor capriciously overturning settled court decisions.
Mr. Ryan, however, insisted that his moratorium was an act of conscience based on
statistical evidence that people on death row in Illinois — guilty or not — were
likely to be executed. He found himself in a media spotlight, being compared to his
fellow Republican Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who had presided over 135
executions in five years in office and who was running for president at the time.
An editorial in The New York Times, titled “Governor Ryan’s Brave Example,”
said: “Mr. Ryan has made it politically acceptable for conservative Republicans
and Democrats alike to rethink capital punishment and how it is carried out. Many
politicians have avoided the issue for fear of being called soft on crime.”

was re-elected governor and Mr. Ryan was elected lieutenant governor. He would
serve until 1991. Bettmann, via Getty Images
Mr. Ryan was not the first governor to commute death-row sentences. After losing
a 1970 re-election bid, Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller of Arkansas, a Republican,
commuted the sentences of 15 condemned inmates; Gov. Toney Anaya of New
Mexico, a Democrat, commuted five death sentences before leaving office in 1986;
and Gov. Richard F. Celeste of Ohio, also a Democrat, commuted eight death
sentences before departing in 1991. All opposed the death penalty, but none of their
actions compared in scale with Mr. Ryan’s sweep.

Mr. Ryan named a blue-ribbon commission to re-examine cases that had led to
wrongful convictions. It found that some defense lawyers had been less than
competent, that judges had overlooked trial mistakes, and that death penalty
statutes were a hodgepodge of contradictions needing an overhaul. The panel
proposed reforms, including bans on death sentences for the mentally handicapped
as well as in cases based on the testimony of a jailhouse informant or a single
eyewitness.
Mr. Ryan did not seek re-election in 2002. Some political observers linked his
demurral to a series of recent criminal convictions of former subordinates from his
days as the Illinois secretary of state, and to reports that prosecutors were
examining his conduct while in that position.
Months later, as his term ended, Mr. Ryan pardoned four death-row inmates whose
innocence had been proved by new evidence. He then exercised the ultimate
authority in his arsenal by commuting, to life terms, the death sentences of all 167
inmates still facing execution in Illinois. It was the largest commutation of death-
row sentences in the nation’s history, and it stripped the Illinois death row bare of
inmates.
He announced his decision in a speech before a large audience in a hall at the
Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago.
“I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death,” the governor said, quoting
Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun of the United States Supreme Court. He
added:
“The legislature couldn’t reform it. Lawmakers won’t repeal it. But I will not stand
for it. I must act. Our capital system is haunted by the demon of error, error in
determining guilt, and error in determining who among the guilty deserves to die.”
Mr. Ryan’s attack on capital punishment drew praise from world leaders, including
Pope John Paul II and, in South Africa, former President Nelson Mandela and
Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Mr. Ryan was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.
But history was closing in on him.
The origins of his downfall lay in a decade-old federal corruption investigation
called “Operation Safe Road.” It had uncovered the illegal sale of government
contracts, leases and even driver’s licenses to incompetent truckers, some of whom
were involved in fatal highway crashes. At least 79 people — former subordinates
of Mr. Ryan, lobbyists and others — were implicated and charged with felonies.
Nearly all were convicted and served prison terms.
In 2003, Mr. Ryan spoke to a large gathering at Northwestern University College of Law in Chicago.
During the speech, he announced he was commuting the sentences of all 160 inmates on death row in
Illinois. Jeff Haynes/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images
In 2004, the investigation reached Mr. Ryan: He was accused of accepting $167,000
in cash, vacations and gifts for himself, his family and friends. Indicted on charges
of fraud and racketeering, he was convicted on 18 counts after a five-month trial in
2006 and sentenced to six and a half years in prison, a term spent mostly at a
federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind. He was temporarily released in 2011 to
visit his wife, Lura Lynn Ryan, in a hospital in Kankakee on the day she died of
lung cancer.
Scott Turow, a lawyer, author and member of the commission that Mr. Ryan had
named to review the state’s capital cases, posed a rhetorical question to reporters
about the man who had plumbed the limits of power and disgrace: “Who was
George Ryan?” Mr. Turow asked after the conviction. “It’s a question best put to
Shakespeare.”
George Homer Ryan, the youngest of three children of Thomas and Jeanette
(Bowman) Ryan, was born on Feb. 24, 1934, in Maquoketa, Iowa, where his
mother’s family raised cattle. Months after his birth, his father earned a pharmacy
degree from the University of Iowa and took a job with Walgreens, the drugstore
chain.
After a brief posting at a Walgreens on the South Side of Chicago, Thomas Ryan
was transferred to a store in Kankakee, a small city an hour’s drive south of
Chicago, where the family settled and where George; his sister, Kathleen; and his
brother, Tom, grew up and attended public schools. In 1947, the Ryans adopted 15-
year-old Nancy Schrey after the death of her widowed father, Harry Schrey, a
friend of the family.
In 1948, Thomas Ryan opened his own pharmacy in Kankakee. George, a freshman
at Kankakee High School, worked there on lunch hours and weekends, making
sodas, washing dishes and scrubbing floors. He also found time to play high school
football and baseball.
“I worked the fountain and realized that if I was ever going to be an owner of the
pharmacy, I had to be a pharmacist,” Mr. Ryan told Illinois Periodicals Online for a
profile published in 1998. After graduating from Kankakee High in 1952, he worked
full-time for his father, as did Tom, Kathleen and, after she married, her husband,
Duane Dean. At one point, four Ryan pharmacies in the Kankakee area were
operated by family members.
George was drafted by the Army in 1954. He spent 13 months in Korea, was
discharged in 1956 and returned to the family business. In 1961, he earned a
Bachelor of Science degree in pharmacy from Ferris State College (now Ferris
State University) in Big Rapids, Mich. He and his siblings were co-owners of the
family drugstores until 1990, when the chain was sold.
While Mr. Ryan had his sights on politics, it was his brother, Tom Ryan, who
jumped in first. He was elected mayor of Kankakee in 1965 and held the post for 20
years.
Mr. Ryan began his political career on the Kankakee County board of supervisors
from 1968 to 1973. He was then elected to a seat in the Illinois House of
Representatives, serving from 1973 to 1983, with two terms as minority leader and
one as speaker. Over the next 20 years, he was elected to the state’s highest offices,
as lieutenant governor under Gov. James R. Thompson (1983-91); as a two-term
secretary of state (1991-99); and finally as governor of Illinois (1999-2003).

sitting American governor to meet Mr. Castro there. Jorge Rey/Associated Press
Mr. Ryan defeated a five-term Democratic Illinois congressman, Glenn Poshard,
for the governorship in 1998 with 51 percent of the vote to Mr. Poshard’s 47 percent.
Mr. Ryan’s most ambitious undertaking as governor was a $12 billion effort to
rebuild the state’s roads, schools and transit systems. In 1999, he became the first
sitting American governor to meet President Fidel Castro of Cuba in Havana. The
next year, he was named chairman of the Midwestern Governors Association and
the Illinois chairman of George W. Bush’s campaign for the presidency.
In 1956, he married his high school sweetheart, Lura Lynn Lowe, whose family
owned one of the first hybrid seed companies in the United States.
In addition to his son, Mr. Ryan is survived by five daughters, Julie Koehl, Joanne
Barrow, Jeanette Schneider, Lynda Fairman and Nancy Coghlan; 17 grandchildren;
and 21 great-grandchildren.
The Illinois death penalty was abolished on March 9, 2011, with Gov. Pat Quinn, a
Democrat, signing the legislation. The 15 people then on death row had their

Adam Liptak,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Asks Supreme Court to Let DOGE View Social Security Data,"The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to let members of
Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have access to sensitive
records of the Social Security Administration.
“This emergency application,” D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, wrote, “presents
a now-familiar theme: a district court has issued sweeping injunctive relief without
legal authority to do so, in ways that inflict ongoing, irreparable harm on urgent
federal priorities and stymie the executive branch’s functions.”
The administration has filed a barrage of such applications in recent weeks,
including one in an immigration case on Thursday. Several of them await decisions
from the justices, who are also set to hear arguments on May 15 on the scope of
permissible injunctions in challenges to President Trump’s efforts to do away with
birthright citizenship.
Mr. Trump and his allies have complained bitterly about lower court judges who
have blocked his initiatives, including by issuing injunctions that apply nationwide.
Judge Ellen L. Hollander, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland,
imposed strict conditions last month on access to the records in light of the
agency’s “abiding commitment to the privacy and confidentiality of the personal
information entrusted to it by the American people.”
Judge Hollander said the agency could provide members of the DOGE team “with
access to redacted or anonymized data and records,” but only after they received
training on privacy laws and policies, were subjected to background investigations
and satisfied other requirements.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected the administration’s
request to pause the judge’s injunction while an appeal moved forward.

consequences of the court’s work.”
Learn about how Adam Liptak approaches covering the court.
The Supreme Court ordered the challengers, two labor unions and an advocacy
group, to respond to the administration’s application by May 12.
Mr. Sauer wrote that Judge Hollander, who was appointed by President Barack
Obama, had exceeded her authority. “The district court is forcing the executive
branch,” he wrote, “to stop employees charged with modernizing government
information systems from accessing the data in those systems because, in the
court’s judgment, those employees do not ‘need’ such access.”
He added: “The government cannot eliminate waste and fraud if district courts bar
the very agency personnel with expertise and the designated mission of curtailing
such waste and fraud from performing their jobs.”
In other lawsuits challenging Mr. Musk’s aggressive incursions into government
records, some judges have issued similar orders barring officials from handing
over sensitive data. As President Trump has pursued efforts to deport students and
other foreign nationals, lawyers have argued that agencies’ data systems could be
used to aid a broader immigration crackdown.
In her ruling, Judge Hollander wrote that the “intrusion into the personal affairs of
millions of Americans — absent an adequate explanation for the need to do so — is
not in the public interest,” especially because the agency “has long communicated
to the public its commitment to privacy.”
“To be sure,” she added, “rooting out possible fraud, waste and mismanagement” in
the agency “is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government
can flout the law to do so.”
Mr. Sauer told the justices that Judge Hollander should not be allowed to interfere
in the executive branch’s operations.
“The district court’s flawed injunction,” Mr. Sauer wrote, “forecloses the executive
branch from carrying out the pressing priorities of modernizing government
information systems and ferreting out fraud, waste, and abuse — all at the behest
of plaintiffs who gave their information to the agencies with the knowledge that
other government employees may access their data.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/supreme-court-doge-social-security.html
Tim Balk,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump Administration Settles With Maine to Restore Frozen Funds Over Trans Athlete Feud,"The Trump administration and Maine reached an agreement that restored funding
for schoolchildren, Maine’s attorney general said Friday, part of a feud between the
president and the state’s governor over policies on transgender athletes.
The state’s attorney general, Aaron M. Frey, said his office had withdrawn a lawsuit
it filed in objection to the funding freeze, which had held up around $3 million, he
estimated, and was initiated by the Agriculture Department last month. The federal
dollars, Mr. Frey said in an interview, pay for food preparation in schools and child
care centers, and also assist in feeding disabled adults in congregate settings.
The Agriculture Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for
comment, had said the freeze would not deprive children of food.
The conflict between President Trump and Maine’s governor, Janet Mills, a
Democrat, escalated at an event at the White House in February. Mr. Trump told
Ms. Mills that she had “better comply” with his executive order barring
transgender athletes from participating in women’s and girls’ sports. The governor,
whose state has refused to follow the order, replied, “See you in court.”
The U.S. and Maine Reach Deal to Restore
Funds in Feud on Transgender Athletes
The agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, cited the state’s unwillingness to comply
with the executive order when the federal funds were frozen. She said in a
statement in April that her agency was reviewing grants awarded to Maine by the
Biden administration, casting them as potentially “wasteful, redundant, or
otherwise against the priorities of the Trump Administration.”
Five days later, Mr. Frey filed his lawsuit, saying that the pause was affecting
children and at-risk adults.
“The food doesn’t just buy itself, deliver itself, cook itself,” Mr. Frey said Friday,
adding that the Trump administration had tried to “bully” Maine. “The message
here is if you don’t follow the law and you try to target Maine without relying on
any shred of law to support it, we’re going to have to take you to court.”
The White House deferred comment to the Agriculture Department.
Ms. Mills said in a statement that the Trump administration had made an “unlawful
attempt to freeze critical funding.” But the agreement, she said, will preserve
healthy meals for about 170,000 schoolchildren across Maine.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-maine-funding-

Adam Liptak,NYT,1,US,5/1/2025,Trump Asks Supreme Court to Lift Deportation Protections for Venezuelans,"The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to let it remove
protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants who had been
allowed to remain in the United States without risk of deportation under a program
known as Temporary Protected Status.
In February, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, terminated an 18-
month extension of T.P.S. protection that had been granted to Venezuelans by the
Biden administration. People affected by the change sued, saying that the move
violated administrative procedures and was influenced by racial bias.
In March, Judge Edward M. Chen of the Federal District Court in San Francisco
blocked the administration’s efforts to remove the protections for Venezuelans
while the case moved forward. He said that the plaintiffs had demonstrated they
were likely to succeed in showing that Ms. Noem’s actions were “unauthorized by
law, arbitrary and capricious, and motivated by unconstitutional animus.”
Judge Chen found that terminating the initiative would inflict irreparable harm “on
hundreds of thousands of persons whose lives, families and livelihoods will be
severely disrupted, cost the United States billions in economic activity and injure
public health and safety in communities throughout the United States.”
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the administration’s
request that it pause Judge Chen’s ruling.
The Supreme Court has fielded several other emergency applications involving Mr.
Trump’s aggressive immigration policies. In one, the court ordered the
administration to facilitate the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who had
wrongly been sent to El Salvador, where he remains. In another, the justices
temporarily blocked the removal of some Venezuelan immigrants under the Alien
Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law.
The court is also set to hear arguments on May 15 on the scope of three rulings
blocking an executive order seeking to do away with birthright citizenship.

The Temporary Protected Status program, enacted by Congress and signed into
law by President George H.W. Bush, allows migrants from nations that have
experienced national disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary instability
to live and work legally in the United States.
President Trump has looked to end protections under the program as he seeks to
make good on his campaign promise to deport millions of immigrants from the
United States. His efforts would have terminated them for nearly 350,000 people in
early April, and for hundreds of thousands more later this year.
In the administration’s emergency application, D. John Sauer, the solicitor general,
wrote that the law creating the program specifically barred judicial second-
guessing of the executive branch’s decisions. A provision of the law said that “there
is no judicial review of any determination” concerning “the designation, or
termination or extension of a designation, of a foreign state.”
Judge Chen said that provision did not prohibit him from deciding whether Ms.
Noem was authorized to vacate the protections.
Mr. Sauer also criticized the scope of Judge Chen’s ruling.
“The district court entered nationwide relief supplanting Secretary Noem’s
assessment of the national interest — an area into which a district court is uniquely
unqualified to intrude,” Mr. Sauer wrote. “The court thus wrested control of the
nation’s immigration policy away from the executive branch and imposed the
court’s own perception as to whether the government’s actions might ‘contradict
U.S. foreign policies,’ ‘have adverse national security ramifications’ or ‘weaken the
standing of the United States in the international community,’” he wrote, citing
phrases from the ruling.
Mr. Sauer asked the justices to act promptly. “This court’s immediate attention is
especially warranted,” he wrote, “because protracted litigation will effectively
preclude the president from enforcing a critical component of the administration’s
immigration policy.”
The court ordered the challengers to respond to the application by May 8.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/trump-supreme-court-tps.html
Sheryl Gay Stolberg,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,Trump’s Budget Calls for Deep Cuts to NIH and CDC,"President Trump used his budget blueprint on Friday to forge ahead with his
assault on the nation’s public health and biomedical research enterprise, proposing
draconian cuts to the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention that experts warned would upend decades of progress in
advancing human health, well-being and longevity.
In hard numbers and biting words, the budget wipes out a string of programs,
including one that helps low-income people living in cold climates pay heating bills.
It eliminates C.D.C. programs devoted to preventing chronic disease and injuries,
including gun violence injuries, dismissing those programs as “duplicative” and
“unnecessary.”
It calls the N.I.H., the world’s premier biomedical research agency, “too big and
unfocused.” The document argues that the institutes have “broken the trust of the
American people,” while effectively accusing the agency of funding research that
led to the coronavirus pandemic. It says the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services, the federal agency that provides health care to more than 160 million
Americans, has carried out “wasteful and woke activities.”
Trump’s Budget Calls for Deep Cuts to Public
Health Programs and Research
In some respects, the plan is not surprising; Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy
Jr. has already announced that he is shrinking the federal Department of Health
and Human Services, which oversees the N.I.H. and the C.D.C., by 20,000 people.
The blueprint proposes $500 million for Mr. Kennedy’s Make America Healthy
Again initiative.
Yet the budget proposal takes aim at some initiatives that Mr. Kennedy might seem
to favor. It eliminates the National Center for Complementary and Integrative
Health, which focuses on alternative therapies. And Mr. Kennedy often says he
wants to improve the health of Native Americans, many of whom rely on the home
heating program Mr. Trump wants to cut.
The plan would slash $18 billion out of the N.I.H. budget, shrinking it to $27 billion
— a stark contrast from its heyday in the 1990s, when a bipartisan Congress voted
to double its budget within five years because Republicans argued biomedical
research was an engine for economic growth.
The proposed budget is only a blueprint — a statement of Mr. Trump’s priorities. It
will now go to Congress, where it is already facing hurdles.
Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and the chairwoman of the
Appropriations Committee, said Friday that she had “serious objections” to cuts to
the home heating program, which helps many of her constituents survive the cold
New England winters, and to programs “that support biomedical research.”
Mr. Trump also proposes shutting down the National Institute for Minority and
Health Disparities, a branch of the N.I.H. devoted to studying ways to improve the
health of minorities, including Native Americans, who often suffer higher rates of
chronic disease than white people.
The budget said the institute was “replete with D.E.I. expenditures” — a reference
to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which the president has systematically
moved to dismantle within the government.
“Eliminating these efforts would reverse decades of progress,” said Dr. Thomas R.
Frieden, who ran the C.D.C. under President Barack Obama. “You don’t improve
things by destroying them. You improve them by improving them.”
The budget blueprint does not talk about the Food and Drug Administration. Dr.
David A. Kessler, who ran the F.D.A. under both Republican and Democratic
administrations, has argued that deep cuts to biomedical research funding will put
the United States at a competitive disadvantage with China.
At a recent hearing on Capitol Hill, he reminded lawmakers of the Cold War era,
when the federal government ramped up its investment in research after the
Soviet Union became the first nation to launch a space satellite.
“Whatever needs to be fixed, let’s fix it, but we need to make a marked increase in
our investment,” Dr. Kessler said. ”This is Sputnik 2.0, but with China.
While chronic disease and injuries are now major causes of death in the United
States, the C.D.C.’s scope would be narrowed and would return to its original
mission of protecting Americans against infectious disease. The agency’s budget
would be cut nearly in half; it would lose $3.5 billion in funding, leaving it with
“more than $4 billion,” the proposal said.
Protesters attend a candlelight vigil outside the front entrance of the Centers for

Mary Woolley, the longtime chief executive officer of Research America, an
advocacy group that promotes biomedical research, said the effects of Mr. Trump’s
proposal would be felt over the long term by slowing studies that could lead to
treatments for a range of diseases, including childhood cancer, Alzheimer’s disease
and Lupus, the chronic autoimmune disease.
But she also said there would be short-term effects. Patients are already losing
access to experimental drugs because clinical trials have been shut down as a
result of recent budget cuts, she said. She worried that young researchers would
conclude that “they have no future in this country and should look elsewhere.”
Some are already being recruited by countries, including China, she said, adding,
“If you don’t have the next generation, you have nothing.”
Polls show that most Americans support biomedical research. A recent survey by
KFF found that a majority of the public, 61 percent, opposed major cuts to staff and
spending at federal health agencies. There were stark differences along party lines,
with 9 out of 10 Democrats opposing the cuts, and 72 percent of Republicans
supporting them.
Ms. Woolley cited a recent report by United for Medical Research, a coalition of
patients, advocacy groups, industry and academic medical institutions, that found
N.I.H.-funded research is an economic engine, returning $2.56 for every $1
invested.
Protesters attend a candlelight vigil outside the front entrance of the Centers for

The budget also proposes cutting more than $1 billion from the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration, which directs funds and support
nationwide to address two of the country’s biggest public health crises.
While Mr. Kennedy, a recovering heroin addict, has said he is concerned in
particular about the opioid epidemic, the budget rails against the public health
strategy known as “harm reduction,” which was supported by the Biden
administration and involves decreasing the risk of deaths and overdoses by
ensuring that people who use illicit substances can do so safely.
It specifically criticizes “safe smoking kits” and “syringes.”
The heating program, called the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
was labeled “unnecessary.” The document justified eliminating it by citing Mr.
Trump’s promises to increase domestic oil and gas production and reduce energy
prices.
The Government Accountability Office has raised significant integrity concerns
related to fraud and abuse in the program, but it currently helps 6.2 million
Americans from Texas to Maine offset their high utility bills. Last month, the
administration fired everyone working in the office that administers the program.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-budget-cdc-nih-cuts.html
Michael Levenson,NYT,1,US,5/2/2025,7 Killed in Crash Involving a Tour Van and a Pickup Near Yellowstone,"A pickup truck and a passenger van carrying a tour group collided in Idaho near
Yellowstone National Park on Thursday evening, killing seven people, the Idaho
State Police said. Both of the vehicles caught fire after the crash.
Six of those killed were in the van, a Mercedes, which was carrying 14 people, the
State Police said. The driver of the pickup, a Dodge Ram, was also killed.
The crash happened just before 7:15 p.m. on U.S. Highway 20 near Henry’s Lake, a
popular spot for hiking, biking and fishing in eastern Idaho, about 15 miles from
Yellowstone. The cause was under investigation.
The State Police said that the authorities had summoned an air ambulance and
other air and ground resources to respond to the crash because of the severity of
the injuries.
The Fremont County coroner, Brenda Dye, identified the driver and sole occupant
of the pickup as Isaiah Moreno, 25, of Texas. Ms. Dye said that she was waiting for
the results of DNA testing to identify the six people in the van who were killed,
because the bodies were unrecognizable.
All six were from outside the United States, Ms. Dye said in an interview on Friday.
Two were from Italy, she said, and it wasn’t clear where the other four were from.
They had been part of a group that was touring Yellowstone, she said.
After the crash, two others on the highway jumped out of their vehicle to help, she
said. They were “trying to pull out as many as they could,” from the van, which was
emitting smoke, Ms. Dye said. She said they succeeded in helping eight people out
of the van, including a child, before the van caught fire.
U.S. Highway 20 was closed for nearly seven hours while emergency responders
and the Idaho Transportation Department worked to manage the scene and clear
the roadway, the State Police said.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/yellowstone-tour-van-fatal-

Stocks on Friday erased losses suffered in the days after President Trump’s chaotic
rollout of tariffs in early April, bolstered in part by a healthy report on the labor
market.
The S&P 500 rose 1.5 percent on Friday, climbing back above where it stood before
chaos descended on financial markets after April 2 — Mr. Trump’s so-called
Liberation Day, which featured his most sweeping tariffs to date.
Friday’s boost to stock prices followed a stronger-than-expected report on hiring in
April. But the S&P 500 has been edging higher for days — logging nine consecutive
daily increases — as Mr. Trump and members of his administration raised hopes
that trade tensions would ease, including by indicating they were willing to engage
in talks with China.
Early Friday, China’s commerce ministry said in a statement that it, too, was
considering holding talks with the Trump administration, but only if Washington
canceled its tariffs on Chinese goods first.
The two countries remain far from any deal that would resolve their trade war, but
even the prospect of talks has been enough to ease the worst of the anxiety that
gripped investors a month ago.
“If the labor market holds up and the Trump administration walks back the most
egregious tariffs, the economy could skirt a deep recession,” said Jeffrey Roach,
chief economist at LPL Financial.
Still, despite the recent optimism and recovery, the S&P 500 is more than 7 percent
below its recent high in mid-February. It has fallen about 5 percent since Mr.
Trump’s inauguration in January.
Questions remain about whether Mr. Trump’s tariffs might cause a sharp slowdown
in economic growth, which could result if companies start pulling back on hiring,
spending and investments amid the uncertainty. As they have reported quarterly
earnings in recent days, many companies have said they are struggling to forecast
how the rest of the year will shape up because of the lack of clarity on trade policy.
Several consumer companies have said they’ll have to raise prices — which could
further dent the economy if it discourages spending.
Though Mr. Trump backed off the most extreme tariffs on dozens of countries,
many imports into the United States now face new taxes of at least 10 percent,
while products from China are being taxed a minimum of 145 percent. On Friday, a
provision that had allowed for low-value shipments from mainland China and Hong
Kong to evade tariffs altogether closed. And on Saturday, new tariffs of 25 percent
on imported auto parts are expected to take effect. That’s in addition to a tax of 25
percent on imported cars that already took effect in April.
Volatility in recent weeks has underscored the degree to which sentiment on Wall
Street is still driven by concern about the economic fallout from the Trump
administration’s policies. Mr. Trump’s 90-day pause of many of the tariffs that he
announced on April 2 will end in July.
“The damage to economic momentum has already been done,” said Mike Sanders,
head of fixed income at Madison Investments. “Deals may come, but the real
question is how long the data will take to reflect the harm.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/business/stock-market-recovery-trump-tariffs.html

Officials in the United States are urging Japan and South Korea to make a formal
commitment within the next few weeks to a $44 billion natural gas project in
Alaska.
The effort, known as Alaska L.N.G., is a centerpiece of President Trump’s energy
agenda, and aims to ship gas from northern Alaska in a liquefied form to nations in
Asia. Its feasibility hinges on securing backing from the region, home to some of
the world’s largest purchasers of liquefied natural gas.
A group created by Mr. Trump that is advising him on domestic energy production,
the National Energy Dominance Council, is seeking to convene officials from the
trade ministries of both Japan and South Korea for a summit in Alaska on June 2,
according to three people with knowledge of the confidential outreach who
requested anonymity.
The project’s proponents want to be able to announce at the summit that they have
received signed letters of intent from Japan and South Korea to invest in Alaska
L.N.G. or purchase its gas, the people said. Taiwan formally signed a similar letter
of intent to purchase gas from Alaska L.N.G. last month.
The Japanese and South Korean trade ministries did not respond to requests for
comment. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Energy said Alaska L.N.G. has
the potential to provide energy security for the United States and its allies, as well
as create jobs and reduce the U.S. trade deficit. Mr. Trump and Energy Secretary
Chris Wright “are committed,” he said, to supporting Alaska L.N.G.
Alaska L.N.G., first proposed more than a decade ago, had been considered by
many in the energy industry to be a long shot. But it occupies a prominent spot in
Mr. Trump’s efforts to reshape the U.S. energy landscape and restore momentum
for fossil fuels.

The plan is to construct an 800-mile pipeline from fields north of the Arctic Circle to
southern Alaska. From there, the gas would be cooled into liquid form and shipped
on tankers to Asia.
For Asian countries, shipping L.N.G. from Alaska would be cheaper and quicker
than importing it from many of their traditional sources, including Australia, the
Middle East and the Gulf Coast of the United States.
But major Asian buyers of the fuel, including Japan, have long been cautious about
the Alaska L.N.G. project because of its substantial costs, and doubts that it would
actually be able to get off the ground.
On his first day in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order aimed at
“unleashing” Alaska’s energy potential, including the pipeline proposal.

Japan, South Korea and Taiwan face the possibility of additional double-digit-
percentage tariffs, which have been imposed by Mr. Trump on numerous U.S.
trading partners. Economists have warned that the tariffs, which have been paused
until early July, could severely slow economic growth if they take effect.
Japan, which initiated tariff talks with the United States last week, has indicated
that pledges to purchase more American liquefied natural gas would be a
significant component of its offer to the administration. South Korea has made
similar promises and is set to begin negotiations in Washington on Thursday.
Last month, Taiwan’s state oil and gas company, CPC, signed a letter of intent to
buy six million metric tons of gas from Alaska L.N.G. That would represent almost
a third of the total amount of liquefied natural gas Taiwan imported last year.
Mr. Trump has said he believes that countries in Asia would sign on to support the
Alaska project. During his address to Congress in March, he said Japan and South
Korea wanted to invest “trillions of dollars each” in the project, a statement that
took officials in Tokyo and Seoul by surprise. He did not clarify how the project,
which isn’t expected to begin shipping liquefied gas until the early 2030s, would
receive trillions in investment.
In Japan, and most likely elsewhere, the challenge will be securing private-sector
buyers willing to align with government plans and enter into long-term
agreements to purchase gas from Alaska L.N.G. In Japan, U.S. officials see three
energy companies — Jera, Tokyo Gas and Inpex — as potential customers, two of
the people familiar with the matter said.
Many remain wary of the economics of such a deal. Letters of intent to participate
in the project are likely to include room to withdraw. Alaska L.N.G. says the price of
its gas would be competitive when it begins operations.

Daisuke Wakabayashi,NYT,1,Business,4/25/2025,Uncertainty Over Trump’s Tariffs Paralyzes U.S. Businesses,"Three months ago, things were looking pretty good for Tim Fulton and Ramper
Innovations, a manufacturer of airplane equipment based in Sitka, Alaska.
Mr. Fulton was spending his days inside his workshop doing what he loved:
building the company’s main product — a fold-up conveyor belt that unfurls in the
belly of a plane to load and unload cargo or luggage. He had an order from the U.S.
Air Force that he was confident would serve as a catalyst and bring in new
customers from Asia and the Middle East while luring potential investors.
Then, the tariffs from President Trump struck.
The New York Times heard from Mr. Fulton and hundreds of other American
business owners who said they have been stunned into paralysis by Mr. Trump’s
barrage of tariffs. They are reassessing their product lines and supply chains and
even putting their operations on hold.
‘Things Have Ground to a
Halt’: Tariff Uncertainty
Paralyzes Businesses
Mr. Fulton, 66, was floored at the size of the tariffs and how quickly and chaotically
they were applied. There were tariffs on Mexico and Canada and steel and
aluminum. Mr. Trump hit dozens of countries with higher “reciprocal” tariffs he
then put on hold when financial markets crashed. China struck back and the import
tariff on Chinese goods ratcheted up to 145 percent.
Even though Ramper makes its products in the United States and buys as much of
its components as possible from American companies, there is no getting around
the tariffs. Some essential parts, such as motorized and static rollers from Japan,
are only available overseas. The raw materials needed to build other critical parts
are also imported. Most of Ramper’s U.S. suppliers rely on imports for some part of
their supply chain.
Ramper raised its price 17 percent — a ballpark estimate for how much the tariffs
would inflate its costs. Mr. Fulton also warned prospective customers that he may
need to increase his price further if tariffs pushed  his costs up by more than 5
percent. Prospective customers balked at the higher prices and the uncertainty of
what the final price might be.
After years of refining and testing his foldable conveyor belt, a robust pipeline of
interested buyers disappeared overnight, Mr. Fulton said. Potential investors
turned gun-shy, afraid to plow money into a company at the mercy of arbitrary
tariff policies.
“I feel like things have ground to a halt,” said Mr. Fulton, who started the company
in 2019 after working 38 years as a ramp agent, an airline ground crew member
who loads and unloads baggage.

With no orders to fill, Mr. Fulton rented out his home in Alaska and temporarily
moved to Brazil, where his wife is from, because the cost of living is lower. And
instead of closing deals with investors to raise more money, he is consulting a
bankruptcy lawyer.
Businesses are rushing to cancel factory orders or halt shipping containers before
they leave China, unable to afford the tariff when the ships arrive in America. They
are pausing capital investments and new hiring, and scaling back spending to only
the bare necessities. Future products are being scrapped, because they are no
longer financially viable.

“Everything is stuck and no one knows what to do,” said Kristina Anisimova, who
owns SinoImport USA, a supply chain management firm based in Mooresville, N.
C.
Ms. Anisimova said one-third of her customers, most of whom work primarily with
Chinese factories, are suspending shipping orders, hoping that the tariffs are
eventually eased.
She said the unluckiest companies are the ones whose shipments are already in
transit, because they no longer have the option of delaying or stopping an order.
When their goods arrive in the United States, some of those companies will be
forced to pay twice as much as they had budgeted to take delivery of their
products.
“When you consider a project, you can see what you have to pay. But in this
situation, you cannot predict anything,” said Ms. Anisimova. “And now everything
is on pause.”

Robb Stilnovich, owner of Premier Columbaria, a supplier of cremation memorials
based in Centralia, Wash., said coming off a record year in 2024, his company was
considering remodeling its warehouse to store more inventory and buying a new
forklift. But those plans are now on hold.
Premier Columbaria’s modular granite memorials manufactured in China are now
carrying an import tax of 174 percent, compared to 29 percent last year. He ships 80
to 100 containers a year from China.
Without any certainty in what projects might end up costing, his cemetery
customers are choosing to wait and see how things shake out. His future orders
were down 97 percent compared to a year ago.
He said one prospective customer had agreed to place an order with a 150 percent
markup. Mr. Stilnovich came up with  that number based on what his shipping
company had estimated weeks ago was the maximum tariff that could be applied.
But when the actual rate surged even higher, the customer canceled.
“Everybody just hit pause, and they’re saying ‘Let’s see what happens in six
months,’” said Mr. Stilnovich, 53. “If I am down 97 percent compared to last year, I
can’t stay in business too long.”
He is also worried about how the pause will affect his longtime Chinese factory
partner, who has worked with his company for two decades and has specialized
equipment and know-how critical to producing his products. Mr. Stilnovich said he
was on his way to Xiamen, in southeastern China, to help manage layoffs at that
partner’s factory.
Mr. Stilnovich said he has three containers in transit. He expects to be taxed at 50
percent for two of those containers because they shipped before the latest
escalation in tariffs. For the last one, he expects the shipment to carry a 174 percent
tariff, requiring him to pay $80,000 at the port.

In the workshop, stacks of fabricated frames made of aluminum, a metal subject to tariffs. Mr. Fulton said
he was floored at the size of President Trump’s tariffs and how quickly and chaotically they were applied.

He said exposure to such unforeseen costs is “devastating” to his company, a
family-run operation of 20-plus years. Mr. Stilnovich’s wife takes care of the back
office and his brother handles sales. He said they have inventory and projects lined
up until August, but then things “drop off a cliff.”
Any pause is especially harsh for small businesses with limited cash flow. They are
usually working without much cushion to weather a sudden interruption, and they
have less negotiating power to persuade suppliers to hold orders for an extended
period of time.
For Mr. Fulton of Ramper Innovations, the priority has become working on deals to
maintain some momentum for his company even if the baggage-loading product is
no longer made in the United States. He has an agreement with an Italian company
that will license his product and make it in Europe for sale in European, Middle
Eastern and African markets. He is looking into a similar deal with potential
partners in Thailand or India.
It’s not what he envisioned when he invested his retirement funds into the
company. He wanted to manufacture in America. Specifically he wanted to prove
wrong the naysayers who said making a product in Alaska was crazy.
While Mr. Fulton said he is trying to remain positive and optimistic, he said he is
not sure how the company is going to make it.
“It puts a lump in my heart when I allow myself to think about what’s coming
down,” he said. “There are these places where I might be able to get a finger hold,
but it doesn’t feel like I’m going to be able to pull myself up.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/business/trump-tariffs-american-importers.html
Benjamin Mullin,NYT,1,Business,4/24/2025,Publisher of PCMag and Mashable Sues OpenAI,"Ziff Davis, the digital publisher behind tech sites like Mashable, PCMag and
Lifehacker, sued OpenAI on Thursday, joining a wave of media companies accusing
the artificial intelligence giant of stealing its content.
Ziff Davis is one of the largest publishers in the United States, with more than 45
sites globally that together attract an average of 292 million visitors per month,
and is among the biggest media companies pressing a claim against OpenAI.
(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming
copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies
have denied the suit’s claims.)
In a 62-page complaint filed in federal court in Delaware, where OpenAI is
incorporated, Ziff Davis says the tech company has “intentionally and relentlessly
reproduced exact copies and created derivatives of Ziff Davis works,” infringing on
the publisher’s copyrights and diluting its trademarks. It claims that OpenAI used
Ziff Davis content to train its artificial intelligence models and generate responses
through its popular ChatGPT chatbot.
“OpenAI has taken each of these steps knowing that they violate Ziff Davis’s
intellectual property rights and the law,” the complaint says.
The company is seeking at least hundreds of millions of dollars in its lawsuit,
according to two people familiar with the matter.
A spokesman for OpenAI said in a statement that its models were “grounded in fair
use,” referring to the legal standard for use of copyrighted material.
“ChatGPT helps enhance human creativity, advance scientific discovery and
medical research, and enable hundreds of millions of people to improve their daily
lives,” the statement said.
Many executives in the publishing industry, which was profoundly disrupted by the
widespread adoption of technologies such as search and social media, have
regarded the growing popularity of artificial intelligence with increasing unease.
Powerful A.I. systems built by companies like OpenAI have been trained on
copyrighted content, drawing an outcry from many media companies.
Those companies have generally responded in one of two ways: striking deals to
license their content to companies like OpenAI for millions of dollars, as in the case
with News Corp, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, or filing lawsuits to seek
damages and reaffirm their rights to intellectual property.
Many of those claims are still working their way through courts. This month, a U.S.
judicial panel consolidated several claims against OpenAI, including the one
brought by The Times.
Executives at Ziff Davis have been considering for months which path to take, one
of the people said. The company decided to sue, in part, in the hope that other
publishers would follow.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/business/media/ziff-davis-openai-lawsuit.html

the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate he built into a $1.1
trillion colossus.
By the end of the year, he is preparing to give up that role.
Mr. Buffett said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday that he
plans to ask Berkshire’s board to approve making Gregory Abel, his heir apparent,
the chief executive by the end of the year.
“I would still hang around and conceivably be useful in a few cases,” Mr. Buffett, 94,
told the tens of thousands of Berkshire shareholders at the meeting in Omaha, the
company’s headquarters. But Mr. Abel would have “the final word” when it comes
to the company’s operations, how it invests and more.

Mr. Buffett’s plan — which he said had been known only to two of his children who
sit on the company’s board, Howard and Susan Buffett — was greeted by a minute-
long standing ovation by Berkshire shareholders.
If the board approves the plan, it would mark the end of an era for one of the most
successful companies in modern capitalist history, and one of its most famous
investors. Mr. Buffett has amassed what Forbes estimates is a $168 billion fortune
by being a savvy stock picker, buying up huge companies and assembling a
conglomerate that runs a huge insurance operation, a major railroad, dozens of
consumer companies and oversees a vast stock portfolio.
It has made Mr. Buffett one of the most influential businessmen in the world, giving
his pronouncements on many topics, including politics, great weight. That included
his criticism of President Trump’s trade policies as a mistake: “Trade should not be
a weapon,” Mr. Buffett said. “I don’t think it’s right and I don’t think it’s wise.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/business/berkshire-earnings-warren-buffett.html
Christina Jewett,NYT,1,Business,4/25/2025,F.D.A. Scientists Are Reinstated at Agency Food Safety Labs,"Federal health officials have reversed the decision to fire a few dozen scientists at
the Food and Drug Administration’s food-safety labs, and say they are conducting a
review to determine if other critical posts were cut.
A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the
rehirings and said that several employees would also be restored to the offices that
deal with Freedom of Information requests, an area that was nearly wiped out.
In the last few months, roughly 3,500 F.D.A. jobs, about 20 percent, were
eliminated, representing one of the largest work force reductions among all
government agencies targeted by the Trump administration.
The H.H.S. spokesman said those employees called back had been inadvertently
fired because of inaccurate job classification codes.
The decision to rehire specialists on outbreaks of food-related illnesses and those
who study the safety of products like infant formula follows contradictory
assertions made by Dr. Marty Makary, the F.D.A. commissioner, in media
interviews this week.
“I can tell you there were no cuts to scientists or inspectors,” Dr. Makary said
Wednesday on CNN.
In fact, scientists had been fired from several food and drug safety labs across the
country, including in Puerto Rico, and from the veterinary division where bird flu
safety work was underway. Scientists in the tobacco division who were dismissed
in February — including some who studied the health effects of e-cigarettes —
remain on paid leave and have not been tapped to return, according to employees
who were put on leave.
How many fired employees will be permitted to return remained unclear.
About 40 employees at the Moffett Lab in Chicago and at a San Francisco-area lab
are being offered their jobs back, the department spokesman said. Scientists in
those labs studied a variety of aspects of food safety, from how chemicals and
germs pass through food packaging to methods for keeping bacteria out of infant
formula. Some scientists in Chicago reviewed the work and results of other labs to
ensure that milk and seafood were safe.
Dr. Robert Califf, the F.D.A. commissioner under President Joseph R. Biden, said
the terms “decapitated and eviscerated” seemed fitting to describe the steep loss of
expertise at the agency. He said the F.D.A. was already falling behind on meetings
meant to help companies develop safe products — and to design studies that give
clear answers about their effectiveness.
“Most of it is really at this level of fundamental, day-to-day work that has a huge
impact overall, but it’s not very controversial,” he said. “It’s just that it takes work,
and they have to have people to do the work.”
Dr. Makary has also said the layoffs did not target product reviewers or inspectors.
But their work has been hampered by voluntary departures, the elimination of
support staff and the broader disruption at an agency where many are fleeing for
the exits, according to former staff members.
Hundreds of drug and medical device reviewers, who make up about one-fourth of
the agency work force, have recused themselves from key projects, Dr. Scott
Gottlieb, a former agency commissioner, said on CNBC. Under F.D.A. ethics rules,
staff members who are interviewing for jobs cannot do agency review work on
products by companies where they are seeking employment — or for a competitor.
Dr. Gottlieb also said cuts to the office of generic drug policy wiped out employees
with expertise in determining which brand-name drugs are eligible to be made as
lower-cost generics, calling those job eliminations “profound.” Approving generic
drugs can save consumers billions of dollars.
Support staff for inspectors investigating food and drug plants overseas were also
cut, raising security concerns. Dozens of workers who lost their jobs attended to
security monitoring to ensure that inspectors were safe, especially in hostile
nations.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/health/fda-food-safety-trump-layoffs.html
Jack Ewing,NYT,1,Business,5/3/2025,Car Prices Expected to Rise as Tariffs on Parts Kick In,"The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts on Saturday
that could sharply raise prices for new and used vehicles as well as for repairs and
insurance.
The latest tariffs, which President Trump ordered in March as part of his plan to
promote domestic manufacturing, come after the 25 percent levies on imported
cars that took effect in early April.
This second round of duties on imported parts will have a broader impact because
even cars made in the United States often have engines, transmissions, batteries or
other components produced in other countries.
The administration said on Tuesday that the tariffs were intended “to protect
national security by incentivizing domestic automobile production and reducing
American reliance on imports of foreign automobiles and their parts.”
Want to stay updated on what’s happening in Canada, China and
Mexico? Sign up for Your Places: Global Update, and we’ll send our
latest coverage to your inbox.
The tariffs on parts will not apply to components from Canada or Mexico as long as
those goods meet the requirements of a North American trade agreement
negotiated during Mr. Trump’s first term. Among other things, that deal requires
that a minimum percentage of the content of auto parts come from within North
America.
The administration also said that imported auto parts would not be subjected to
other levies, like the ones on aluminum and steel. And companies that made cars in
the United States would be exempted for two years from having to pay a portion of
the tariffs for imported parts.
Mr. Trump’s tariffs have already pushed up new car prices as customers flocked to
dealerships to buy vehicles before the levies took effect. The tariffs are having a
ripple effect on the used car market as more people look for affordable alternatives
to new cars, increasing demand and prices.

to bring down.
The president has insisted that the tariffs will bring manufacturing back to the
United States. But even if that policy succeeds, consumers will still pay more for
cars. Many goods, including lots of auto parts, can often be made much more
cheaply in China, Mexico or other countries outside the United States.
“A lot of parts, like fasteners, washers, carpet, wiring looms are just not available —
we can’t even buy those parts here,” Jim Farley, the chief executive of Ford Motor,
told CNN this week.
Automakers and suppliers say it will take years for them to relocate assembly
lines. And they are unlikely to commit billions of dollars to domestic manufacturing
because of uncertainty about the direction of trade policy.
Mr. Trump has frequently changed his mind about the size of tariffs and how they
should be applied. On Tuesday, he modified some of the rules to allow automakers
to avoid paying duties on a portion of the components they import for two years.
The measures provide the industry some relief, but car prices will still rise by
thousands of dollars, analysts said.
There will be unpredictable side effects. The financial stress could drive some
suppliers out of business, creating parts shortages.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct
financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
“Auto suppliers are already at thin margins,” said Lenny LaRocca, U.S. automotive
industry leader at the consulting firm KPMG. “They can’t afford the full cost of 25
percent tariffs.”
Mr. Trump’s decision to exempt many parts from Canada and Mexico will, however,
ease the burden on some companies.
The auto industry accounts for about 5 percent of Mexico’s gross domestic product
and employs around one million people in the country. Vehicles and parts are by far
Mexico’s largest exports to the United States.
“Little by little, this haze is clearing up,” Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s economy
minister, said at an event with business leaders and diplomats on Wednesday.
“What we are going to face is a situation that is not as disadvantageous as perhaps
many expected it to be.”
In Canada, however, many parts makers supply car factories in that country, said
Flavio Volpe, the president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association.
And the vehicles those plants make will still be hit with tariffs when they are
exported to the United States.
“The health of the Canadian auto parts sector is that there is a cluster of
manufacturing that we can supply locally,” Mr. Volpe said.
On Friday General Motors said that because of tariffs it was eliminating a third
shift at a pickup truck assembly line in Oshawa, Ontario. That plant will now build
more trucks for Canadians, the company said. Unifor, which represents
autoworkers in Canada, said the reduction would eliminate about 700 union jobs
and was likely to cause parts makers to lay off another 1,200 people.
Prime Minister Mark Carney said that G.M.’s decision was a “terrible
manifestation” of the economic crisis Mr. Trump’s tariffs had created for Canada.
The tariffs will hit some carmakers harder than others. Tesla and Ford are
somewhat less vulnerable. Tesla manufactures all of the cars it sell in the United
States in California and Texas. Ford says that it makes nearly 80 percent of the
vehicles it sells in the United States domestically, including F-series pickups, which
are the best selling vehicles in the country.
General Motors will suffer more, analysts say, because imported parts account for
a large proportion of the value of Chevrolets or Cadillacs made in the United States.
G.M. also imports cars from Canada, Mexico and South Korea. G.M. disputed that
assertion, saying that 80 percent of its parts will be exempt from tariffs.
Volvo Cars, which has a factory in South Carolina but uses many parts from China,
will also be hard hit, analysts say.
Even companies that make vehicles in the United States will feel the pain. Rivian
builds electric pickups in Illinois, but imports batteries from South Korea and
China that will be subject to tariffs.
The tariffs are expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles. Nearly 80
percent of cars priced at less than $30,000 will be subject to 25 percent tariffs,
including popular vehicles like the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Chevrolet Trax,
according to Cox Automotive.
Car prices will probably not skyrocket immediately, because most carmakers and
their dealers have large inventories of cars manufactured before the tariffs took
effect. Ford, Hyundai and Volkswagen are among carmakers that have said they
will not raise prices for several months. But carmakers are not profitable enough to
absorb the increased cost of tariffs indefinitely.
Administration officials continue to discuss tariffs with automakers and the duties
could change. But the uncertainty is creating huge headaches for carmakers. G.M.
said on Thursday that the tariffs would cost it up to $5 billion this year. Other
companies like Stellantis and Mercedes-Benz have told investors they can no
longer make reliable predictions about sales and profit for 2025.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/business/trump-auto-parts-tariffs.html
Natasha Singer,NYT,1,Business,5/2/2025,Google Plans to Roll Out Gemini A.I. Chatbot to Children Under 13,"Google plans to roll out its Gemini artificial intelligence chatbot next week for
children under 13 who have parent-managed Google accounts, as tech companies
vie to attract young users with A.I. products.
“Gemini Apps will soon be available for your child,” the company said in an email
this week to the parent of an 8-year-old. “That means your child will be able to use
Gemini” to ask questions, get homework help and make up stories.
The chatbot will be available to children whose parents use Family Link, a Google
service that enables families to set up Gmail and opt into services like YouTube for
their child. To sign up for a child account, parents provide the tech company with
personal data like their child’s name and birth date.
Gemini has specific guardrails for younger users to hinder the chatbot from
producing certain unsafe content, said Karl Ryan, a Google spokesman. When a
child with a Family Link account uses Gemini, he added, the company will not use

that data to train its A.I.
Introducing Gemini for children could accelerate the use of chatbots among a
vulnerable population as schools, colleges, companies and others grapple with the
effects of popular generative A.I. technologies. Trained on huge amounts of data,
these systems can produce humanlike text and realistic-looking images and videos.
Google and other A.I. chatbot developers are locked in a fierce competition to
capture young users. President Trump recently urged schools to adopt the tools for
teaching and learning. Millions of teenagers are already using chatbots as study
aids, writing coaches and virtual companions. Children’s groups warn the chatbots
could pose serious risks to child safety. The bots also sometimes make stuff up.
UNICEF, the United Nation’s children’s agency, and other children’s groups have
noted that the A.I. systems could confuse, misinform and manipulate young
children who may have difficulty understanding that the chatbots are not human.
“Generative A.I. has produced dangerous content,” UNICEF’s global research
office said in a post on A.I. risks and opportunities for children.
Google acknowledged some risks in its email to families this week, alerting parents
that “Gemini can make mistakes” and suggesting they “help your child think
critically” about the chatbot.
The email also recommended parents teach their child how to fact-check Gemini’s
answers. And the company suggested parents remind their child that “Gemini isn’t
human” and “not to enter sensitive or personal info in Gemini.”
Despite the company’s efforts to filter inappropriate material, the email added,
children “may encounter content you don’t want them to see.”
A Google email to parents this week
warned about the risks of Gemini for
children.
Over the years, tech giants have developed a variety of products, features and
safeguards for teens and children. In 2015, Google introduced YouTube Kids, a
stand-alone video app for children that is popular among families with toddlers.
Other efforts to attract children online have prompted concerns from government
officials and children’s advocates. In 2021, Meta halted plans to introduce an
Instagram Kids service — a version of its Instagram app intended for those under
the age of 13 — after the attorneys general of several dozen states sent a letter to
the company saying the firm had “historically failed to protect the welfare of
children on its platforms.”
Some prominent tech companies — including Google, Amazon and Microsoft —
have also paid multimillion-dollar fines to settle government complaints that they
violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. That federal law requires
online services aimed at children to obtain a parent’s permission before collecting
personal information, like a home address or a selfie, from a child under 13.
Under the Gemini rollout, children with family-managed Google accounts would
initially be able to access the chatbot on their own. But the company said it would
alert parents and that parents could then manage their child’s chatbot settings,
“including turning access off.”
“Your child will be able to access Gemini Apps soon,” the company’s email to
parents said. “We’ll also let you know when your child accesses Gemini for the first
time.”
Mr. Ryan, the Google spokesman, said the approach to providing Gemini for young
users complied with the federal children’s online privacy law.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/technology/google-gemini-ai-chatbot-kids.html
Ana Swanson;Jonathan Swan,NYT,1,Business,4/25/2025,China Rejects Trump Claim of Tariff Talks With Xi,"President Trump, whose trade war with China has rattled financial markets and
threatened to disrupt huge swaths of trade, suggested on Friday that he had been
in touch with Xi Jinping, China’s president, even as Chinese officials insisted that
no negotiations were occurring.
In an interview with Time on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said Mr. Xi had called him,
though he declined to say when, and asserted that his team was in active talks with
China on a trade deal. Asked about the interview outside the White House on
Friday morning, the president reiterated that he had spoken with the Chinese
president “numerous times,” but he refused to answer when pressed on whether
any call had happened after he imposed tariffs this month.
Trump Claims He’s Negotiating With China on
Trade. China Says Otherwise.

Mr. Trump’s comments appeared aimed at creating the impression of progress with
China to soothe jittery financial markets, which have fallen amid signs that the
world’s largest economies are in a standoff. The S&P 500 is down 10 percent since
Mr. Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration.
But the president’s claims of talks have been rejected by Chinese officials, who
have repeatedly denied this week that they are actively negotiating with the United
States.
“China and the U.S. have not held consultations or negotiations on the issue of
tariffs,” Guo Jiakun, the spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, said in a news
conference on Friday. “The United States should not confuse the public.”
Chinese officials have repeatedly said the United States should stop threatening
China and engage in dialogue on the basis of equality and respect. On Thursday, He
Yadong, a spokesman for China’s Commerce Ministry, said there were “no
economic and trade negotiations between China and the United States.”
“Any claims about progress in China-U.S. economic and trade negotiations are
baseless rumors without factual evidence,” he said. The Chinese Embassy in
Washington declined to comment on Friday.

“As we have always stated, President Trump’s team continues to correspond with
their Chinese counterparts,” said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press
secretary. “The president remains optimistic about securing a fair trade deal with
China.”
Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese imports to a minimum of 145 percent this
month, in a bid to force China into trade negotiations. But Chinese officials
responded by issuing their own tariffs on American products and clamping down
on exports to the United States of minerals and magnets that are necessary for
many industries, including the defense sector.
The Chinese also appear to have ignored Mr. Trump’s suggestions that the best
way to resolve the issue would be for Mr. Xi to get in touch with him directly. With
the two governments at an impasse, businesses that rely on sourcing products
from China — varying from hardware stores to toymakers — have been thrown
into turmoil. The triple-digit tariff rates have forced many to halt shipments
entirely.
Trump officials have admitted that the status quo with China on trade is not
sustainable, and some have considered paring back levies on the country. But the
White House insists it will not do that unless a deal is reached for China to do the
same.
Asked in the Time interview if he would call Mr. Xi if the Chinese leader did not call
first, Mr. Trump said no.
“We’re meeting with China,” he said. “We’re doing fine with everybody.”
Mr. Trump also said, without evidence, that he had “made 200 deals.” He claimed
that he would finish and announce them in the next three to four weeks.
Mr. Trump announced higher “reciprocal” tariffs on nearly 60 countries at the
beginning of April. The White House has since said it received requests from
dozens of countries to negotiate trade terms, and Peter Navarro, the White House
trade adviser, has said the administration would strike “90 deals in 90 days.”
Ms. Leavitt said this week that the Trump administration had received 18 proposals
on paper and that the trade team was “meeting with 34 countries this week alone.”
But many trade experts have expressed skepticism, given that past U.S. trade
deals have taken on average over a year to negotiate.
The president told Time that trade with countries like China had been unfair and
needed to be changed. “You can’t let them make a trillion dollars from us,” he said.
Mr. Trump said he would look individually at companies seeking exemptions from
tariffs. He also said he had a list of products that would be fine to import. “There
are some products I really don’t want to make here,” he said.
But Mr. Trump insisted that tariffs were encouraging companies to move back to
the United States, and that he would consider having high tariffs a year from now a
“total victory” because the country would be “making a fortune.”
“This is a tremendous success,” he said. “You just don’t know it yet.”
In public, Mr. Trump has been saying that his tariffs are working out well, that
countries are coming to him begging for deals and that everything will work out
beautifully for the American people.
In private, the president’s team has been less cheery. Major retailers have briefed
Mr. Trump on their expectations for empty store shelves if his tariffs are kept in
place. His top economic advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce
Secretary Howard Lutnick, were so alarmed by the sell-off in the bond markets,
and the potential for a widespread financial panic, that they urged Mr. Trump to
put a 90-day pause on his reciprocal tariffs two weeks ago.
Since then, his team has focused on how to de-escalate his trade war with China
without appearing to have capitulated.
Mr. Trump and some of his advisers believed that the Chinese economy would be
highly vulnerable to U.S. tariffs, given the country’s dependence on exporting to
the United States. But they appear to have misunderstood the extent of the
president’s leverage over Mr. Xi.
Chinese officials have made clear, through their statements to the news media, that
they have not appreciated the bullying tone from Mr. Trump and that any
negotiations need to be run through a formal process.
Beijing has also carefully censored and curated information in China about the
trade war, and emphasized the country’s resilience and ability to withstand pain.
Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has seen his poll numbers drop. His approval rating on the
economy — always a strength for him — has now become a weakness. Republican
lawmakers fear a wipeout in the 2026 midterms, compounding the pressure on Mr.
Trump to make deals that will restore a sense of economic well-being.
Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and the former
head of the China division for the International Monetary Fund, said both countries
seemed to recognize the need to begin negotiations but each wanted to initiate
them on their own terms.
“The narrative in Beijing seems to have shifted in recent days, with policymakers
there stiffening their backs and feeling that they can ride this out,” he said. “Their
perception seems to be that the Trump team will come to them as the U.S. economy
is suffering proportionately more damage from the escalating trade war.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/trump-china-tariffs-xi-jinping.html
Tony Romm,NYT,1,Business,5/2/2025,Trump Proposes $163 Billion in Cuts Across Government in New Budget,"President Trump on Friday proposed slashing $163 billion in federal spending next
fiscal year, a drastic retrenchment in the role and reach of government that, if
enacted, would eliminate a vast set of climate, education, health and housing
programs, including some that benefit the poor.
Issuing his first budget proposal since returning to office, Mr. Trump sketched out a
dim view of Washington. His blueprint depicted many core government functions
as woke, weaponized, wasteful or radical, as the president looked to justify his
request that Congress chop domestic spending to its lowest level in the modern
era.
Record-Low Funding for Domestic Programs
President Trump’s budget proposes shrinking nondefense funding to its lowest level since
the 1960s, when these records began.

Mr. Trump proposed cutting funding for some federal law enforcement, including
the F.B.I. He called on lawmakers to slash money meant to police tax evasion at the
Internal Revenue Service. He recommended striking billions in funds that help
finance clean water projects. And the president reserved some of his deepest cuts
for education, health and science, including the National Institutes of Health and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which would see their budgets cut
by around half.
Democrats immediately rebuked Mr. Trump for his proposal. Senator Chuck
Schumer of New York, the Senate minority leader, called it “heartless” and an “all-
out assault on hardworking Americans.” Even some Republicans took issue with
Mr. Trump’s budget, although others, like Speaker Mike Johnson, endorsed the
blueprint.
Mr. Trump also asked Congress to reduce, if not eliminate, billions of dollars in
federal aid to help the poorest Americans. For one, the White House called for
reconfiguring federal programs that provide rental assistance to low-income
families, cutting aid by more than $26 billion next fiscal year. And the
administration proposed the termination of a federal initiative, backed by some
Republicans, that aids needy families in paying their monthly heating bills.
In one of the few spending increases included in the budget, Mr. Trump asked
lawmakers to bolster spending at the Department of Homeland Security by more
than $43 billion, furthering his work to crack down on immigration, conduct

deportations and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. The president also
requested more than $1 trillion for the military next fiscal year.
But he asked lawmakers to approve that increase essentially on a one-time basis,
as part of a broader legislative package — due later this year — meant to advance
the president’s tax agenda. The approach angered some Republicans, who signaled
they would pursue a larger increase to military spending as part of the yearly
process to fund government agencies and programs.
“It is peculiar how much time the president’s advisers spend talking about
restoring peace through strength, given how apparently unwilling they’ve been to
invest accordingly in the national defense or in other critical instruments of
national power,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republicans’
former Senate leader, in a statement that denounced the administration’s
“accounting gimmicks.”
For Mr. Trump, the budget served to formalize his conservative vision and his
disruptive reorganization of the government, a campaign that has already
shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of federal workers without the
explicit approval of Congress.
Some of Mr. Trump’s proposed military increases could benefit Elon Musk, the tech
billionaire who has advised Mr. Trump on cost-cutting as part of the Department of
Government Efficiency
Mr. Trump’s budget supported the creation of a new missile defense shield and a
renewed campaign for “U.S. space dominance.” Both are areas in which Mr. Musk
and his rocket company, SpaceX, could stand to win major contracts funded by any
increase in spending.
Proposed Budget Change by Agency

In a letter Friday accompanying the spending blueprint, Russell T. Vought, the
leader of the White House budget office, said the administration had produced its
submission after a “rigorous, line-by-line review of spending.”
Mr. Vought added that the president sought to root out money “contrary to the
needs of ordinary working Americans and tilted toward funding niche,
nongovernmental organizations and institutions of higher education committed to
radical gender and climate ideologies antithetical to the American way of life.”
Sharon Parrott, the president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, said many of the budget changes contemplated by Mr. Trump still
seemed most likely to fall hardest on low-income Americans, particularly those
who rely on government services.
“This is the latest repudiation of some of what he promised on the campaign trail,
in terms of being a president who was going to seek to serve people struggling at
the margins of the economy,” she said.

Mr. Trump’s proposal is not law. Totaling about $1.7 trillion, after accounting for the
full set of spending changes the president seeks, the budget serves only as a formal
guide to Congress, where it immediately generated opposition.
“President Trump has made his priorities clear as day: He wants to outright
defund programs that help working Americans while he shovels massive tax
breaks at billionaires like himself and raises taxes on middle-class Americans with
his reckless tariffs,” Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the leading Democrat on
the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.
The criticism was not limited to Democrats, as Republicans also raised alarm about
cuts to some programs that serve the neediest Americans. Outlining her “serious
objections,” Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who leads the
Appropriations Committee, added in a statement: “Ultimately, it is Congress that
holds the power of the purse.”
By releasing the budget, Mr. Trump set the stage for what is bound to be a
complicated, monthslong process to fund the government and avert a shutdown
before an existing spending deal expires on Sept. 30. Entering that fight, many
Republicans have echoed Mr. Trump’s desire to slash federal spending, though
warring G.O.P. factions have disagreed at times over the exact scope.
Party lawmakers have also raced to identify potentially trillions of dollars in cuts
that they can include to finance a related package that would expand a set of
expiring tax cuts for families and businesses, one of the president’s signature —
and costliest — economic policy priorities.
But Mr. Trump’s proposal carries additional significance. He and his top budget
adviser, Mr. Vought, subscribe to the idea that the commander in chief wields
expansive authority to halt or cancel spending, even if Congress instructs
otherwise. Their view has paved the way for the administration to slow, freeze or
cancel billions of dollars in funds, sparking a vast array of lawsuits and prompting
more than three dozen ongoing federal investigations into their activities.
On Friday, Mr. Trump’s proposal left unanswered some of the most important
questions facing Washington and its finances. It was silent on the nation’s fiscal
trajectory, even as the president seeks to cut taxes in a sprawling and costly
legislative package that carries substantial implications for the nation’s $36 trillion
debt.
“It remains to be seen what the rest of the president’s proposals will hold, and
there is still the multitrillion-dollar question of whether the reconciliation bill will
blow up the debt,” said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a
Responsible Federal Budget, a group that advocates deficit reduction.
Nor did the president’s new budget address the future of the federal benefit
programs, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, that comprise the
largest share of federal spending annually. Some Republicans are particularly
interested in rethinking Medicaid, which provides health insurance to poor
families, as a source of savings to pay for their tax cuts.
The administration is expected to send those details in a fuller budget to Congress
as soon as this month.

Christine Chung,NYT,1,Business,5/2/2025,Newark Airport Is Experiencing Major Flight Delays. What’s Causing Them?,"Flying into or out of Newark Liberty International Airport has brought plenty of
misery in the last week, with cancellations, delays stretching well past five hours
and flight diversions that have stranded travelers far from their destinations.
Passengers are reporting on social media that they have missed flights and spent
hours stuck on the tarmac aboard planes. Some are still struggling to make new
travel arrangements.
The disruptions, which stretched into Friday with delays averaging over two hours,
have highlighted ongoing air traffic control staffing issues. The troubles prompted
United Airlines, Newark’s largest carrier, to cut nearly three dozen round-trip
flights per day at the hub beginning this weekend, the carrier’s chief executive,
Scott Kirby, announced on Friday.

Newark Airport?

Here’s what anyone heading to Newark Airport needs to know.
Air traffic control staffing is limiting capacity
Last summer, management of the airspace surrounding Newark shifted from New
York to Philadelphia. This move, which involved relocating at least a dozen air
traffic controllers, was meant to ease air traffic delays.
The Federal Aviation Administration has attributed this week’s flight disruptions at
Newark to equipment failures and unspecified staffing issues at the Philadelphia
air traffic control center as well as to construction on one of Newark’s runways.
These ongoing staffing issues are “effectively limiting the capacity of Newark
Airport,” said Aidan O’Donnell, the general manager of New Jersey airports at the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The other major New York City airports, Kennedy and LaGuardia, are managed by
the New York control center.
One of Newark’s runways is closed
A planned runway rehabilitation project has left Newark Airport with just two
operating runways, a situation that staffing shortages at the Philadelphia air traffic

One of the airport’s three runways was shut down on April 15 for rehabilitation and
repaving, with plans to reopen in mid-June.
This is a “very routine construction project,” said Mr. O’Donnell, and the airport
had prepared for it extensively by taking steps such as scheduling fewer flights
during this period.
Times travel coverage. When our writers review a destination, they do not accept
free or discounted services or, in most cases, reveal that they work for The Times.
We want their experience to be what you can expect.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Though the airport has two remaining open runways, the F.A.A. has underutilized
one of them during the closure, Mr. O’Donnell said. “When we only have one
runway that’s available, we are simultaneously landing and departing on the same
runway, which is the least efficient way that traffic can be managed into and out of
Newark,” he added.
The airport has more than 1,000 scheduled arrivals and departures each day, the
majority of which are operated by United.
The wave of disruptions that started on Monday has only
intensified
The Philadelphia control center experienced telecommunications and equipment
issues on Monday, an F.A.A. spokesperson said. That led to hundreds of delays and
cancellations and three dozen flight diversions that day, Mr. O’Donnell said. He
added that for two hours on Monday afternoon, no flights departed from or landed
at Newark.
The disruptions continued through the week as air traffic controller shortages
worsened in Philadelphia. Scott Kirby, the chief executive of United Airlines, said in
a letter to customers that more than 20 percent of the air traffic controllers
responsible for Newark “walked off the job” this week.
Mr. Kirby added that staffing shortages at the Philadelphia control center have
been a problem for years.
A spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association declined to
comment.
The problems may persist for weeks or months
The next few weeks could be challenging, Mr. O’Donnell warned.
Mass flight delays and cancellations can take days to resolve, as airlines navigate
getting passengers, crew and aircraft back on track. Both United and JetBlue
Airways have issued flight waivers allowing travelers to rebook without incurring
extra fees.
United will cut 35 out of an average of 328 round-trip flights per day from its
Newark schedule starting this weekend. The airport, one of the airline’s seven
hubs, is a key gateway for flying to Europe, India and the Middle East.
Without enough controllers, “Newark airport cannot handle the number of planes
that are scheduled to operate there in the weeks and months ahead,” Mr. Kirby
said, adding that the flight reduction was a stopgap measure “since there is no way
to resolve the near-term structural F.A.A. staffing issues.”

Stacy Cowley,NYT,1,Business,4/27/2025,New Details Emerge on Trump Officials’ Sprint to Gut Consumer Bureau Staff,"Two weeks ago, a three-judge panel from the federal appeals court in Washington
lifted a freeze on firing employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,
with some conditions. The judges, ruling on a Friday night, said that workers could
be fired if agency leaders determined, after a careful assessment, that they were
not needed to carry out the bureau’s legally required responsibilities.
Within hours, Trump administration officials — working closely with Elon Musk’s
associates at the Department of Government Efficiency — scurried to fire nearly
all the agency’s employees. By the following Thursday afternoon, bureau leaders
sent termination notices to nearly 1,500 employees, retaining barely 200 people,
and ordered that the fired workers’ access to agency systems be shut down the
next day.
A judge has again stopped the cuts for now. But the details of what happened at the
agency, which oversees banks and lenders and enforces consumer protection laws,
will be vital to determining if the firings can proceed. Hundreds of pages of newly
released agency records, supplemented by narrative accounts filed in court by
more than 20 agency employees, were submitted ahead of a hearing this week
before Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the Federal District Court in Washington.
Judge Jackson halted the planned firings less than a day after the notices went out,
saying that they went far beyond what the appeals court had allowed. Starting
Tuesday, she will hold a two-day hearing to take witness testimony and decide
whether to extend her order blocking the firings.
The consumer bureau has been on life support since February, when Trump
officials arrived at the agency and began dismantling it. A series of federal court
rulings prohibited the agency’s destruction. Congress created the agency in 2011 to
add safeguards around mortgages and other consumer financial products, and only
Congress has the power to abolish it.
Mark Paoletta, the agency’s chief legal officer and the mastermind behind the
termination plan, defended the firings, saying in a legal filing that they would
“right-size” an agency filled with “vast waste.” Russell Vought, the White House
budget office director who also serves as the bureau’s acting director, has called the
bureau a “woke and weaponized” agency.
But firing so many workers at once, with no transition period, would destroy the
bureau’s ability to operate, employees warned their bosses in emails, chat
messages and verbal conversations, according to court records. Within days,
critical technical systems would fail, enforcement lawyers would miss court
deadlines and agency data that federal courts had ordered be preserved would be
lost, they said.
“I don’t think we can keep operating even for 60 days without keeping many of
these folks,” Christopher Chilbert, the bureau’s chief information officer, wrote in an
email the day the terminations were announced.
Adam Martinez, the agency’s chief operating officer, responded: “Understood and I
do not disagree. We will really need to spend the next week figuring out a path
forward.”
Judge Jackson has asked for the testimony of Gavin Kliger, a 25-year-old associate
of Mr. Musk’s who carried out the terminations.
Are you a federal worker? We want to hear from you.
The Times would like to hear about your experience as a federal worker under the second
Trump administration. We may reach out about your submission, but we will not publish
any part of your response without contacting you first.
Mr. Kliger, a former Twitter summer intern who had no experience in government
work before this year, joined the Office of Personnel Management in January as a
senior adviser. He has carried out assignments for Mr. Musk’s Department of
Government Efficiency, or DOGE, in at least nine agencies, including the Internal
Revenue Service, where he is said to have been recently ousted from.
Emails sent in the hours after the appeals court ruled that staff cuts could move
forward show Mr. Musk’s officials scrambling to fire people as quickly as possible
— at times moving so fast they appeared to forget which agency they were focused
on.
Jeremy Lewin, a 28-year-old lawyer who leads DOGE’s State Department foreign
aid actions, sent an email on Saturday from his U.S. Agency for International
Development email address laying the groundwork for the reduction in force, the
government’s version of a layoff. In a nod to specific language in the appellate
court’s order, Mr. Lewin wrote, “Director Vought’s team and I will conduct an
individualized assessment to, consistent with the DC Circuit’s stay, ensure that only
nonstatutory positions are affected.”
Mr. Paoletta said in court filings that he worked with two other lawyers to conduct
a unit-by-unit evaluation of the consumer bureau and determined that the bureau
could function without 90 percent of its current staff.
“An approximately 200-person agency allows the bureau to fulfill its statutory
duties and better aligns with the new leadership’s priorities and management
philosophy,” he said.
But emails and other agency records show that up until nearly the moment the
termination notices were sent, bureau officials were still debating the numbers. On
the Tuesday before the notices went out, some workers trying to prepare materials
believed 485 workers would remain.
Trump officials wanted those slated for termination to be cut off from the agency’s
systems less than 24 hours after receiving their layoff notice. One human resources
worker involved in the planning asked a manager how people who were traveling
and unable to check their email before losing access would be notified of their
firing.
“Many people have asked that question. No one making decisions really cares,” the
manager responded. “It makes me sad.”
In legal declarations totaling more than 100 pages, department heads — who said
they were not consulted by the Trump officials before the firings — and other
workers depicted the terminations as reckless and riddled with errors.
The one person Mr. Paoletta left in the Office of Servicemember Affairs, a legally
required unit that aids military workers, had already accepted the government’s
deferred resignation offer and would be retiring in September. He had turned in his
work equipment and lost access to agency systems, workers said — meaning the
office would be unstaffed if the firings proceeded.
The head of another legally required department said that he and all of his workers
had received termination notices, despite Mr. Paoletta’s testimony that one worker
had been retained.
“If there is such a person, that person has not reached out to me or, to my
knowledge, to anyone else in my office to understand how we fulfill our statutory
mandate,” the department head said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/business/cfpb-layoffs-trump-musk-doge.html
Benjamin Mullin,NYT,1,Business,5/2/2025,Trump’s Order to Cut Funding for NPR and PBS Draws Fiery Pushback,"President Trump’s executive order to defund NPR and PBS was met with fiery
pushback on Friday, as the organizations challenged the legality of the move and
said it could jeopardize access to vital information.
The order issued late Thursday instructed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
which receives and distributes over $500 million in taxpayer money to public TV
and radio stations annually, to eliminate millions of dollars in federal funding to the
two public media organizations. It amounts to perhaps the most significant threat
in a decades-long campaign by Republicans to weaken NPR and PBS.
Patricia Harrison, the chief executive of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a
private company, said in a statement that the White House had no legal authority
over the company. NPR vowed to challenge the order, calling it “an affront to the
First Amendment.”
Paula Kerger, the chief executive of PBS, also called Mr. Trump’s executive order
illegal. “The president’s blatantly unlawful executive order, issued in the middle of
the night, threatens our ability to serve the American public with educational
programming, as we have for the past 50-plus years,” Ms. Kerger said.
NPR and PBS Vow to Fight Trump’s Order to
Cut Funding
Mr. Trump and other Republicans have long argued that NPR and PBS have a
liberal bias and that taxpayers should not fund their journalism as a result. The
executive order echoed those arguments, saying NPR and PBS do not present “a
fair, accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events.”
Mr. Trump’s executive order was the fourth effort by Republicans to weaken public
media in as many months: A bill is working its way through Congress to defund
NPR and PBS; the White House asked Congress on Friday to reduce federal
funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting; and this week, Mr. Trump
sought to fire three directors from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a move
that was delayed by the courts.
The president’s order on Thursday also instructed federal agencies to cut any
funding to NPR and PBS. Some federal agencies, such as the Department of
Education, have historically awarded grants to public media outlets.
The change, if it survives a legal challenge, would have significant effects on NPR
and PBS, though those organizations could survive without government funding.
Roughly 2 percent of NPR’s budget comes from federal grants; for PBS, that
number is around 16 percent. Both organizations receive government support
indirectly through dues and program licensing fees from their member stations.
But the executive order could fundamentally alter NPR’s and PBS’s relationships
with their member stations. For decades, local TV and radio stations across the
United States have used federal money to buy popular programming, like “All
Things Considered” from NPR and “PBS NewsHour.”
Mr. Trump’s order could forbid local stations to spend their money on those
programs, barring indirect federal support of those organizations, even if it does
not explicitly eliminate funding for local TV and radio stations scattered across the
United States, many of which rely on government support to survive.
It would probably not have immediate effect, since the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting has already distributed much of its money for 2025.
Amanda Mountain, the chief executive of Rocky Mountain Public Media in
Colorado, urged her members to stay informed, donate and speak up for public
broadcasting.
“Make your voice heard,” she wrote in an email obtained by The New York Times.
“If you value free, public‐service media, contact your representatives.”
Susan Goldberg, the president and chief executive of GBH, a public broadcaster in
Boston, said the loss of federal funding “would be a crippling blow for the millions
of people who rely on our services for news and education, especially children.”
Richard H. Pildes, a professor of constitutional law at the New York University
School of Law, said the executive order could run afoul of a federal law that
prohibited the president from rescinding federal funding without permission from
Congress.
“As a general matter, Congress controls the purse strings,” Professor Pildes said.
“The president doesn’t have the power to refuse to spend money that Congress has
appropriated for specific purposes.”
He also said it was unclear whether Mr. Trump had the authority to order the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting to do anything, since it is a private,
nongovernmental entity.
A spokeswoman for the White House did not respond to a request for comment.
The specter of defunding has loomed over public media organizations for so long
that executives have developed contingency plans. In 2011, NPR put together a
secret plan to assess what would happen if all federal funding was eliminated from
public media. According to the analysis, NPR could lose between $1 million and $27
million, with as many as 181 local stations shutting down. A contingency plan from
this spring called the prospect of total defunding “akin to an asteroid striking
without warning.”
Mr. Trump’s order came down just as public radio executives from across the
United States met in Washington for NPR’s spring board meeting. Katherine
Maher, the chief executive of NPR, addressed the order during the board meeting,
saying existing laws prevent any employee of the U.S. government from exercising
control over public broadcasting.
“We will strongly defend our work and the editorial independence of our journalists
and continue to tell the stories of the country with accuracy, objectivity, and
fairness,” Ms. Maher said.
A correction was made on May 2, 2025: An earlier version of this article incorrectly
stated that President Trump’s executive order targeting funding for NPR and PBS
accused them of producing “left-wing propaganda.” The order said the organizations
were biased, but did not use the phrase “left-wing propaganda.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/business/media/npr-pbs-federal-funding.html
Patricia Cohen,NYT,1,Business,4/28/2025,Why the Economic Disruption From Trump’s Tariff War Will Be Hard to Reverse,"President Trump has made clear his intent to smash the reigning global economic
order. And in 100 days, he has made remarkable progress in accomplishing that
goal.
Mr. Trump has provoked a trade war, scrapped treaties and suggested that
Washington might not defend Europe. He is also dismantling the governmental
infrastructure that has provided the know-how and experience.
The changes have been deep. But the world is still churning. Midterm elections in
two years could erode the Republican majority in Congress. And Mr. Trump’s reign
is constitutionally mandated to end in four years. Could the next president come in
and undo what the Trump administration has done?

As Cardinal Michael Czerny, a close aide to Pope Francis, said of the Catholic
Church: “There is nothing that we have done over 2,000 years that couldn’t be
rolled back.”
The same could be said of global geopolitics. Yet even at this early stage, historians
and political scientists agree that on some crucial counts, the changes wrought by
Mr. Trump may be hard to reverse.
Like the erosion of trust in the United States, a resource that took generations to
build.
“The MAGA base and JD Vance will still be around long after Trump’s gone,” said
Ian Goldin, professor of globalization and development at the University of Oxford.
No matter who occupies the White House next, the conditions that propelled the
“Make America Great Again” movement — widening inequality and economic
insecurity — remain. For the rest of the world, there is still a worry, he said, that
there could be “another Trump in the future.”
As a result, allies are working to strike trade partnerships and build security
alliances that exclude the United States. The European Union and South American
countries recently created one of the world’s largest trade zones.
The Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, recently proposed building new
transportation networks to ease access to global markets outside the United States.
Canada is also negotiating to join Europe’s military buildup to reduce its reliance
on the United States, while Britain and the European Union are working to finalize
a defense pact.

“The world moves on,” Mr. Goldin said. Supply chains will be rearranged, new
partnerships will be struck, and foreign students, researchers and tech talent will
find other places to migrate. “The U.S. is not going to quickly restore its economic
position,” he said.
“And it’s not just the United States that is so different now,” he added. Mr. Trump is
emboldening autocratic leaders around the world, which further chips away at the
rules-based system.

China’s top leader, Mr. Xi, is seeking to exploit Mr. Trump’s protectionist turn and
chaotic policy reversals to better position Beijing as the defender of free trade and
the new leader of the global trading system.
Mr. Xi’s argument particularly resonates among many emerging economies in
Latin America, Asia and Africa. China looks “steady and stable and a picture of
equanimity compared to the United States,” said Jonathan Czin, a fellow at the
Brookings Institution’s China Center and a former senior China analyst for the
Central Intelligence Agency.
Africa is a prime example. Mr. Trump has gutted the U.S. Agency for International
Development, which delivered food and health care to the world’s poorest. And the
reorganization plan for the State Department has proposed eliminating nearly all
diplomatic missions across the continent.
By comparison, China has already invested deeply in Africa as part of its Belt and
Road Initiative, and its push to control more of the continent’s critical minerals. “It
creates a vacuum that allows China to consolidate that position and control over
those mining rights,” Mr. Czin said.

Mr. Trump’s hostility to allies could also undercut government efforts in recent
years to keep advanced technology out of China’s hands. Those previously close
relations were crucial in persuading the Netherlands and Japan to halt exports of
advanced semiconductor equipment to China.
Antony Hopkins, a history professor at Cambridge University, added that Mr.
Trump was forgetting the important role China played as an international investor
and buyer of U.S. debt. If China’s access to America’s large consumer market is
severely curtailed, “you are courting the possibility of damaging China’s ability to
invest in U.S. Treasury bonds, and if you do that, you’re shooting yourself in the
foot.”
Another region caught between the United States and China is Southeast Asia. But
as Mr. Trump threatened, and then paused until early July, potentially ruinous
tariffs on the export-oriented economies of countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh and
Indonesia, China gained an opportunity to strengthen ties.

Finally, the evisceration of the federal government’s research and data collection
capabilities risks undermining America’s scientific excellence and competitive
edge. According to the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, the
federal government finances roughly 40 percent of the long-term basic research
that undergirds the country’s technological and scientific breakthroughs.
The administration is cutting billions of dollars in grants to universities, scientists
and researchers, undermining work on topics like environmental hazards, disease
control, climate and clean energy programs, computer processing, agriculture,
defense and artificial intelligence. It has slashed funding for the cybersecurity
work that protects the power grid, pipelines and telecommunications. Thousands of
veteran and up-and-coming experts have been fired.
Institutions are worried about a brain drain as American and foreign researchers
turn elsewhere for grants, jobs and academic freedom.
Nor would it be easy to quickly reconstitute the networks of people, assistance,
information and logistical know-how contained in agencies that have been
disbanded or emptied.
“This is a revolution dedicated to destroying not only policies but institutions,” Mr.
Schell at the Asia Society said. Even if the Democrats regain power, it’s not clear
“there will be a structure to revive or whether it will have to be arduously rebuilt.”
Sometimes a signature event like the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 serves as an
endpoint to an era. But it is not necessarily always clear in real time if stress on a
system is so extreme that it won’t be able to snap back.
Many people thought the “Nixon shock” represented such a break, David Ekbladh,
a history professor at Tufts University, said. In 1971 President Richard M. Nixon
terminated the system of fixed exchange rates and severed the value of the U.S.
dollar from gold.
The author William Greider called it the “precise date on which America’s singular
dominance” of the global economy ended. Chaos enveloped global markets, and
America’s allies worried that the president’s unilateral decision undermined the
postwar cooperative system. Still, the larger economic order held.
“The game changed, but it wasn’t a revolution,” Mr. Ekbladh said. Negotiations to
open markets continued, America’s alliances remained intact and the Group of 10
negotiated a new arrangement. Respect internationally for the rule of law
prevailed, and the United States was still universally seen as the leader of the free
world.
The question for the United States now is how deep support is for the system that
was, Mr. Ekbladh said. These currents of deep discontent with the global economy
have been bubbling up for a long time, and many people voted for Mr. Trump
because of his promise to upend the system. “Do the American people want this to
go away?”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/business/economy/trump-trade-global-economy.html
Stanley Reed,NYT,1,Business,5/3/2025,Why OPEC Plus Is Increasing Oil Supplies Despite Falling Prices,"Oil prices are falling. Economists are cutting forecasts for global economic growth.
Oil giants are reporting lower profits.
But on Saturday, eight countries that belong to the oil cartel known as OPEC Plus
said they would add about 411,000 barrels of oil a day in June. The move, which
follows a similar step by the group to increase oil production at their April meeting,
is a major shift in policy that will ripple through the wider energy industry, hitting
profits of oil companies and forcing cutbacks.
The group said in a statement that the market was “healthy” and noted that oil
inventories remained low.
Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC Plus, is signaling that it is reluctant to
hold back millions of barrels a day of oil that it could produce, especially when
other members of the group, like Kazakhstan and Iraq, are not observing their
agreed-upon production ceilings.
“The view from Saudi Arabia, in particular, is that they no longer want to be the
ones carrying the heaviest burden if other countries in the group are not showing
sufficient commitment to doing their part,” said Richard Bronze, the head of
geopolitics at Energy Aspects, a London research firm.
Demand for oil has not weakened significantly. Oil consumption increased by 1.2
million barrels a day in the first quarter of 2025, the most since 2023, according to
the International Energy Agency in Paris. Analysts there and elsewhere, though,
are cutting their forecasts for demand in anticipation of disruption from global
trade tensions, which has already slammed prices.
Prices of Brent crude, the international benchmark, have fallen close to 20 percent
since April 3, when the Saudis and other producers signaled they would increase
production.
The price of West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark, slipped this week
below $60 a barrel, a threshold where many producers can no longer make a profit,
and analysts say that prices could fall further. Under such pressures, producers
with higher costs, like shale drillers in the United States, which have been
increasing output in recent years while OPEC restrained production, may be forced
to cut back.
“To the extent that OPEC Plus cannot or will not reduce output at any time to
support prices, the burden of shoring them up would fall on other higher-cost
producers,” wrote analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, considered the main decision makers
among oil producers these days, may also be more inclined to bolster the ambitions
of President Trump, who is expected to visit Saudi Arabia and other Middle East
countries soon, than they were in aiding his predecessor, Joseph R. Biden Jr.
This price drop “represents one of the most important economic bright spots” for
the Trump administration, Helima Croft, head of global commodities at RBC
Capital Markets, an investment bank, wrote in a recent note to clients. Mr. Trump
has promised to lower energy costs, including gas prices, for consumers.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates may be hoping for some concessions in
deals in defense or artificial intelligence, where both countries have strong
ambitions, analysts say. Already, the Trump administration is reviving talks on a
nuclear partnership with Saudi Arabia.
Typically, OPEC Plus would be scrambling to cut supplies to bolster markets. Such
calculations have clearly changed among a smaller group of eight OPEC Plus
members, including Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates. They have
instead been unwinding an earlier agreement to restrain their production by about
2.2 million barrels a day.
Of late, this smaller group has been meeting to make deals, leaving the rest of
OPEC Plus in the rear seat. Saudi Arabia, which seems to be running the process, is
gaining the largest of the increases.
“It really comes down to whether Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are
willing to cut production further to support prices,” said Bhushan Bahree, an
executive director at S&P Global.
So far, the answer is no.
The United Arab Emirates is one of several producers, along with Kazakhstan and
Iraq, that has an interest in raising production to accommodate the added output
from oil and gas investments by international companies.
Kazakhstan produced about 400,000 barrels a day above its OPEC Plus ceiling in
March, according to the International Energy Agency. In the same period, Iraq
exceeded its ceiling by 440,000 barrels a day and the United Arab Emirates by
350,000.
Kazakhstan seems reluctant to rein in investors like Chevron and Exxon Mobil,
which recently spent tens of billions of dollars to raise production to one million
barrels a day at the Tengiz oil field in the country.
“We don’t engage in discussions about OPEC or OPEC Plus targets,” Mike Wirth,
Chevron’s chairman and chief executive, told analysts on Friday during an
earnings call. Mr. Wirth added that Tengiz was an important source of revenue for
the Kazakhstan government and had not been “curtailed” historically.
“We follow national interests, strictly observing our international obligations,” the
Kazakhstan Energy Ministry said in an emailed statement.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/business/opec-plus-oil-production-

The stock market recorded a weekly gain, as investors latch on to any signs of
easing trade tensions.
The S&P 500, which was roughly flat in early trading on Friday before rising 0.7
percent for the day, ended the week 4.6 percent higher. Still, the index remains
sharply lower since President Trump returned to office.
The stock market has seen dramatic swings in recent days, with Wall Street
grasping for scraps of information about tariffs, trade and other crucial issues that
can shift from day to day. Monday saw a sharp sell-off fueled by Mr. Trump’s
renewed attacks on Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, followed by
four days of sizable gains.
On Friday, jittery traders were confronted with the latest in a stream of
contradicting claims about trade negotiations and tariffs. The head of an American
business group in China said that the Chinese government was considering
exempting some products from its 125 percent retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.
Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said that
the commerce ministry had canvassed businesses in China to identify U.S. imports
that were crucial to supply chains and vulnerable to China’s new trade barriers.
For some companies, he said, “their business model would not work in China, and
we would see them exit” if the trade war persisted long-term.
Also on Friday, the Chinese government reiterated that it was not engaged in trade
negotiations with officials in Washington, pushing back against Mr. Trump’s claim
that the U.S.-China talks were underway. “The United States should not confuse the
public,” a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Mr. Trump
suggested in an interview with Time that he had been in touch with Xi Jinping,
China’s president, and asserted that his team was in active talks with China on a
trade deal.
your inbox.
The counterclaims followed reports in Chinese media outlets and on Chinese social
media this week that Beijing would forgo retaliatory tariffs on some U.S.-made
semiconductor-related products. The Chinese government has not announced any
such policy.
The New York Times heard from hundreds of American business owners who said
they had been stunned into paralysis by Mr. Trump’s barrage of tariffs. They are
reassessing their product lines and supply chains and even putting their operations
on hold. Businesses are rushing to cancel factory orders or halt shipping containers
before they leave China, pausing capital investments and new hiring, and scaling
back spending to the bare necessities.
In the United States, executives at consumer-oriented companies have said that
worries and uncertainty about the global economy are dampening spending. On
Thursday, PepsiCo cut its full-year guidance outlook, citing a reduction in
consumer spending as well as the impact of higher global tariffs. Procter &
Gamble, which makes household staples like Tide detergent, also cut its full-year
outlook and said whiplash on tariff policy had factored into a “pause” in
consumption.
“The consumer has been hit with a lot, and that’s a lot to process,” Andre Schulten,
P&G’s chief financial officer, told analysts, citing tariff uncertainty and
“divisiveness and nationalistic rhetoric.”
Indeed, on Friday came signs that Americans were feeling gloomier about the
economy. An updated University of Michigan measurement showed consumer
sentiment falling for the fourth consecutive month, with the looming effects of
tariffs weighing on American households. Expectations for future business and
finance conditions have fallen 32 percent since January, the survey found.
Some analysts cautioned that the stock market’s gains this week did not indicate
that the fundamental economic concerns that had fueled its volatility had been
resolved.
“The road back to record highs won’t be easy,” said Mark Hackett, the chief market
strategist at Nationwide. “Markets are showing resilience, but still face the same
persistent challenges, including tariff uncertainty and signs of an economic
slowdown.”
Elsewhere in the markets:
Markets in Asia were broadly higher, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 gaining 1.8 percent
and Taiwan’s benchmark index up 2 percent. In Europe, stocks gained ground.
Shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, rose 1.5 percent on Friday. On
Thursday, the technology giant reported a large jump in quarterly profit. The
tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3 percent on Friday.
The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds fell about five basis points, to 4.26 percent.
Oil futures wobbled, with Brent crude falling about 1 percent before inching
higher, to roughly $67 a barrel.

Amanda Holpuch,NYT,1,Business,4/27/2025,"Titanic Survivor’s Letter, Written Aboard the Ship, Sells for Nearly $400,000","Days before the Titanic struck an iceberg, a first-class passenger, Col. Archibald
Gracie, described the vessel in a letter written while on board: “It is a fine ship but
I shall await my journey’s end before I pass judgment on her.”
Colonel Gracie’s journey on the Titanic had a catastrophic end, but he fared better
than most.
He was on the top deck of the ship, gripping a railing, as it plunged into the sea. He
said he was “swirled” under water before he got to a raft, where he spent hours
floating on icy waters before being rescued.
The letter he wrote was sold on Saturday at an auction for $399,000 (or 300,000
pounds), according to Henry Aldridge and Son, an auction house in Wiltshire,
England.
The auction house said the letter, written in neat, cursive handwriting, was
addressed to an unidentified European ambassador, the great-uncle of the seller.
The letterhead shows a triangular red flag with a white star and is printed with the
words “On board R.M.S. Titanic.”
The letter was dated April 10, 1912, the day the ship set sail from Southampton,
England. On April 12, it was postmarked in London, where it was received at the
Waldorf Hotel. The Titanic struck an iceberg just before midnight on April 14 and
sank the next day.
The buyer of the letter was based in the United States, according to Andrew
Aldridge, the managing director of Henry Aldridge and Son. The auction house did
not publicly identify the buyer or the seller.
Mr. Aldridge said in an email that the stories of the ship’s passengers “are told
through the memorabilia” and that “their memories are kept alive through those
items.”
The auction house had initially expected the letter to sell for up to 60,000 pounds,
or nearly $80,000.
Colonel Gracie, a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point,
was a high-profile survivor of the Titanic disaster, in which about 1,500 people
perished.
He died eight months later, in December 1912, of complications from diseases, but
his doctors and his family said that the real cause was that he had never recovered
from the shock of the Titanic disaster, according to The New York Times.
After Colonel Gracie was rescued, he began work on “The Truth About the Titanic,”
a book about his experience that was published posthumously. The New York
Times review of the book said “there is something effective in the very lack of
directness and coherency in the narrative.”
Colonel Gracie said in an interview with The New York Tribune that he had been on
the top deck of the ship when it was hit by a wave that sent other people overboard.
He managed to stay on and grabbed a brass railing.
“When the ship plunged down, I was forced to let go, and I was swirled around and
around for what seemed an interminable time,” he said. “Eventually I came to the
surface to find the sea a mass of tangled wreckage.”
He said he grabbed a wooden grating and then saw a canvas-and-cork raft. He
made it onto the raft and began trying to rescue others. They eventually reached a
rescue ship, R.M.S. Carpathia.
“The hours that elapsed before we were picked up by the Carpathia were the
longest and most terrible that I ever spent,” Colonel Gracie said, according to The
Tribune. “Practically without any sensation of feeling because of the icy water, we
were almost dropping from fatigue.”
The letter sold at auction on Saturday for nearly $400,000
or 300,000 pounds. Henry Aldridge & Son
Colonel Gracie was an established figure in New York and Washington society.
His father had been an officer in the Confederate Army during the Civil War.
Colonel Gracie was also a descendant of Archibald Gracie, who built the New York
City mayor’s official residence, Gracie Mansion, in 1799.
After news of the Titanic’s sinking reached the United States, and it was not known
whether Colonel Gracie had survived, his wife, Constance Schack Gracie, was
reported missing for unrelated reasons.
Mrs. Gracie had not been on the ship, but had left town to avoid being subpoenaed
in the lunacy trial of another society woman, Mary E. Gage, according to The New
York Times.
In the days after the Titanic disaster, the Gracies’ daughter, Edith Gracie, was
asked about the whereabouts of her mother, which she said she did not know, and
about the fate of her father, The Times reported.
She said Colonel Gracie had been in Europe recuperating from an operation and
had said in a letter that he would return home with a much stronger constitution.
“It is too terrible to think of,” she said, “but I am hoping against hope that he has
come through the perils of the accident without harm.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/world/europe/titanic-survivor-letter-

Katie Thomas;Jessica Silver-Greenberg,NYT,1,Business,4/24/2025,Leaders of Mental Health Giant Promised Big Bonuses to Deal With Federal Investigations,"Last year was tough for Acadia Healthcare, one of the country’s largest providers
of mental health services.
A slew of federal agencies opened investigations into whether Acadia illegally held
patients against their will in its psychiatric hospitals, as described in a New York
Times investigation in September. The federal inquiries rattled investors, causing
Acadia’s stock to plummet.
But Acadia’s troubles have been a boon to the company’s chief executive,
Christopher Hunter. Its board of directors awarded him a $1.8 million bonus to help
respond to “unprecedented governmental inquiries,” according to a financial filing
this month. The bonus comes on top of his regular compensation, which totaled
more than $7 million in 2024.
Acadia’s chief financial officer and general counsel were also granted bonuses of
about $1 million, and the chief operating officer was promised $600,000. Acadia said
the bonuses, which will be paid in March of next year, were awarded to ensure that
the leaders did not leave before the investigations were completed.
The company’s board decided that keeping its leadership team was “in the best
long-term interest of the company and the patients and communities it serves,”
said Tim Blair, a spokesman for Acadia. “The company follows a pay-for-
performance philosophy, using peer market data for benchmarking and
calibration,” he added.
The Times reported that Acadia was holding patients against their will in order to
maximize insurance payouts. Some patients arrived at emergency rooms seeking
routine mental health care but were sent to Acadia facilities, where they were
locked inside and isolated from their families. The practices began before Mr.
Hunter became chief executive, in April 2022, but continued under his watch, The
Times found.

groundbreaking of a facility in Greenville, N.C., in 2023. WCTI News 12, via YouTube
The company has forcefully denied any misconduct and said it would cooperate
with the investigations. “The allegation that Acadia systematically holds patients
longer than medically necessary is false and goes directly against everything we
do and stand for when it comes to patient care,” Mr. Hunter told investors in
October.
After the article was published, Acadia told investors that several government
agencies, including the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, had begun investigations. In October, executives disclosed that
admissions to their facilities were not as high as expected. That same month,
shareholders brought a class-action lawsuit against the company, arguing that
Acadia concealed its practices from investors.
The Times also found problems in other parts of Acadia’s businesses, including its
methadone clinics, which were billing the government for services, like counseling,
that it did not provide. And inadequate staffing led to a series of tragedies at one of
the company’s prized women’s facilities, The Times reported Tuesday.
Since September, the company has lost roughly $5 billion of its market value and is
now worth about $2 billion.
Like many chief executives, Mr. Hunter’s compensation is tied in part to Acadia’s
share value. In 2024, the company’s falling stock led him to miss his performance
goals, which lowered his pay, according to the April filing.
But Sarah Anderson, an executive compensation analyst at the Institute for Policy
Studies, a left-leaning think tank, said that those incentives are undermined when
companies like Acadia give bonuses despite poor performance.
“The whole argument of tying your compensation to the stock price is so that the
executives will bear risk of their actions,” she said. “This is just going completely
against that.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/health/acadia-bonuses.html
Elizabeth Williamson,NYT,1,Business,4/24/2025,Elon Musk and DOGE’s Savings May Be Erased by New Costs,"President Trump and Elon Musk promised taxpayers big savings, maybe even a
“DOGE dividend” check in their mailboxes, when the Department of Government
Efficiency was let loose on the federal government. Now, as he prepares to step
back from his presidential assignment to cut bureaucratic fat, Mr. Musk has said
without providing details that DOGE is likely to save taxpayers only $150 billion.
That is about 15 percent of the $1 trillion he pledged to save, less than 8 percent of
the $2 trillion in savings he had originally promised and a fraction of the nearly $7
trillion the federal government spent in the 2024 fiscal year.
The errors and obfuscations underlying DOGE’s claims of savings are well
documented. Less known are the costs Mr. Musk incurred by taking what Mr.
Trump called a “hatchet” to government and the resulting firings, agency lockouts
and building seizures that mostly wound up in court.
The Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization that studies the
federal work force, has used budget figures to produce a rough estimate that
firings, re-hirings, lost productivity and paid leave of thousands of workers will cost
upward of $135 billion this fiscal year. At the Internal Revenue Service, a DOGE-
What Elon Musk Didn’t Budget For: Firing
Workers Costs Money, Too
driven exodus of 22,000 employees would cost about $8.5 billion in revenue in 2026
alone, according to figures from the Budget Lab at Yale University. The total
number of departures is expected to be as many as 32,000.
Neither of these estimates includes the cost to taxpayers of defending DOGE’s
moves in court. Of about 200 lawsuits and appeals related to Mr. Trump’s agenda,
at least 30 implicate the department.
“Not only is Musk vastly overinflating the money he has saved, he is not
accounting for the exponentially larger waste that he is creating,” said Max Stier,
the chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service. “He’s inflicted these costs
on the American people, who will pay them for many years to come.”
Mr. Stier and other experts on the federal work force said it did not have to be this
way. Federal law and previous government shutdowns offered Mr. Musk a legal
playbook for reducing the federal work force, a goal that most Americans support.
But Mr. Musk chose similar lightning-speed, blunt-force methods he used to
drastically cut Twitter’s work force after he acquired the company in 2022.

agency’s employees will cost about $8.5 billion in revenue in 2026 alone, according to an estimate. Haiyun

“The law is clear,” said Jeri Buchholz, who over three decades in public service
handled hiring and firing at seven federal agencies, including NASA and the
Defense Intelligence Agency. “They can do all the things they are currently doing,
but they can’t do them the way they’re doing them. They can either start over and
do it right, or they can be in court for forever.”
Harrison W. Fields, a White House spokesman, defended DOGE’s cuts and called
the $150 billion that the administration had saved “monumental and historic.”
“It’s important to realize that doing nothing has a cost, too, and these so-called
experts and groups are conveniently absent when looking at the costs of doing
nothing,” he said.
On the I.R.S., he said, “Every single cut has been done to make the government
more efficient and not to be a burden to the American people or cut any critical
resources or programs they rely on.”
Based on the latest available information, the DOGE cuts have targeted at least 12
percent of the 2.4 million civilian employees in the federal work force. But a wide
gap exists between DOGE’s planned cuts and the number of people who actually
leave.
Buyouts and firings initially trimmed about 100,000 workers — thousands fewer
people than those who typically retire in a year, according to Office of Personnel
Management figures. At least one-quarter of those 100,000 workers have been
rehired at full pay, most after judges ruled that their firings were illegal and some
after Mr. Musk said DOGE had “accidentally” sacked workers safeguarding
nuclear weapons, ensuring aviation safety and combating bird flu and Ebola.
When judges ordered that the workers be hired back, the government put them on
paid leave, meaning taxpayers would foot the cost of rehiring them, plus the
salaries they collected while staying home.
Layoffs of 10,000 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services
wiped out the entire team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
combating H.I.V. among mothers and children around the world. In an interview,
two public health physicians said they were caught off guard because the team’s
work always had bipartisan support. They were facing termination on June 2 and
said they wanted to return to work but did not know to whom to make their case.
Mr. Musk’s methods have cast a pall over the latest effort by an American
president to trim the federal bureaucracy, as most Americans say they want. In
congressional town halls and interviews, even Trump voters have said they are
tired of Mr. Musk’s bloodletting. In a poll released this month, 58 percent of those
surveyed said they disapproved of how Mr. Musk was handling DOGE’s work, and
60 percent disapproved of Mr. Musk himself.
Are you a federal worker? We want to hear from you.
The Times would like to hear about your experience as a federal worker under the second
Trump administration. We may reach out about your submission, but we will not publish
any part of your response without contacting you first.
‘We Will Make Mistakes’
A week after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the Office of Personnel Management sent a
now infamous email to more than two million federal workers with the subject line
“Fork in the Road.” They were told they could either resign and be paid through
September or risk being sacked down the road.
The email ignited anger and confusion over whether DOGE had the legal authority
to pay workers through September. Federal employee unions sued, but a judge
allowed the program to go forward. About 75,000 people left, or about three
percent. If the administration does not renege on its offer, it will be paying their
salaries into the fall.

The mass buyout did not favor highly rated performers nor distinguish crucial jobs
from nonessential ones, practices that guided furloughs during past government
shutdowns. Consequently, the administration wound up trying to reverse an
exodus of people in vital roles.
“We will make mistakes,” Mr. Musk told cabinet members in February. After he
boasted of feeding the United States Agency for International Development “into
the wood chipper,” a move a judge later found violated the Constitution, Mr. Musk
discovered that “one of the things we accidentally canceled very briefly was Ebola
prevention.” But his claim to have swiftly repaired the damage was inaccurate.
Separately, a New York Times investigation into cuts to the National Nuclear
Security Administration illustrates the effect of the buyouts on efforts to safeguard
and modernize the nation’s nuclear weapons. Of more than 130 people who were
fired or accepted DOGE’s invitation to quit, at least 27 were engineers, 13 were
program or project analysts, 12 were program or project managers, and five were
physicists or scientists.
Four of these employees were specialists handling the secure transport of nuclear
materials, and a half dozen worked in the agency unit that builds reactors for
nuclear submarines.
“Those are such hard jobs to fill, because people could make as much or more
money working for the plant or laboratory itself,” said Jill Hruby, who led the
National Nuclear Security Administration during the Biden administration.
Several people on the nuclear safety team found new jobs with the government
contractors they once supervised. Across government, a disproportionate number
of professionals in high demand by the private sector have quit, according to Mr.
Stier.
“There are plenty of people who are best in class who are sticking it out because
they’re so purpose-driven,” he said. “But it’s easier for someone who has options to
say, ‘This is crazy, I’m not going to do this anymore,’ and go someplace else.”
‘Money Being Deliberately Wasted’
In mid-February, the Office of Personnel Management targeted all 220,000 of the
federal government’s probationary employees, who are new or newly promoted
professionals serving a one- to two-year trial period with fewer worker protections.
They included a cadre of younger, tech-savvy professionals hired at great expense
to replace a wave of baby boomer retirees. Hiring and training them cost about
$10,000 for a clerical worker to more than $1 million for an elite spy.
“This is the equivalent of a major-league baseball franchise firing all of their minor-
league players,” said Kevin Carroll, a former C.I.A. officer and lawyer who
represents some of the fired workers. “It’s a huge amount of money being
deliberately wasted.”
About 24,000 probationary employees across nearly 20 agencies had been fired by
March 13, when a federal judge in Maryland ruled that the cuts were illegal and
ordered the agencies to rehire the workers, but the government appealed and the
legal wrangling continues. By law, probationary employees can only be fired for
cause, typically for poor performance, Judge James K. Bredar of the Federal
District Court in Maryland said in a lengthy ruling.
The Treasury Department in Washington last month. A federal judge in Maryland
ruled that the firing of probationary workers was illegal and ordered agencies to rehire

He ordered the government to recall the fired workers, including 7,600 from the
Treasury Department, 5,700 at the Agriculture Department and more than 3,200 at
the Department of Health and Human Services, according to court filings. But the
administration instead put them on paid leave, where they collect annual salaries
averaging $106,000 while waiting in limbo.
For each probationary worker DOGE idled, the government lost thousands of
dollars it spent on recruitment, hiring incentives, security clearances and training,
an investment normally recouped over years of service. In one case, a fired
probationary employee with the Department of Health and Human Services
received a pay raise after she was reinstated and put on paid leave.
The administration cut about 400 probationary workers at the Federal Aviation
Administration after multiple plane crashes, including one in Washington in
January that killed 67 people. The layoffs included maintenance mechanics and
aviation safety assistants.
The C.I.A. confirmed last month that some officers hired in the past two years had
been summoned to a location away from the agency’s headquarters in Langley, Va.,
and asked to surrender their credentials to security personnel. About 80 officers
were let go.
Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence
Committee, said it cost $400,000 to get a C.I.A. recruit through the security
clearance process and specialized training.
Inflicting Pain
The theatrics around the firings, including an appearance by Mr. Musk at a
conservative political convention waving a chain saw, suggest they are also about
inflicting pain on a bureaucracy Mr. Trump perceives as a subversive “deep state.”
That was a goal for federal employees set by Russell T. Vought, who now leads the
Office of Management and Budget. “When they wake up in the morning, we want
them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the
villains,” Mr. Vought told a conservative gathering in 2023.

Harbor, Md., in February. Eric Lee/The New York Times
Ms. Buchholz and Mr. Stier emphasize that the government is indeed inefficient
and needs reform. But by “gleefully torturing people,” Ms. Buchholz said, DOGE
has hurt the government’s ability to recruit young, talented workers to lead a
modernization.
“This country historically has had an independent public service that attracts
people focused on service to Americans,” Ms. Buchholz said. “But this
administration values the kind of service you get from political appointees, who
serve at the president’s pleasure.”

Devorah Lev-Tov,NYT,1,Business,4/26/2025,"How Sarah Paiji Yoo, the Co-Founder of Blueland, Spends Her Sundays","Sarah Paiji Yoo started her career in finance and then founded several start-ups,
mostly in the fashion and beauty worlds. But during parental leave after the birth
of her first child, she realized how many microplastics her family was inadvertently
consuming.
“I started to have mixed feelings around pushing people to buy more things, when
I didn’t feel like they needed it,” Ms. Yoo, 40, said. “On the other side of becoming a
mother, I realized I still loved working, and I still loved early-stage company
building, but I just needed more meaning in the work that I was doing.”
So in 2019 she co-founded Blueland, reimagining household cleaning products to
eliminate single-use plastic packaging. She appeared on “Shark Tank” (and scored
a deal) that same year.
Her company sells tablets that can be mixed with water in reusable bottles to make
things like hand soap and cleaning sprays, or dropped directly into a dishwasher,
washing machine or toilet. The tablets come in compostable paper packaging.
Ms. Yoo is originally from Cerritos, Calif., and moved to New York City 19 years
ago. She met her husband, Kenneth Yoo, at a bar; nine months after their first date,
the two were engaged. They had their son Noah in 2017. Colin followed in 2020. The

foursome moved into a five-bedroom co-op on the Upper West Side the next year.
MORNING SNUGGLES I don’t need an alarm clock on the weekends — I can
definitely rely on my kids to wake me up. These days it’s around 6:30, maybe 6:40
if we’re lucky. They run into our room and we usually bring them into bed, not only
because it’s a nice moment, but Ken and I are trying to squeeze in an extra few
minutes in bed.
RUNNING SOLO A new thing that started this year is I go for a quick solo run. I
turned 40 last year, and I think it’s just hitting me that exercise is important: being
strong, not falling when I get older, and just being able to be around as long as I
can. We live right by Riverside Park and it’s always a good reminder that, wow,
Manhattan is an island! I feel so grateful to live less than a five-minute walk from
the water.

COFFEE AND CROISSANTS I’ll run for 20 minutes and then I’ll swing back to pick
up my reusable mugs to bring with me to the coffee shop. There’s a new French
bakery that opened up nearby called La Farine Patisserie et Café. I love that it
replaced a gigantic Starbucks.
For the kids, it’s a chocolate croissant and a plain croissant, one for each. I will do a
baguette with butter and jam. One of the best parts of the weekend is I allow myself
to buy coffee. It just tastes better when somebody else makes it.

PLAY BALL We are a baseball family through and through. My husband played
Division I; he was a pitcher in college. So, many Sundays for our family in the
spring are occupied by a good amount of baseball. Noah plays Little League, and
Colin plays T-ball. Noah’s games are usually in Central Park or Randall’s Island on
Sundays.
Ms. Yoo stopped by a farmer’s market by the American Museum of Natural History on the Upper West

ECO-FRIENDLY ERRANDS On Sundays, we have this loop that we do. First,
there’s the farmer’s market by the American Museum of Natural History. There are
a few stands that we always hit up for our fresh produce and flowers; Wood Thrush
Farm is my absolute fave. We used to bring our compost to the market, but now
that the city rolled out the smart compost bins, we stop at one on the way. And if we
have any textiles that we wouldn’t donate, we hit up the textile drop-off at the
farmer’s market.
Ken and I both wear contact lenses and they aren’t recyclable by the city. What can
be recycled with the city is anything that’s hard and firm, but anything that’s soft
has to go through a different recycling stream that’s not available curbside. There’s
an optometrist near our house where we can drop off any used contact lenses. And
then we also drop off plastic film, bags and bubble wrap at the Fairway in our
neighborhood.
There’s still a lot of plastic that, unfortunately, is not recyclable, even with flexible
plastic recycling. For example, the kids want animal-shaped Cheddar crackers that
come in a chip bag with that inside plastic lining. I think these are things that, in
my heart of hearts, I would love for Blueland to also tackle — but probably not in
the next, realistically, 10 years.

GARDENING If the kids don’t have a birthday party or play date, we might stop by
the West Side Community Garden. I’m a member, even though we don’t have our
own plot yet. It’s a requirement as a member to volunteer four hours a month. I’m
on the flower committee and composting committee.
I SCREAM, YOU SCREAM Ken and I are firm believers: Weekends are for eating
ice cream. Noah loves gelato; he loves Amorino. I love Salt & Straw, and that they
encourage sampling. It’s also nice because they do the metal spoons for the
sampling. I would not feel comfortable if they were like, “Oh, here’s another single-
use, disposable spoon.” Colin and Ken love Gelateria Gentile. If we have time, the
kids will scooter and we’ll just hit up all three.

SOAP TEST When we can, Ken and I try to do a date night on Sundays. Typically,
his parents come in from Queens. When we get home, I’ll do some cleaning — as
much as they’re family, it’s still my mother-in-law! During that period, if there’s
anything I’m testing, I bring in my sons to help. It’s kind of fun, because my older
son is old enough to be interested. We might be dissolving new hand soap scents or
trying out new laundry tablets.
DATE NIGHT We love doing date night at, like, 5 p.m. The world is your oyster at 5
p.m. because you can get a lot of reservations. Our ideal date night is omakase and
a foot massage. We’ll typically go to a local walk-in massage place — one of the
ones where you just kind of sit in a chair in the open — and get a foot massage. And
then we’ll be home for bedtime.
EARLY TO BED I like to go to bed on Sundays very early, with the kids. I’m
admittedly really bad about getting enough sleep during the week. I’m trying to
embrace that we’re still in the moment of time where the kids still want to snuggle
in bed and still want me in their beds. It just feels so warm and it helps put me to
sleep in a way that I think I struggle with during the week.

Tony Romm,NYT,1,Business,4/27/2025,Trump’s Tariffs Prompt Wave of Lawsuits,"Somewhere along a roughly 7,500-mile journey that begins in Shenzhen, China,
there are 19 shipments bound for Rick Woldenberg, the chief executive of Learning
Resources, an educational toy company in Vernon Hills, Ill.
Eventually, the containers of puzzle cards, child binoculars and other products will
reach a port in the United States, and Mr. Woldenberg will face a difficult and
expensive decision. He can pay the sky-high tariffs that President Trump has
imposed on most foreign goods, or forgo at least some of the much-needed
inventory, perhaps imperiling his bottom line.
Mr. Woldenberg expects to do a bit of both. But he has also opted for a more
aggressive course of action, joining a growing roster of opponents now legally
challenging Mr. Trump’s ability to issue some of the tariffs in the first place.
Trump’s Tariffs Prompt Wave of Lawsuits as
States and Businesses Fight Back

inbox.
Nearly four weeks into a costly global trade war with no end in sight, Mr. Trump is
facing a barrage of lawsuits from state officials, small businesses and even once-
allied political groups, all contending that the president cannot sidestep Congress
and tax virtually any import at levels to his liking.
The lawsuits carry great significance, not just because the tariffs have roiled
financial markets and threatened to plunge the United States into a recession. The
legal challenges also stand to test Mr. Trump’s claims of expansive presidential
power, while illustrating the difficult calculation that his opponents face in deciding
whether to fight back and risk retribution.
None of the lawsuits filed this month are supported by major business lobbying
groups, even though many organizations — including the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce and the Business Roundtable — have been sharply critical of the
president’s tariffs and lobbied to lessen their impact. The chamber privately
debated bringing a lawsuit, but ultimately decided it was “not the best course of
action at this time,” said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president of the group.
“Engaging the administration in order to achieve a quick and immediate reduction
in tariffs has the best chance of aiding businesses,” he said.

Instead, the battle has been left to a scattered yet growing roster of litigants,
including Mr. Woldenberg, whose lawyers sued on Tuesday. In an interview, he said
the tariffs had become so costly that he had “nothing to lose” by taking legal action.
“I’m going to do everything in my power to keep our company healthy, but we’re
hobbled,” he said.
Last week, a dozen Democratic attorneys general from states including Colorado,
New York and Oregon also asked a federal judge to block many of Mr. Trump’s
tariffs on grounds that they had “upended the constitutional order and brought
chaos to the American economy.” California sued earlier this month, claiming the
president’s policies harmed its economy and budget.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The Business
Roundtable also did not respond to a request for comment.
At the heart of the legal wrangling is a 1970s law, the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act, which enables the president to order trade embargoes, set
sanctions and limit foreign investment to ward off adversaries abroad.
Mr. Trump invoked that law to impose his initial duties on Chinese exports, in what
he described as an effort to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States. He also
used those powers to establish a 10 percent tax on exports from nearly every other
country and to justify what he calls “reciprocal” tariffs, which will charge even
steeper duties on countries including U.S. allies. For evidence of an emergency, Mr.
Trump primarily pointed to the trade deficit — the difference between what the
United States exports to other nations and what it imports.
No president before Mr. Trump had ever imposed such import taxes under the
emergency law, which does not once mention the word “tariff.” That omission has
set the stage for a series of pivotal legal clashes, hinging in part on whether the law
truly empowers the president “without actually, explicitly saying tariffs,” said Ted
Murphy, a co-leader of the global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice at the
law firm Sidley Austin.
The latest lawsuit arrived Thursday from the Pacific Legal Foundation, a group
with reported ties to the conservative donor Charles Koch. On behalf of a clothing
company, a board game designer and other small businesses, the group faulted Mr.
Trump for imposing an “unlawful and unconstitutional” 145 percent tariff on
Chinese goods, resulting in higher prices for American businesses.
Jamey Stegmaier, a co-founder of Stonemaier Games and a plaintiff in the case,
said his company had more than 250,000 board games and other products on order
that it could not easily import from China, unless it was willing to pay a “total tariff
tax of around $1.5 million.”
The decision to sue was the “right thing” but still a difficult choice, Mr. Stegmaier
said, citing a fear of retribution from Mr. Trump. “It’s kind of a scary proposition to
oppose the administration right now,” he said.
Another legal group with ties to Mr. Koch and the conservative financier Leonard
A. Leo sued early this month on behalf of a Florida company facing high costs from
the president’s tariffs on China. Mr. Leo is a co-chairman of the Federalist Society,
which has advised Mr. Trump on judicial appointments.
The organization behind the lawsuit, the New Civil Liberties Alliance, does not
disclose its full range of donors, nor do any of its like-minded peers, making it
difficult to determine the exact driving financial force behind each of the new tariff
cases.

does not have,” said Rob Bonta, the attorney general of California. The New York Times
In a separate lawsuit, two members of one of the largest tribes in the United States
claimed that Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Canada violated treaty rights, and they asked a
judge to halt taxes on imports arriving at key points of entry.
Rob Bonta, the Democratic attorney general of California, said his state’s tariff
lawsuit was similar to its other legal battles with Mr. Trump and came down to the
“core issue of executive authority.”
“Our position has been clear, time and time again, that we will not allow this
president to exert authority he does not have,” Mr. Bonta said.
Mr. Trump has said he is moving forward with tariffs in order to raise billions of
dollars in revenue, encourage more domestic manufacturing and force America’s
trading partners to make concessions, including dropping tariffs on U.S. goods.
Without the economic emergency law, the president could have been forced to use
much slower and narrower paths to tariffs, as he did with sector-specific levies
including those on the auto industry.
Greta Peisch, a former trade official who is a partner at the law firm Wiley Rein,
said those tariffs were a more “established practice,” arising from federal
investigations into those industries, so challenging them would be an “uphill
battle.”
In enacting the economic emergency law in 1977, Congress sought to curtail
presidential powers after past commanders in chief had overused emergency
declarations. President Richard M. Nixon had even tapped a precursor trade
statute to impose his own 10 percent duty on imports, which similarly drew a court
challenge, though the president prevailed.
Decades later, lawyers for Mr. Trump have cited that legislative history to argue
that they can impose tariffs in response to economic emergencies — primarily
because Congress never explicitly said they could not. That position has put the
administration at odds with constitutional scholars who take the view that the
executive branch cannot claim powers that are not expressly granted to it.
“The president doesn’t have authority outside of authorities delegated to him by
Congress to issue tariffs,” said Jeffrey Schwab, a senior counsel at the Liberty
Justice Center, a nonprofit with past ties to Richard Uihlein, an Illinois industrialist
and a Republican megadonor.
This month, the group sued the Trump administration on behalf of small
businesses that say the recent tariffs have harmed them. That included Victor
Schwartz, the founder of VOS Selections, a New York City company that imports
specialty wine, spirits and sake.
For the moment, Mr. Schwartz said, his company has been mostly unscathed,
securing its latest shipments before the highest tariffs take effect. Soon, though, he
may have to delay orders, cancel them or make other cuts, he predicted.
Faulting “billionaires sitting around doing nothing,” Mr. Schwartz added of his
choice to join the legal battle: “I just felt like, ‘Put up or shut up.’”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/us/politics/trump-tariffs-lawsuits.html
Ginia Bellafante,NYT,1,Business,4/26/2025,Harvard’s War With Trump Forces Question of How Endowments Should Be Spent,"Among Harvard University’s many distinctions remains the fact it is the oldest
continuing corporation in the Western Hemisphere. The designation originates in a
charter, authorizing a board of officers to oversee the college’s finances, property
and receipt of gifts. Nearing his death in 1638, John Harvard, a Puritan minister,
left half his estate to the institution that would soon bear his name. Five years later
came a contribution of 100 pounds from Ann Radcliffe to underwrite Harvard’s first
scholarships. The university’s funds, as the historian Bruce Kimball has noted, are
the oldest perpetual investments in the United States.
At $53.2 billion, Harvard’s endowment is the largest in the world, with more than 70
percent of its portfolio given over to interests in hedge funds and private equity.
The endowment does not include its real estate, which encompasses acres of land
across the river in Boston, parcels of which the university purchased for $88
million over several years in the 1990s, anonymously to avoid the possibility of
paying more. In 2023, the university’s chief investment officer, a title absent from
any 17th-century charter, made $7.6 million. These figures can breed confusion, if
not hostility, among the many people whose lives will never be touched by
Massachusetts Hall.
Harvard’s Endowment Is $53.2 Billion. What
Should It Be For?
The Trump administration’s war against higher education for what it insists is a
dangerous culture of intellectual inflexibility has forced a debate about capital as
central now as the vast underlying disagreements over values. The endowment of
the University of Pennsylvania, to take one example, stands at three and a half
times the municipal budget of Philadelphia. If universities can claim assets like
this, it can be hard to understand what keeps them from releasing funds to cover
the research dollars the government is taking away in the name of eradicating
“wokeness.”
Unlike Columbia, which bowed to the White House, Harvard resisted. In retaliation,
the government froze $2.2 billion in grant funding and threatened to revoke its tax-
exempt status. Harvard has since sued the government, arguing that it cannot
interfere with the university’s right to free speech, “to advance its own vision of
ideological balance.”
Harvard might choose to go deeper into its reserves to compensate for losses. Or it
might elect to take on more debt, or roll out a fund-raising campaign in the name of
defending academic freedom — The Harvard Crimson reported that more than $1
million in online donations came in within 24 hours of the university’s announcing
it would not concede. This month, both former President Barack Obama and
Lawrence Summers, who had presided over Harvard and the U.S. Treasury, made
the point that the endowments of rich universities were there to be activated in a
crisis and did not exist, as Mr. Summers put it in a guest essay in The New York
Times, “to simply be envied or admired.”
For the millions of Americans who do not pay attention to Ivy League investment
strategy, that might not seem like an especially defiant proposition. But the idea
abrades fiercely held tradition. It is a commandment of managing any trust, but
especially university endowments, that the principal go untouched. If you suggest
to academic bureaucrats that there must be a way for huge endowments to cover
prospective cuts in government funding — and you are not Larry Summers — they
will look at you as if you were a child wondering why it is unwise to leave raw eggs
out in the sun.
Recently, university administrators have unleashed a PowerPoint of clichés to
explain what endowments, with their significant spending limitations, are not. An
endowment is not a “piggy bank” or a “checking account” or a “rainy day fund” (to
which some reasonably wonder, “Why not?”).
What endowments are becomes considerably more complicated — a matter of
existential priority as much as it is a question of practical application, one leading
inevitability to a reckoning with the ideals that wealthy universities are ultimately
meant to serve.
The Circuitous Logic of Infinite Growth
Harvard has sued the government, arguing that it cannot interfere with the university’s right to free

Concerted efforts to raise funds among alumni began at Williams College in 1821.
But it was Charles Eliot, Harvard’s president 50 years later, who brought a focus to
long-term financial planning, shaken as he was by the loss of his family’s fortune in
the Panic of 1857. Mr. Eliot is featured in “Wealth Cost and Price in American
Higher Education,” Mr. Kimball’s excellent book on the history of college financing.
In it, he charts two momentous periods in the history of endowments. The first
came at the turn of the last century with the surge of wealth produced by the
Industrial Revolution, which gave way to so much philanthropy and the founding of
universities like Stanford, Vanderbilt and Carnegie Mellon.
The next era took shape in the late 1980s and ’90s with what became known as the
Yale Model, pioneered by David Swensen, who in 1985 left a career at Lehman
Brothers to run Yale’s endowment. Mr. Swensen’s innovation was to redirect
investments away from conventional formulas for allocations mostly held in stocks
and bonds and toward private equity, hedge and venture capital funds, as well as
real estate. Over his 35-year tenure he averaged returns of 13.1 percent. Like
Warren Buffett, Mr. Swensen became a guru in the field, with acolytes spread out
across the academic ecosystem swelling wealth in elite higher education.
As a doctoral student in economics, Mr. Swensen had been mentored by James
Tobin, a Nobel laureate whose work provides the dominant thinking around
endowments. In an influential paper published in 1974, Mr. Tobin introduced the
idea of “intergenerational equity,” a phrase woven through annual reports. “The
trustees of an endowed institution,” Mr. Tobin wrote “are the guardians of the
future against the claims of the present.” This emerged as a mantra embedded in
the assumption that universities are “immortal.”
Running the Ford Foundation in the late 1960s, McGeorge Bundy, a former
presidential adviser, had already been worrying about the costs of higher
education. He commissioned studies that produced two enduring
recommendations — the first that endowment managers invest more aggressively,
in growth stocks, to build wealth rather than merely avert losses and the second
that they spend their annual earnings prudently, according to a rule.
For decades universities have taken it as catechism to spend their year-to-year
earnings at a rate of no more than 5 percent of the total endowment (often less).
Foundations as well as cultural and religious institutions are required by law to
spend a 5 percent minimum; colleges and universities are not but do so because
they think it is sound policy. (A few states, including Massachusetts, do have laws
requiring “prudence” from universities.)
Morton Schapiro, a former president of Williams and later Northwestern,
described the origins of the standard as “completely arbitrary” and yet fortuitous.
“If you look back at the past 10 to 20 years, endowments have earned about 8
percent a year; inflation has been about 3 percent. Guess what? Five percent, it’s
turned out to be a remarkably good rule of thumb.”
At the most basic level, that annual draw helps pay for the business of keeping a
university going. Every year, the National Association of College and University
Business Officers issues a report on the strength of endowments and where the
money they generate ends up. The most recent looked at 658 institutions. About 48
percent of investment income went to student aid. Tuition, as high as it is, does not
cover the cost of an education at most places; about a quarter of the money, the
research showed, went to academic programs and maintaining facilities.
The fixation with infinite growth can hijack endowments to a circuitous logic,
making them problematic in ways that are surfacing now. Locked up in order to get
bigger, they become harder to access when they are needed, and the bigger they
get, the more vulnerable they become to popular resentments.
As the most prestigious universities have followed the exalted fortunes of Wall
Street, they have subjected themselves to the animosities leveled against the
financial class; they can seem like the rich friend showing up for lunch with a
Vacheron Constantin on her wrist, complaining about the cost of renovating her
place in Jackson Hole while insisting on splitting the check.
A Mark of Status
Some observers of the campus upheaval have noted that Columbia, rather than acquiesce to the
government’s demands to preserve $400 million in grant money, might have borrowed against its

From one vantage, huge endowments are an invention of Wall Street, justified as
virtue. Universities defend them as an essential means of securing the most
talented faculty, supporting the most valuable research, delivering the most aid.
But universities imagine themselves as quasi democracies in a way that Goldman
Sachs does not. When every constituency is given a voice, many opinions are
rendered. As Derek Bok, another former Harvard president, once pointed out, a
huge endowment is a disadvantage to the extent that it elevates expectations that
surplus ought to be targeted toward righting perceived injustices.
Endowments are not meant to be tools of politics, but they inevitably appear that
way when donors writing $50 million checks assert priorities that may not be
politically neutral. The competition for contributions can force concessions to
philanthropic interest, vanity and control. Much of what cannot be easily freed in
any single fund falls under the category of “restricted use,” which typically means
that it has been earmarked according to donor prerogative. Very few people turn
over six or seven figures to their alma mater and say, “Enjoy!”
Even in quiet times, outsize endowments invite skepticism given the inequities
they expose in education more broadly. In recent years, a number of small liberal
arts colleges have closed because they could not afford the alternative. For every
undergraduate enrolled in Columbia or Cornell, 92 more are going to ailing, public
two-year colleges.
Whether it should be the concern of the richest schools to help the poorest, the
belief that elite universities have stockpiled too much money is shared across
political affiliations. Two years ago, Zohran Mamdani, a progressive New York
State assemblyman now running for mayor, introduced failed legislation to end
more than $321 million in annual property tax exemption for New York University
and Columbia and divert that money to the city’s troubled public university system.
There are proposals from Republicans in Congress to increase the tax on large
endowments, potentially to 14 percent, much higher than the 1.4 percent put in
place eight years ago. Assuming a 10 percent return, that would leave Harvard with
a tax bill of about $742,000,000, roughly equal to what it spent on financial aid last
year. But you can go around and round. If Harvard raised its endowment draw,
however sacrilegiously, to 7 percent, it would add about $1.3 billion to its budget.
Undoubtedly the prospect of higher taxes and the realities of a chaotic stock
market have made the notion of tapping endowment income more robustly seem
even less attractive to trustees. But those who consider endowments essentially
inviolate dismiss some of the workarounds. It is true that as endowments have
become more heavily invested in hedge funds and private equity, they have
become less liquid. But there are secondary markets for selling positions in some of
these funds if a need for cash is urgent. There are reports that Harvard is now
considering this option.
One of the great luxuries of having a lot of money is the ability to borrow against it,
often cheaply. Princeton University’s president, Christopher Eisgruber, has become
one of the most prominent critics of the Trump administration’s antagonisms
toward the academy. In response to the federal government’s freezing of several
dozen grants, the university, rather than hike up its draw, has issued bonds as a
means of raising cash.
Some observers of the recent campus upheaval have noted that Columbia, the
largest landowner in New York City, rather than acquiesce to the government’s
demands to preserve $400 million in grant money, might have borrowed against its
real estate, the value of which stands apart from its $14 billion endowment.
Harvard, with its triple-A rating, has issued more than $1 billion in bonds since
March. “For a bondholder, the only question is: ‘Will I be paid?’” said Larry Ladd, a
former budget director at the university who is now a consultant. “If Harvard were
liquidated, they would get paid,” he added.
And while many restrictions are imposed by donors, others are imposed by the
university itself, Mr. Schapiro of Williams and Northwestern explained to me
recently, “so they can be unrestricted.” Although it is difficult to pull off, and Mr.
Schapiro does not recommend it as protocol, he once approached the grandson of a
donor who had died long ago to ask if he could use the money for something other
than what was intended. The grandson said yes.
Years after Mr. Tobin delivered his immortality thesis, Henry B. Hansmann, an
economist and a professor at Yale Law School, published a retort, questioning what
was equitable about privileging a world long into the future over the exigencies of
the moment. Whatever lasting arguments his theory might have ignited seem to
have given way to an understanding of an endowment as an end in itself, a stand-in
for a university’s purpose, a rejection of the idea that underlying a belief in
institutional eternity is an alienating self-regard.
As Mr. Swensen, the pioneer of the Yale Model, once put it: “Short of beating an
archrival in football,” posting an endowment’s highest year-end result “ranks near
the top” of “institutional aspiration,” a mark of status with which it becomes
possible to raise more and more money. Modern universities are essentially
engaged in a contest of inverse ratio: Which can claim the most dramatic
differential between the amount of money piled up and the percentage of
applicants turned away.
The Trump administration has named 60 universities it plans to investigate; soon
enough, many will most likely have to wrestle with the questions Harvard and
Columbia have. If they believe they deserve to last forever, they might ask what
besides money they want to leave behind.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/26/business/harvard-endowment-trump.html
Karen Weise;Kenneth Chang,NYT,1,Business,4/28/2025,Amazon Launches First 27 Project Kuiper Internet Satellites,"The battle of billionaires in space between Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk has entered a
new arena: satellite internet.
Amazon, the company that Mr. Bezos started as an online bookseller three decades
ago, is now a merchandising behemoth, the owner of the James Bond franchise, a
seller of electronic gadgets like Echo smart speakers and one of the most powerful
providers of cloud computing.
So perhaps it is not a surprise that Amazon has now launched the first few of
thousands of satellites known as Project Kuiper to provide another option for
remaining connected in the modern world. The market for beaming high-speed
internet to the ground from orbit is currently dominated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX
rocket company, which operates a similar service, Starlink. Starlink, with
thousands of satellites in orbit and more launching nearly every week, already
serves several million customers around the world.
The company’s first 27 satellites were shipped to space and deployed into orbit on
Monday evening.
On Tuesday morning, Amazon said it had established communications with all of
the satellites, and the sequence of turning them on was “proceeding as planned.”
”While this is the first step in a much longer journey to launch the rest of our low
Earth orbit constellation,” Andy Jassy, the chief executive of Amazon, wrote in a
posting on X, “it represents an incredible amount of invention and hard work.”
When was the launch?
The satellite lifted off on Monday at 7:01 p.m. Eastern time from Cape Canaveral
Space Force Station in Florida. They were carried by an Atlas V, a rocket made by
United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.
The spacecraft deployed the Kuiper satellites in a circular orbit at 280 miles above
the surface. The satellites’ propulsion system will then gradually raise that orbit to
an altitude of 393 miles.
“This launch marks the first step towards the future of our partnership and
increased launch cadence,” Tory Bruno, United Launch Alliance’s chief executive,
said in a statement.
What is Project Kuiper?
Project Kuiper will be a constellation of internet satellites intended to provide high-
speed data connections to almost every point on Earth. Doing this successfully will
require thousands of satellites, and Amazon’s goal is to operate more than 3,200 in
the years to come.
The company will compete with SpaceX’s Starlink, a service that was originally
marketed primarily to residential customers.
While Kuiper also aims for that market, particularly in remote areas, it will also be
integrated with Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing offering,
which is popular with large corporations and governments around the world. That
might make it more attractive to businesses that involve satellite imagery or
weather forecasting that not only need to move large amounts of data across the
internet, but also to perform calculations on the data.
Ground stations will connect the Kuiper satellites to the web services
infrastructure in a manner that could also allow companies to communicate with
their own remote equipment. For example, Amazon has suggested that energy
companies could use Kuiper to monitor and control remote wind farms or offshore
drilling platforms.
In October 2023, two prototype Kuiper satellites were launched to test the
technology. Amazon said that the tests were successful. Those prototypes were
never meant to serve in the operational constellation, and after seven months they
were nudged back into the atmosphere, where they burned up. The company said it
has since updated the designs of “every system and subsystem on board.”
“There’s a big difference between launching two satellites and launching 3,000
satellites,” said Rajeev Badyal, an Amazon executive in charge of Kuiper, in a
promotional video ahead of the launch.

satellite processing facility at Cape Canaveral last month. Amazon, via Agence France-Presse

When will Amazon provide internet service from space?
Amazon told the Federal Communications Commission in 2020 that service would
begin after it had deployed its first 578 satellites. The company has said that it
expects to connect customers to the internet later this year.
While a fully functional constellation needs thousands of satellites, the company
can offer service in specific regions with far fewer in orbit before expanding to
more global coverage later on.
The F.C.C.’s approval of the constellation came with a requirement that at least half
the satellites needed to be deployed by July 30, 2026. Industry analysts say the
company could get an extension if it has demonstrated substantial progress by
then.
Getting the satellites into orbit also depends on rocket launches occurring on
schedule, which can be a problem if enough rockets are not available. Amazon also
needs to build hundreds of ground stations, to relay their signals to users.
Is space too crowded for both SpaceX and Amazon?
In 2000, there were fewer than 1,000 satellites in Earth orbit.
Today, SpaceX alone operates more than 7,000 Starlink satellites, and it hopes to
increase that total to 42,000.
Other megaconstellations, including Project Kuiper, could multiply the number of
satellites in the region called low-Earth orbit by several times, and will require
careful orbital traffic control to avoid colliding with each other or with other debris
in low Earth orbit.
But satellites like Kuiper and Starlink do not stay in low Earth orbit indefinitely. At
the end of their service life, they are intentionally removed from orbit to burn up in
the atmosphere. Even if they fail completely, air resistance alone will pull them to
their destruction within a few years so they will not add to the long-term clutter of
space.
What other rockets will launch Kuiper to orbit?
In April 2022, Amazon announced that it was purchasing up to 83 launches
carrying Kuiper satellites, on a series of rockets. Some would fly on New Glenn, a
powerful, voluminous rocket made by Jeff Bezos’ spaceflight company, Blue Origin.
Others would lift off on a Vulcan, a new rocket from United Launch Alliance. Other
batches will travel on the Ariane 6 from Arianespace, a European rocket company.
These three vehicles are new, and have only been launched a handful of times.
In December 2023, Amazon also purchased three Falcon 9 launches for 2025 from
SpaceX, its direct competitor for Kuiper. That decision was made months after a
pension fund sued Amazon, saying that the company’s board of trustees had acted
in bad faith in arranging almost all of the Kuiper launches on the unproven rockets
while ignoring the Falcon 9, which is the dominant rocket in modern spaceflight
and likely to be the less expensive one.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/science/amazon-kuiper-launch-

Michael M. Grynbaum;Benjamin Mullin,NYT,1,Business,4/27/2025,‘60 Minutes’ Rebukes Paramount On-Air Over Executive Producer’s Exit,"In an extraordinary on-air rebuke, one of the top journalists at “60 Minutes”
directly criticized the program’s parent company in the final moments of its
Sunday night CBS telecast, its first episode since the program’s executive producer,
Bill Owens, announced his intention to resign.
“Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways,” the correspondent, Scott
Pelley, told viewers. “None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the
independence that honest journalism requires.”
A spokesman for Paramount had no immediate comment, and has previously
declined to comment on Mr. Owens’s departure.
Mr. Owens stunned the show’s staff on Tuesday when he said he would leave the
highest-rated program in television news over disagreements with Paramount,
CBS’s corporate parent, saying, “It’s clear the company is done with me.”
‘60 Minutes’ Chastises Its Corporate Parent in
Unusual On-Air Rebuke
Mr. Owens’s comments were widely reported in the press last week. The show’s
decision to repeat those grievances on-air may have exposed viewers to the
serious tensions between “60 Minutes” and its corporate overseers for the first
time.
Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of Paramount, has been intent on
securing approval from the Trump administration for a multibillion-dollar sale of
her media company to a studio run by the son of Larry Ellison, the tech billionaire.
President Trump sued CBS last year, claiming $10 billion in damages, in a case
stemming from a “60 Minutes” interview with the 2024 Democratic presidential
nominee, Kamala Harris, that Mr. Trump said was deceptively edited. Ms.
Redstone has expressed her desire to settle Mr. Trump’s lawsuit, although legal
experts have called the case far-fetched.
In his remarks on Sunday night’s telecast, Mr. Pelley presented Mr. Owens’s
decision to resign as an effort to protect “60 Minutes” from further interference.
“He did it for us and you,” Mr. Pelley told viewers of the show, which began airing
in 1968. “Stories we pursued for 57 years are often controversial — lately, the
Israel-Gaza War and the Trump administration. Bill made sure they were accurate
and fair. He was tough that way. But our parent company, Paramount, is trying to
complete a merger. The Trump administration must approve it.”
After “60 Minutes” ran a segment in January about the war between Israel and
Hamas, Ms. Redstone complained to CBS executives about what she considered
the segment’s unfair slant. A day later, CBS appointed a veteran producer to a new
role involving journalistic standards. She reviewed certain “60 Minutes” segments
that were deemed sensitive.
Representatives for Mr. Trump and for Paramount are involved in settlement talks,
and mediation is expected to start this week.
Mr. Pelley’s on-air monologue on Sunday night evoked a previous moment of public
discord between “60 Minutes” and its corporate overseers.
In 1995, also in a closing note to viewers, the correspondent Mike Wallace said on
air that the program had chosen not to broadcast an interview with a former
tobacco industry executive because managers at CBS News had given in to legal
pressure. “60 Minutes” ultimately aired the interview, and the episode was later
dramatized in “The Insider,” a 1999 movie starring Al Pacino as Lowell Bergman, a
“60 Minutes” producer.
Sunday’s “60 Minutes” episode also featured a segment that examined the Trump
administration’s decision to reduce funding to the National Institutes of Health,
including an interview with a former director who expressed his concerns about
adverse effects on Americans’ health.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/business/media/60-minutes-scott-pelley-paramount.html
Jeanna Smialek;Liz Alderman;Melissa Eddy,NYT,1,Business,4/27/2025,Europe’s Pharma Industry Braces for Pain as Trump Tariff Threat Looms,"Insulin, heart treatments and antibiotics have flowed freely across many borders
for decades, exempt from tariffs in a bid to make medicine affordable. But that
could soon change.
For months, President Trump has been promising to impose higher tariffs on
pharmaceuticals as part of his plan to reorder the global trading system and bring
key manufacturing industries back to the United States. This month, he said
pharmaceutical tariffs could come in the “not too distant future.”
If they do, the move would have serious — and wildly uncertain — consequences
for drugs made in the European Union.

Pharmaceutical products and chemicals are the bloc’s No. 1 export to America.
Among them are the weight-loss blockbuster Ozempic, cancer treatments,
cardiovascular drugs and flu vaccines. Most are name-brand drugs that yield a
large profit in the American market, with its high prices and vast numbers of
consumers.
“These are critical things that keep people alive,” said Léa Auffret, who heads
international affairs for BEUC, the European Consumer Organization. “Putting
them in the middle of a trade war is highly concerning.”
European companies could react to Mr. Trump’s tariffs in a range of ways. Some
pharmaceutical companies trying to dodge the tariffs have already announced
plans to increase production in the United States, which Mr. Trump wants. Others
could decide to move production there later.
Other companies appear to be staying put, but could raise their prices to cover the
tariffs, pushing up costs for patients. And higher prices could affect not only
American consumers, but also patients in Europe. Some companies have begun to
argue that Europe should create more favorable conditions for their businesses by
dismantling some of the rules that keep drug prices down.
Or some middle ground could play out: Companies might shift their financial
profits to the United States for accounting purposes to avoid import charges, even
as they leave their physical factories overseas to avoid the expenses of moving and
challenges of having to set up new supply chains.
Ms. Auffret’s group has already warned European officials that they must not hit
back at an attack on the important industry by tariffing American drugs in return:
Tit for tat would come at too serious of a cost to European consumers.
But the pharmaceutical sector is complicated. Agreements with insurance
companies and government agencies can make it difficult to rapidly adjust prices
for branded drugs, while government regulations can make moving both a
challenge and a long-term commitment. The upshot is that no one can confidently
predict the outcome.

Even as Mr. Trump has paused his so-called “reciprocal” tariffs in favor of an
across-the-board rate of 10 percent during the hiatus, he has left in place some
industry-specific tariffs and made clear that computer chips and pharmaceutical
products would be next. The United States recently kicked off investigations into
both sectors, a first step toward hitting them with tariffs.
Many industry experts expect that the new tariffs could be 25 percent, in line with
those on steel, aluminum and cars.
For the countries at the center of Europe’s drug industry, the possible tariffs are
particularly worrisome. That is especially true for Ireland, where pharmaceuticals
make up 80 percent of all exports to the United States.
Many drug companies originally moved to Ireland because it offers very low
corporate tax rates. But it has also worked to develop its pharmaceutical industry
and offers access to a highly skilled work force.
In recent years, the sector has grown rapidly. More than 90 pharmaceutical
companies are now based there, according to Ireland’s Foreign Direct Investment
Agency, and many of the biggest American drugmakers have operations in the
nation. Last year, Ireland’s pharma industry exported 58 billion euros, or about $66
billion, in pharmaceutical and chemical products to the United States.
“The Irish are smart, yes, smart people,” Mr. Trump said in March, while Prime
Minister Micheál Martin of Ireland was visiting the White House. “You took our
pharmaceutical companies and other companies,” he said. “This beautiful island of
five million people has got the entire U.S. pharmaceutical industry in its grasps.”
Now, tariffs could chip away at the benefits of manufacturing there — which is Mr.
Trump’s goal.
“In the U.S., we don’t make our own drugs anymore,” Mr. Trump said last week
from the Oval Office, adding that “the drug companies are in Ireland.”

Firms are already bracing. Companies have been rushing to export their
pharmaceuticals from Ireland and into the U.S. market before the gauntlet falls,
statistics suggest.
Nor is Ireland the only country affected. Germany, Belgium, Denmark and
Slovenia are also major exporters.
“It’s an enormous issue for Europe,” said Penny Naas, who leads a competitiveness
program for the think tank the German Marshall Fund and has long worked in
European public policy and corporate affairs.
European leaders have been reaching out to both American officials and the
industry. In addition to the Irish prime minister’s recent visit to the Oval Office, the
Irish foreign affairs minister traveled to Washington to meet with the commerce
secretary.
Ursula Von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the European
Union’s executive arm, has met in Brussels with the European Federation of
Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, the lobby group representing
Europe’s biggest drugmakers.
The industry is leveraging the moment to push for wish-list items, like less red
tape.
The European drug lobby group told Ms. von der Leyen that companies could shift
production or investment toward the United States to limit their exposure to Mr.
Trump’s tariffs, especially when faster approvals and easier access to capital are
making America more attractive.
At least 18 members of the group, which includes Bayer, Pfizer and Merck, have
planned nearly €165 billion in investments in the European Union over the next
five years. As much as half of that could shift to the United States, the federation
said. Nor is it alone in that prediction.
“Pharma needs more attractive conditions to produce in Europe,” said Dorothee
Brakmann, the director of Pharma Deutschland, Germany’s largest association of
pharmaceutical companies.
Such warnings seem to have teeth. Some companies have begun to lay out plans to
spend more in the United States; the firm Roche last week announced a $50 billion
American investment plan, the latest in a string of such announcements.
In commentary published last week, the chief executives of Novartis and Sanofi
suggested that less regulation was not enough to stem the bleeding. They argued
that “European price controls and austerity measures reduce the attractiveness of
its markets,” and that the bloc should pave the way for higher prices.

Industry executives have also warned that tariffs on the sector could disrupt
supply lines, impair patient access and dampen research and development.
“There’s a reason” that tariffs on medicines are set to zero, Joaquin Duato, the chief
executive of the drugmaker Johnson & Johnson, said on a recent earnings call. “It’s
because tariffs can create disruptions in the supply chain, leading to shortages.”
Ms. von der Leyen has emphasized similar concerns, warning that tariffs on the
pharmaceutical sector risk “implications for globally interconnected supply chains
and availability of medicines for European and U.S. patients alike.”
Pharmaceutical tariffs also hold another danger for the European Union.
The bloc has been trying to build up its ability to manufacture generic drugs, which
are medically essential but much less profitable than the name-brand products, and
are frequently made in Asia.
But if U.S. tariffs mean that generic drug manufacturers in China and India are
suddenly looking for customers outside of America, it could send a flood of
cheaper-than-usual pills toward Europe.
That could make it even more difficult for the European Union to establish a
domestic manufacturing base for generics, even as tariffs lure name-brand drug
production toward the United States.
“We do think that it’s likely that this is going to cause increased investment in the
U.S.,” said Diederik Stadig, a sectoral economist at ING. “The European
Commission needs to be on the ball.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/world/europe/tariffs-pharmaceuticals-drugs-medicine-trump.html
Andrew Duehren,NYT,1,Business,5/2/2025,Republicans Wrestle With Trump’s Demands for Tax Cuts,"It was easy to miss, but last weekend President Trump floated a fundamental
rewrite of the American tax code. In a social media post, and again in remarks to
reporters, Mr. Trump suggested the United States could stop taxing income under
$200,000 and instead rely on revenue from his extensive tariffs.
“It’ll take a little while before we do that, but we’re going to be cutting taxes, and
it’s possible we’ll do a complete tax cut,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Sunday.
“Because I think the tariffs will be enough to cut all of the income tax.”
The idea was news to Republicans on Capitol Hill already in the throes of
translating Mr. Trump’s impulses for cutting taxes into law.
Senator Mike Crapo, a Republican from Idaho who leads the Finance Committee,
said he had not heard from Mr. Trump or his staff about the proposal. “So I just
don’t know what that’s referencing,” he said.
Likewise in the House, where Republicans are preparing to release their first stab
at the tax bill in the coming days. “We aren’t having that discussion at all — it’s
never come up,” Representative Lloyd Smucker, a Republican from Pennsylvania
and a member of the Ways and Means committee, said of not collecting income
taxes on earnings under $200,000.
Even if they take a pass on Mr. Trump’s most recent notion, congressional
Republicans are straining to incorporate several of his previous tax proposals into
the legislation. Those include not taxing tips, overtime pay or Social Security
benefits, three of Mr. Trump’s campaign pledges that the White House has
continued to push in his second term.
House Republicans are planning to include those ideas in their version of the bill,
though their proposals are expected to be narrower than the blanket tax
exemptions Mr. Trump has advertised, according to lawmakers, staff and lobbyists
after the talks. Mr. Trump’s other ideas from the campaign trail, like allowing
Americans to deduct the cost of buying a generator, seem very likely to fall by the
way side.
While Republicans acknowledge they’ll now probably have to pass at least a couple
of Mr. Trump’s tax proposals, some still grouse about them.
“My beef with what’s being proposed right now, there’s no guiding principle other
than, ‘well, this is what President Trump promised on the campaign,’” said Senator
Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin. “I understand the political message
there, but let’s keep our tax code simple. I’d much rather lower the rates and keep
it simple, rather than do another little special carve-out deal.”
As with all of the tax cuts Republicans are considering, a chief concern about Mr.
Trump’s ideas is their cost. Without steps to curb their reach, the cost of the
campaign promises could balloon into the trillions, according to estimates from the
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Republicans are trying to limit how much they add to the deficit with the
legislation, forcing a parallel and politically treacherous negotiation over cuts to
spending on Medicaid and other programs that help low-income Americans. How
far Republicans can cut taxes, and what Mr. Trump’s ideas look like in practice, will
depend on how much in spending Republicans can ultimately agree to cut.
“I want to make sure that we get tax relief for hardworking Americans, which
seems to be the focus of those, but there is a finite amount of money as well,”
Senator Roger Marshall, a Republican from Kansas, said of Mr. Trump’s campaign
promises. “So I think the big debate is: How much money does the House want to
save?”
The leading proposal for not taxing tips — a bill crafted by Senator Ted Cruz,
Republican of Texas, and Representative Vern Buchanan, Republican of Florida —
would take a number of steps to limit the scope of the tax break.
Under their bill, Americans making more than a threshold that rises annually, set
at $160,000 this year, would still have to pay taxes on their tipped income. People
making under that limit would avoid income taxes only on the first $25,000 in tips
they receive, though they would still owe payroll taxes. To prevent all types of
workers from trying to claim the tax break, the bill tasks the Treasury Department
with limiting it to people in industries that traditionally receive tips.
It also excludes gig workers from the tax break. Some companies, including the
food-delivery service DoorDash, are lobbying for lawmakers to expand the tax
break to independent contractors. The company has invited its drivers, who work
as independent contractors rather than traditional employees, to write to members
of Congress about the issue, with nearly 40,000 of them doing so already.
“This is a matter of basic fairness — tips are tips,” Max Rettig, global head of public
policy at DoorDash, said in a statement.
While the details for not taxing tips are up in the air, Republicans expect their bill to
ultimately include limitations similar to what Mr. Cruz and Mr. Buchanan had in
their bill. Lawmakers said they were also trying to make sure the tax exemption
for overtime pay was targeted toward middle-and-low income Americans — and
would not create a gold rush in tax dodging for rich Americans. To hold down costs,
Republicans may approve the tax breaks only for the duration of Mr. Trump’s term.
Mr. Trump’s wish to not tax Social Security benefits is more complicated.
Republicans are using a special procedure called reconciliation to pass the tax
legislation without Democratic support. Reconciliation requires lawmakers to
follow a series of rules, one of which is that bills considered under the process
cannot affect Social Security’s finances.
To work around that prohibition, House Republicans, rather than directly changing
how Social Security benefits are taxed, are preparing to offer a more general tax
break to older Americans. Americans over 65 are already eligible for a slightly
larger standard deduction, and Republicans have considered a further expansion.
“If we can do a deduction that erases the tax burden that our seniors pay on their
Social Security income, for people within a certain income threshold, it equates to
the same thing,” said Representative Nicole Malliotakis, a New York Republican
and member of the Ways and Means Committee. “It’s eliminating their tax burden.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/republicans-trump-tax-cuts.html
Eshe Nelson,NYT,1,Business,4/28/2025,U.S. Dollar’s Weakness Creates an Opportunity for the Euro. Can It Last?,"President Trump’s shake-up of the global trade system has sent tremors through
the long-held view that the United States is the source of the world’s safest
financial assets. That’s  created an opportunity for Europe.
The market tumult in which investors simultaneously sold off the U.S. dollar,
American stocks and U.S. Treasury bonds eased last week as Mr. Trump backed off
his threats to fire the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, and Treasury
Secretary Scott Bessent tried to reassure foreign officials that trade deals would be
struck.
But many European officials attending the spring meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington last week were skeptical that the
uncertainty over Mr. Trump’s trade policy would dissipate any time soon. They said

the unpredictable nature of the Trump administration’s approach to setting policy
would not easily be forgotten. Instead, they saw the potential to attract investors to
European assets, from the euro to the bond market.
“We see that our stability, predictability and respect for the rule of law is already
proving a strength,” Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner responsible
for the trade bloc’s economy, said on Wednesday in a discussion on the sidelines of
the I.M.F. meetings. “We already have stronger investor interest in euro-
denominated assets.”
The most comprehensive indication that funds are flowing to Europe: Since the
beginning of April, the euro has gained 5.4 percent against the dollar, rising above
$1.13, the highest level since late 2021.
The question among policymakers and investors is whether the recent jump in the
euro and other euro-denominated assets is simply a short-term rebalancing of
portfolios that heavily favored the dollar or the beginning of a long-term trend in
which the euro firmly encroaches on the dollar’s role as the world’s dominant
currency.
A troubled past
“There’s a lot of enthusiasm about Europe,” Kristin J. Forbes, an economist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an interview.
She said the excitement about the euro reminded her of the currency’s founding in
1999, when some economists and policymakers raised the prospect of it replacing
the dollar. In its early years, the euro’s international use exceeded the combined
use of the currencies it replaced.
But then the euro was hit by crises. Despite having a monetary union of a dozen
members, including Germany, Europe’s largest economy, the region remained
politically fragmented, sapping confidence in the currency. The sovereign debt
crisis in 2012, followed by a decade of ultra low interest rates, meant the region’s
bonds offered low returns.
The euro is now used by 20 member countries and represents about 20 percent of
the world’s central banks foreign exchange reserves, a figure that has barely
budged in the past two decades. Thirty percent of global exports are invoiced in
euros, whereas more than half are in dollars.
Many European officials at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank
meetings in Washington were skeptical that the uncertainty over the U.S. trade policy
would dissipate any time soon. Jose Luis Magana/Associated Press
Speculation about new dominant currencies should be taken “cautiously,” Ms.
Forbes said, but there is more momentum behind the euro.
“This feels like it does have more legs because it is a combination of a stronger,
more unified Europe,” she said. “At the same time, there are more problems
emerging with U.S. dollar assets.”
Improvements have been made on some of the issues that previously deterred
foreign investors. Today, European bonds are providing better returns, and
investors trust that the European Central Bank will be the lender of last resort,
minimizing the risk that one country’s economic troubles could affect all euro
assets.
More safe assets
For investors, the most promising new development is the prospect of Germany
issuing about 1 trillion euros in additional government debt, known as bunds and
considered the safest euro-denominated assets.
For years, Germany’s strict fiscal conservatism has restrained the supply of bunds.
But last month, Parliament altered the borrowing limits anchored in its
constitution, the so-called debt brake, to allow the government to borrow hundreds
of millions of euros to invest in the military and infrastructure.
“There are cheers in Europe” because of Germany’s fiscal stimulus, said Kristalina
Georgieva, the I.M.F. managing director. “And it adds something that is not
tangible, but it is important — confidence.”
The demand for German debt has preceded any additional issuance. During the
recent market turmoil, bund prices rose, pushing down the yields, a clear sign of
investor interest. At the same time, yields on U.S. government bonds have moved
in the other direction. By the end of last week, the yield on 10-year bunds was 2.47
percent, reversing nearly all the increase that followed the stimulus
announcement.
Investors are also anticipating an increase in debt issued jointly by European
governments, an idea that has been proposed to finance more military spending
across the bloc. Economists have pointed out that this happened before: The
European Union issued more than 600 billion euros in bonds to finance post-
pandemic recovery programs. But that borrowing faced fierce opposition, and
future issuance would also struggle to win the backing of all the member states.
Although there has been confusion and frustration with Mr. Trump’s trade policies,
many European officials, including central bankers, emphasized the need for
Europe to seize this moment.
“This will be a time of creativity and pragmatism, getting things moving,” Olli
Rehn, the governor of the Finnish central bank, said in a speech. “I am very much
looking forward to this period as a positive challenge because we are very serious
about reinforcing common defense in Europe. Which will, by the way, need safe
assets.”
‘A long and hard road’
Optimism is growing about the role of the euro. Klaas Knot, the governor of the
Dutch central bank, said he had gone from being agnostic about the international
use of the euro to a “cautious believer.”
But he added that “the external strength” of the euro “is a reflection of internal
strength” in Europe, and governments need to go further to increase that strength,
he said in a speech on the sidelines of the meetings in Washington.
Officials must continue to deepen the single market that connects the bloc’s more
than 448 million people and enable them to trade and do businesses freely, Mr. Knot
said. Lawmakers, he said, also needed to build a single capital market that would
make it easier for money to cross European borders. “We still have quite some
work to do in Europe.”
Alfred Kammer, the director of the I.M.F.’s European department, warned against
“over-interpreting” the recent shift toward the euro. A “move to European
exceptionalism,” he said, is “still a long and hard road away.”
The region, he said, needed many more structural changes that would enable a
more dynamic business sector in which companies could reach larger markets and
pools of capital.
Many officials said it was more likely that the euro would be one of several assets
that become more prominent as investors reduce their holdings in dollars. In
recent weeks, for example, the price of gold has soared, exceeding $3,300 per troy
ounce, and the Swiss franc has also surged, gaining nearly 7 percent against the
dollar this month.
“I don’t see everyone massively getting out of dollars and suddenly shifting to the
euro; I think it’s more a healthy diversification,” Ms. Forbes said. But private
investors abroad who have built up a lot of holdings in U.S. debt and are now
watching the dollar decline want alternatives.
“Europe,” she added, “is a natural place to diversify.”

Julie Creswell;Danielle Kaye,NYT,1,Business,4/24/2025,Pepsico Cuts Growth Forecast Amid Tariffs and Slowed Consumer Spending,"Consumers, worried about the economy, are pulling back on their spending, and
that anxiety is translating into lower sales and profits for some of the country’s
largest consumer-oriented companies.
On Thursday, PepsiCo cut its full-year guidance outlook, citing a reduction in
consumer spending as well as the impact the company is feeling from increased
global tariffs.
“Relative to where we were three months ago, we probably aren’t feeling as good
about the consumer now,” Jamie Caulfield, the chief financial officer of PepsiCo,
told Wall Street analysts and investors on an earnings call Thursday morning.
The company, which manufactures Pepsi and Gatorade drinks as well as popular
snacks like Doritos and Cheetos, cut its profit forecast for the full year to flat from
its earlier guidance that expected earnings growth to be in the mid-single digits. It

reported a decline of 1.8 percent in revenue, to $17.9 billion, for the quarter that
ended March 22, and a drop of 10 percent in net income, to $1.8 billion, from a year
earlier.
PepsiCo’s stock fell more than 4 percent, to $136, by early afternoon.
Comments made on PepsiCo’s earnings call echoed what executives at other
consumer companies have said in recent days about how apprehension in the
global economy is key to less consumer spending. The pullback has started to
weigh on some companies’ revenues and dampen their outlook for the coming
months, especially as they try to calculate the costs they’ll incur from the Trump
administration’s new or increased tariffs on imported goods.

At Chipotle, same-store sales fell for the first time since 2020 in the most recent
quarter, the chain reported this week. Uncertainty about the path forward for the
U.S. economy started to affect spending in February, the company said, shortly
after President Trump’s inauguration — a trend that continued into April.

“It was all around this idea of saving money, economic uncertainty — they’re
eating at home more frequently than they’re eating out,” Scott Boatwright, the
burrito chain’s chief executive, said when asked about consumer behavior. The
underlying trend, he added, is “really tied to the consumer sitting on the sideline.”
Chipotle also lowered its full-year guidance. Beyond sluggish consumer spending,
the chain said it expected Mr. Trump’s tariffs imposed in April — a broad 10 percent
duty on many imports and tariffs on aluminum — to raise the company’s food,
beverage and packaging costs this year.
Another signal of distress among shoppers: Consumers are doing less laundry to
scale back on detergent purchases, an executive from Procter & Gamble, which
makes household staples like Tide detergent, told Yahoo Finance.
On Thursday, P.&G. cut its full-year outlook and said whiplash on tariff policy had
factored into a “pause” in consumption as consumers also tried to make sense of
stock market volatility and job market uncertainty, said Andre Schulten, the
company’s chief financial officer.
Signs that economic concerns are starting to affect consumer spending are
appearing in the airline industry, too. American Airlines pulled its full-year
guidance on Thursday, mirroring a move last month from Delta Air Lines. Robert
Isom, the chief executive of American Airlines, told CNBC on Thursday that
domestic leisure travel “fell off considerably” starting in February.
The most recent survey from the Conference Board showed consumer confidence
tumbling in March to its lowest level since January 2021. Americans are
increasingly anxious about their jobs and finances, the business group reported.
Hoping to entice consumers who are tightening wallets, executives at PepsiCo said
it was offering less expensive, under $2, individual bags of snacks along with
smaller snack packs in stores.
PepsiCo said it had calculated into its lower profit estimates the higher costs
associated with the tariffs. “We also factored in some of our mitigation plans, some
we will be able to execute more quickly than others,” Mr. Caulfield said on the call
on Thursday.
Analysts had been keeping a close eye on the impact that tariffs would have on the
food and beverage industry, specifically a 25 percent tariff on imported aluminum.
And while Wall Street analysts have been watching for potential fallout of the
Trump administration’s trade wars on sales of American brands in key
international markets, specifically Europe and China, PepsiCo said its global
markets performed well in the first quarter.
In the United States, the popularity of using Ozempic and other weight-loss drugs
has curbed sales for snacks and shifted purchases to smaller portions, Ramon
Laguarta, the chief executive of PepsiCo, told analysts.
PepsiCo is also navigating demands by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
This week, Mr. Kennedy declared that “sugar is poison” during a news conference
and said he had “an understanding” with major food manufacturers to remove
petroleum-based food colorings from their products by the end of 2026.
Mr. Laguarta said that PepsiCo had been an industry leader in reducing sodium
and sugar in products and that more than 60 percent of its business was from
products with no artificial colors. In the next few years, he added, the company will
have “migrated all the portfolio into natural colors or at least provide the consumer
with natural color options.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/business/pepsico-earnings-economy-tariffs.html
Clay Risen,NYT,1,Business,4/25/2025,Whiskey Fraud Strikes Britain and Ireland,"There are some 48,000 barrels of Scotch whisky quietly aging in Martin
Armstrong’s warehouses in southwestern Scotland. Last year, 17 of them became a
problem.
Mr. Armstrong normally deals with companies that buy hundreds of barrels at a
time from distilleries, then pay him to store them as they age. In July, he started
getting desperate calls from people who had bought just one or two barrels from an
investment outfit called Cask Whisky Limited. They had been told that some of
those barrels were stored in Mr. Armstrong’s warehouse.
Cask Whisky had promised those investors sky-high returns. But when the
company collapsed last year, it left them scrambling to find their barrels.
“We were inundated by questions,” Mr. Armstrong said.
He couldn’t help most of them. He had never even done business with Cask
Whisky. Still, Mr. Armstrong knew exactly what he was dealing with: yet another
in a growing number of Scotch whisky-investment scams.
A New, Full-Bodied Fraud
Comes in a Whisky Barrel
Barrel-investment scams have taken off in recent years, Mr. Armstrong said, because
the rapid rise in the price of luxury whisky makes investors willing to overlook red

There are dozens of companies like Cask Whisky, often located in London but
selling barrels stored in remote corners of Scotland and Ireland, making it hard for
clients to see their investments in person. Some are semi-legitimate operations
that sell barrels at prices so inflated they will take decades to turn a profit; others
are practicing outright fraud.
“There’s a whole range of different types of cask scams, from the mild to the just
evil,” said Isabel Graham-Yooll, a whisky consultant in London. “It’s a murky old
world.”
The City of London Police said it received 89 reports of alcohol investment fraud in
2023, the most recent data available, amounting to nearly $4 million in lost money.
Those numbers are set to grow, experts warn, as the global economy teeters and
people become more aware of the risks involved in barrel investing and try to get
out. Many are about to realize that what they took to be a sound investment is
anything but.
“I personally think that we’re at the beginning of what’s going to be a major
industry crisis,” said Felipe Schrieberg, a journalist and a founder of the consumer-
awareness website Protect Your Cask. “Bloodbath has been the word that I’ve been
using.”
As a rule, whisky barrels gain in value the longer they age: The taste of the liquid
improves, while slow evaporation means there is less of it each year. As a result,
barrels have long been a favored commodity among fraudsters, who promise big
returns to unsuspecting investors. But for several reasons, the scams have picked
up in earnest over the last five years.
Whisky gains much of its value through aging, and in Scotland that can mean waiting

For one thing, near-zero interest rates pushed investors to seek out better returns
than banks could offer. Government-issued stimulus checks during the Covid
pandemic gave British taxpayers money to play with. And sophisticated marketing
tools allowed companies to pinpoint promising demographics — often retirees with
a nest egg and a poor grasp of the risks involved.
All this happened at a time when the valuations for top-rated single-malt Scotch
were skyrocketing. In a 2023 report on so-called passion assets by the Knight
Frank Luxury Investment Index, rare whisky grew 428 percent in value over the
previous 10 years, far more than products like wine and watches.
Investment companies took such numbers and blasted them across Facebook and
Google Ads, reeling in thousands of hapless clients.
“The biggest problem is that people are so desperate to make an investment that
the fear of missing out means that they bypass all logical safety checks,” Mr.
Armstrong said.
To insiders like Mr. Armstrong, the red flags are obvious. A new barrel of whisky
should cost less than $1,000 before a reasonable markup, but these companies often
sell them for as much as six times that amount.
They tout access to highly regarded distilleries like Linkwood and Deanston,
without explaining that the barrels frequently come with trademark protections
that forbid using the distilleries’ names, which significantly reduces their value.
And the investment companies often issue ownership documents that leave out key
details, like the date of distillation, making it hard for buyers to track down their
barrels among the estimated 22 million stored around Scotland.
“I think part of it is that romance of whisky, the romance of having your own cask
in a warehouse, that makes people let their guards down,” said Mr. Schrieberg, the
journalist.
Very few barrels achieve the characteristics required to fetch high prices, a fact that barrel-investment

Even the promise of steady, elevated returns is largely a myth. Value growth in
whisky is not linear; a four-year-old barrel is not worth much more than a three-
year-old one, and barrels reach premium status only at around 18 years old.
And only a vanishingly small number of barrels produce whisky with the right
aroma and taste to fetch the sort of five-figure prices that investment companies
often promise. There is simply no way of knowing whether a particular barrel, on
the day it is filled, will ever reach that height.
“It’s like saying this specific blue paint was used by Picasso, this particular Picasso
painting made with that blue paint went up 1,000 percent, ergo, if you buy this tub
of blue paint, it is going to go up that same percent,” said Blair Bowman, a whisky
broker who has been critical of the barrel-investment business.
Making the hard sell for bad investments isn’t necessarily illegal. But several
companies are clearly committing fraud.
Mr. Armstrong requires barrel owners to tell him when they sell to third parties,
but neither the original owners, nor Cask Whisky, informed him about their sales.
As he tried to piece together what had happened, he realized that the company had
likely sold the same barrels to multiple people, or sold barrels that didn’t exist in
the first place.
In March, the BBC produced an exposé about the barrel-investment industry,
including interviews with investors who had put hundreds of thousands of pounds
into schemes that turned sour. The BBC also reported that the London police were
investigating Cask Whisky Limited and two similar operations, Cask Spirits Global
Limited and Whisky Scotland, for fraud.
But enforcement is rare. In Britain, the financial authorities don’t regulate barrels
as investments, offering little protection for buyers. And the line between high-
pressure salesmanship and fraud is a blurry one, though in some cases the
country’s Advertising Standards Authority has gone after companies for
misleading marketing.
Investors have slim chances of recovering their money. In March, Britain’s
Insolvency Office, the government agency that is shutting down Cask Whisky, sent
out a memo telling investors that it couldn’t help them recover their barrels; all it
could offer was a list of email addresses for warehouses where those barrels might
sit.
Isabel Graham-Yooll, a whisky industry consultant, said Britain lacks strong
protections against barrel-investment scams. “We’re just all waiting for someone to

“There’s this kind of superhero complex, where we’re just all waiting for someone
to come in and fix things,” Ms. Graham-Yooll said.
The problem is largely specific to Scotland and Ireland, where the buying and
selling of barrels among businesses is a longstanding practice. It is less of an issue
in the United States, where it’s harder for individual buyers to purchase barrels
and where the Securities and Exchange Commission often regulates the sale of
barrels as investments.
To be fair, some barrel-investment companies are legitimate, and may even offer a
realistic way to turn a long-term profit. But the industry is so complex and scams
so plentiful that experts advise staying away.
“In theory, there is a world in which buying casks by the general public could
work,” Mr. Schrieberg said. “But if you’re a Joe Public, I’d recommend don’t get
involved. It’s just too high-risk and there’s too much ugly stuff going on.”

Stocks rose on Thursday, marking a third consecutive daily rally as investors hope
for an easing of President Trump’s trade wars and weigh comments from a Federal
Reserve official on tariffs’ economic impacts.
The S&P 500 gained 2 percent after stalling in early trading. The index has
seesawed this week: Monday saw a sharp sell-off, followed by three days of sizable
gains after President Trump on Tuesday said that he was prepared to be “very
nice” in trade negotiations with China.
The rally then paused after officials in China said they were not holding talks with
the United States about easing trade tensions. But indexes continued to swing on
scraps of information about tariffs and monetary policy, in the absence of concrete
developments about the escalating global trade war.
On Thursday, Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, told Bloomberg that the
economic hit from Mr. Trump’s tariffs would take time to show up in the data,
suggesting that the central bank was not poised to lower interest rates soon. But
when asked what would prompt him to favor a rate cut, Mr. Waller said: “If I saw
enough movement in the unemployment rate to make me think that things were
going bad, or growth prospects started tanking, or consumer spending started
really going down, then I’d be ready to go.”
He Yadong, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Commerce, said on Thursday that
“there are currently no economic and trade negotiations between China and the
United States, and any claims about progress in China-U.S. economic and trade
negotiations are baseless rumors without factual evidence.”
A spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Guo Jiakun, reiterated China’s
stance, which is that the tariff war was started by the United States and that China
would only engage in talks under certain conditions. “China’s attitude is consistent

and clear: If you want to fight, we will fight to the end; if you want to talk, the door
is open,” he said.
The day before, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed speculation that Mr.
Trump was considering unilaterally lowering tariffs on China and emphasized that
any moves to de-escalate trade tensions would need to be mutual. “I don’t think
either side believes that the current tariff levels are sustainable,” he said.
In other developments on Thursday:
Big companies reporting their latest earnings warned that tariffs and economic
uncertainty would dent profits in the months ahead. PepsiCo and Merck cut their
earnings forecasts, while American Airlines withdrew its previous forecast for the
rest of the year, until “the economic outlook becomes clearer.”
A rise in major technology stocks boosted the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite
index, which gained 2.7 percent for the day. Shares in Amazon were up more than
3 percent, as were shares in the chip giant Nvidia.
The U.S. dollar fell against several major currencies, including the euro, the
British pound and the Japanese yen.
The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, which move inversely to prices, fell to 4.31
percent.
Oil futures recovered some ground, with Brent crude up about 0.4 percent, to
more than $66 a barrel.

Adeel Hassan,NYT,1,Business,4/26/2025,Ex-Disney Worker Who Hacked Menus Gets 3 Years in Prison,"A former employee of Walt Disney World who hacked into menus used by its
restaurants and edited them — changing prices, adding profanity and altering
listed allergens — was sentenced to three years in prison by a federal judge in
Florida this week.
None of the changes, including falsified information about food allergens that could
have been harmful to visitors, ever appeared before the public, according to court
records. The menu alterations were caught and court records show that none of the
changes ever reached the printing stage.
The former employee, Michael Scheuer of Winter Garden, Fla., was sentenced on
Wednesday in federal court in Orlando, Fla., after pleading guilty in January to one
count of computer fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft.
Mr. Scheuer, 40, was ordered to pay restitution of about $620,000 to Disney and
$70,000 to the unidentified software company that provides Disney with its menu
creation program.
While court documents do not mention Disney World, menus that were entered
into evidence in Mr. Scheuer’s case are from the hundreds of restaurants at Walt
Disney World in Orlando.
Disney World representatives did not respond to messages seeking comment.
In early June 2024, Mr. Scheuer had returned from paternity leave, court
documents show. A few days later, he had an argument with a supervisor about
menu creation, according to the documents, and he was told that he would be
suspended.
Instead, he was fired for unspecified misconduct, the documents state.
An investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation later revealed that,
beginning around that time and over approximately the next three months, there
were multiple hacks into servers that hosted the menu creation program.
Those changes included price cuts or hikes of a few dollars, profanities and altering
allergens in certain items.
On a drink called the “Giddy-Up” — a blend of vodka, lemonade and iced tea — he
lowered the price by $2, according to court records, and took two ounces off a 10-
ounce filet mignon. In another instance, “shellfish” was changed to “hellfish.”
On a couple of menus, either the prices or the descriptions of the items
disappeared.
He changed a wine region — Golden, Colo. — to the location of a mass shooting,
Aurora, Colo. He also edited “Infamous Goose” — high-quality imported wine from
New Zealand — to “Infamous Moose.”
More crucially, Mr. Scheuer edited certain menu items, falsely showing that they
were safe for people with allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish and milk,
according to his plea agreement.
Prosecutors said “the discreet way in which these changes were made was likely
by design, specifically to avoid detection.”
But Mr. Scheuer’s lawyer, David Haas, said that his client had only been trying to
get the attention of Disney so that it would respond to him.
“He knew the menu changes would be identified in Disney’s extensive menu
review process,” Mr. Haas said in a court document.
Disney had indeed noticed, and it had contacted the F.B.I., identifying Mr. Scheuer
as a possible suspect. In September, the F.B.I. executed a search warrant at Mr.
Scheuer’s home and seized several electronic devices.
The criminal complaint also shows that Mr. Scheuer blocked 14 Disney employees
from their company accounts through denial-of-service attacks. Some of the
targeted workers were former colleagues involved in his firing, according to court
records.
On one occasion, Mr. Scheuer drove to the home of one of the targeted employees
shortly before 11 p.m., walked to the front door and gave a thumbs-up to the Ring
doorbell camera before leaving, court records show.
Gregory W. Kehoe, the interim U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Florida, said
that Mr. Scheuer’s actions were at least partly attributable to a mental health
episode. Prosecutors asked for a 70-month sentence.
Mr. Haas said in an interview on Friday that “Mr. Scheuer remains remorseful and
apologetic to his former co-workers,” adding that he was grateful to the judge for
imposing only a 36-month sentence.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/26/us/disney-worker-prison-

Updated April 28, 2025
There was a line of hundreds of people in front of the Pop Mart store in Los Angeles
at 4:45 a.m. on Friday.
Korin Reese arrived thinking she was somewhat early and was stunned to find
customers already waiting. Some brought stools and foldable chairs to sit on, while
others came with bags full of snacks and drinks. Ms. Reese heard that some of the
people in line had been there since 10 p.m. the day before.
They, like Ms. Reese, wanted to get their hands on the latest series of a new key-
ring doll called the Labubu, which is sold exclusively at Pop Mart, a Chinese
collectibles retailer. The dolls, which belong to a tribe called The Monsters, are the
latest in a long line of iconic collectible characters from Asia, including Hello Kitty
— now a 50-year-old matriarch — Sonny Angel and Gudetama.
Labubu dolls are fuzzy little Nordic elves with snaggletoothed, mischievous grins
and impish ears. They’re all female, they’re kindhearted, but sometimes, as they go
about spreading joy, they get into trouble. “Well-intentioned” trouble, though, said
Emily Brough, head of licensing at Pop Mart North America. “It’s never malicious.”
How These Little Elves Turned Into a
Global Sensation
The creatures, conceptualized in 2015 by an artist born in Hong Kong, Kasing Lung,
began as characters in a children’s book series. In 2019, Mr. Lung signed a
partnership with Pop Mart to turn the storybook elves into collectible designer
toys, starting with a line of figurines. Pop Mart’s first Labubu key-ring series,
called the Exciting Macaron, was released in October 2023.
Each time a new Labubu has been released, it has sold out within minutes online.
(Each doll costs roughly $30, but some limited-edition items can cost more.) They
have spawned communities — in real life and online, where fans discuss tips on
how to score dolls or dress them up and share images of their collections — and
have turned into unexpected fashion accessories, often juxtaposed against luxury
handbags.
Labubu dolls, like this one from the Let’s Checkmate
collection, typically sell out within minutes of being
released online. Pop Mart
The success of Pop Mart, the Chinese company behind the brand, has been
somewhat recession-proof, according to Bloomberg, with its stock and profits
rallying despite global economic uncertainty and trade war concerns. The
company reported $1.8 billion in revenue in 2024 — a more than 100 percent
increase from the previous year. The Labubu dolls and The Monsters tribe
contributed about $400 million in revenue last year — a growth of 726 percent from
the previous year — making it among the company’s top-selling products.
It was last year when the popularity of the dolls really took off, crossing over from
the world of niche hobby collecting into the mainstream. Last spring, Lisa, a
member of the pop group Blackpink and one of the stars of “White Lotus,” posted a
picture of her Labubu dangling off a Louis Vuitton bag on her Instagram story. And
in the fall, she opened up about her obsession with Pop Mart and the dolls in an
interview with Vanity Fair. “I spent all my money” at these stores, she told the
magazine.
Then in February, the pop star and fashion icon Rihanna was spotted with a
Labubu, also clipped onto her Louis Vuitton bag; the singer Dua Lipa was seen
with one, too. This week, the actress Emma Roberts posted an Instagram story of
her latest haul of four Labubu dolls, set to the Britney Spears song “Oops! ... I Did
It Again.” In March, Pop Mart opened a pop-up store at the British luxury
department store Harrods, leading to lines of fans snaking around Knightsbridge,
eager to get the doll.
One of the ways Pop Mart has built interest in the dolls is by releasing some of
them in a “blind box” so that buyers don’t know which doll is hidden inside. That
distribution strategy is what “keeps fans interested” and constantly on their toes,
said Joshua Paul Dale, the author of “Irresistible: How Cuteness Wired Our Brains
and Conquered the World.”
In December, it was that mysterious hype that got Martin Andre Navarro
Nibungco, a 22-year-old musician, stopped at an airport. He was returning from a
vacation in Bangkok to his home in Los Angeles with 12 Labubu dolls in his
suitcase to gift to his friends. He had to transfer to a domestic flight at the San
Francisco airport and, while going through airport security, six Transportation
Security Administration agents descended on his suitcase and took him aside.
“Everyone was like, ‘Oh, my god, we need to know what you guys got? What do
you think you guys got?’” Mr. Navarro Nibungco said in a phone interview. He
opened his suitcase, and “one of the agents took one of the boxes through the X-
ray,” he said.
When Mr. Navarro Nibungco carries his Labubu around (he clips it to his belt
loop), he has found that it often serves as a fun conversation starter with strangers.
“The association with the Labubus is only comfort,” and it opens the door to a
harmless, politics-free chat, he said. It’s “escapism.”

“People are patiently waiting and are willing to pay 20-something bucks despite
whatever is going on with the world right now,” he said. “That says something.”
In response to the Labubu craze, entire mini industries have sprung up on sites like
Etsy and AliExpress, where creators sell tiny outfits specifically designed for the
dolls, car seats for them to sit in and even little handbags for them to carry.
At 10 p.m. Eastern on Thursday, the day before the new Labubu line was to release
in U.S. stores, the dolls were supposed to drop online. But the Pop Mart website
and app crashed because they were inundated with more traffic than the company
had prepared for, Pop Mart said in an email. On Reddit, users shared that they
were panicking and fervently refreshing the website.
When the site and app were back up, the dolls had already sold out.
“So I was like, you know what? I’m just going to go down and actually try to
physically pick these up,” Ms. Reese, 42, a financial planner in retail, said in a
phone interview. “I expected there to be a line but I didn’t think it was going to be
that serious,” she said, adding that it was “literally the Hunger Games.” There were
long lines at other Pop Mart locations as well.
At one point, the crowd in Los Angeles was growing restless, Ms. Reese said, with
people pushing one another to reach the front. Amid the chaos, a woman in front of
her fell to the floor. In the end, Ms. Reese left empty-handed. It didn’t matter — she
already had six dolls at home.
Online, too, many Labubu enthusiasts — who speculated that bots buying up the
inventory to resell it were responsible for crashing the website — felt defeated
when they couldn’t score a doll. “DID WE WASTE AT LEAST AN HOUR OF OUR
TIME WAITING FOR THE ADORABLE STUPID LITTLE COLLECTABLE
DOLLS,” one user wrote in a post. “Yes.”
“Twas a hard battle,” the user wrote, “but we must play the waiting game now.”

Every Monday, Maurine Gentis, a retired teacher, waits for a delivery from Meals
on Wheels South Texas.
“The meals help stretch my budget,” Ms. Gentis, 77, said. Living alone and in a
wheelchair, she appreciates having someone look in on her regularly. The same
group, a nonprofit, delivers books from the library and dry food for her cat.
But Ms. Gentis is anxious about what lies ahead. The small government agency
responsible for overseeing programs like Meals on Wheels is being dismantled as
part of the Trump administration’s overhaul of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services. Roughly half its staff has been let go in recent layoffs and all of its
10 regional offices are closed, according to several employees who lost their jobs.
“I’m just kind of worried that the whole thing might go down the drain, too,” Ms.
Gentis said.
In President Trump’s quest to end what he termed “illegal and immoral
discrimination programs,” one of his executive orders promoted cracking down on
federal efforts to improve accessibility and representation for those with
disabilities, with agencies flagging words like “accessible” and “disability” as
potentially problematic. Certain research studies are no longer being funded, and
many government health employees specializing in disability issues have been
fired.
The downsizing of the agency, the Administration for Community Living, is part of
far-reaching cuts planned at the H.H.S. under the Trump administration’s proposed
budget.
While some federal funding may continue through September, the end of the
government’s fiscal year, and some workers have been called back temporarily,
there is significant uncertainty about the future. And some groups are reporting
delays in receiving expected federal funds.
Maurine Gentis of Victoria, Texas, who receives Meals on Wheels deliveries. “I’m just
kind of worried that the whole thing might go down the drain, too,” Ms. Gentis said.

“There’s a lot of confusion,” said Becky Yanni, the executive director of the Council
on Aging in St. Johns County in Florida. She said she has been told that the most
recent funding for its Meals on Wheels program and other services might be late.
If the funding does not arrive, “in a lot of communities, you will be looking at cuts in
services,” said Sandy Markwood, the chief executive officer for USAging, which
represents the network of area agencies of aging.
The community living division helps coordinate services and provide funding for
older and disabled Americans so they can stay at home rather than live in a
nursing home. With a budget of $2.6 billion, the unit represents a minuscule
fraction of total H.H.S. spending.
Under the reorganization introduced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,
the community unit’s responsibilities will be divided among other agencies,
including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Administration
for Children and Families.
“This consolidation allows the department to better meet the current health needs
of vulnerable populations across the country,” a spokeswoman for H.H.S. said in a
statement. “This does not impact the important work of these critical programs as
it will continue elsewhere within H.H.S.”
So far, several programs under the unit will be eliminated under the proposed
budget, including one that provides ombudsmen in nursing homes, to help ensure
the safety and welfare of residents, and respite care programs, to provide a break
for those caring for an older person or person with disabilities. States would also
have more latitude in determining where funds should be allocated.
In addition to meal deliveries, the community living agency supports numerous
programs, including the nonprofit Centers for Independent Living, that are staffed
by people with disabilities, who help older adults and others with disabilities move
out of nursing homes and back into the community, and find services, like
transportation and legal assistance.
Theo W. Braddy, the executive director for the National Council on Independent
Living, which represents the centers and people with disabilities, said the
uncertainty has upended planning.
“Everybody is on edge. We can’t tell them anything because we don’t know
anything yet,” he said, adding that no one from the Trump administration or H.H.S.
has attempted to contact the group with updates.

Advocates say the recent cutbacks have further marginalized older Americans and
those with disabilities. “The bottom line is that people in charge simply don’t care
about large swaths of the American people,” said Dr. Joanne Lynne, a clinical
professor of geriatrics and palliative care at George Washington University.
“We have made living with disability and old age exceedingly unpleasant,” she
said. “We are on course to make it virtually intolerable.”
Community groups like Meals on Wheels are bracing for significant cuts. In
addition to the potential loss of funding from the Administration for Community
Living, Republican lawmakers are proposing reducing grants to states that use
another stream of federal funding. The Trump administration and Republicans are
also pushing for significant cuts to the Medicaid program, which provides heath
care coverage for low-income Americans.
“We’re concerned about a number of potential threats happening all at once,” said
Josh Protas, the chief advocacy and policy officer for Meals on Wheels America, an
association of the local nonprofits. About a third of the association’s local units
already have waiting lists, he said, and lower funding would result in fewer meals
for fewer people.

People who are 60 or older with low incomes, and who have difficulty preparing
food for themselves, typically qualify for Meals on Wheels. The demand for
services is increasing as food prices rise and more people need assistance. More
than two million older Americans receive food deliveries each year, and many say
they would have difficulty paying for meals without the program.
“Meals on Wheels is a godsend for me,” said Richard Beatty, a 70-year-old with
poor vision and limited mobility living in Baltimore. He receives deliveries four
times a week and isn’t sure how he would manage without the program.
If there are cuts in funding, the programs would have to make hard choices about
who would be eligible for deliveries. “We would have to make drastic changes to
who we were serving,” said Dan Capone, the chief executive of Meals on Wheels
South Texas, which serves roughly 300 people a week, including Ms. Gentis. His
group also receives private donations, with federal funds accounting for some 40
percent of the budget, he said.
The federal community unit under the ax also plays a key role in supporting
disabled Americans, including older individuals.
“So much of the work we do is about giving people dignity in their lives,” said
Karen Tamley, the chief executive of Access Living, a Chicago-based center, one of
400 across the United States.
The centers connect people with a variety of services, and offer job and skills
training to young adults with disabilities. They may teach someone to drive, or help
them find affordable housing.
The Administration for Community Living has helped organizations navigate the
state and local bureaucracies responsible for doling out federal funds. When Mr.
Capone wanted more clarity as to how Texas was distributing the money, he got in
touch with the unit’s regional office in Dallas. “We just started building that
relationship with the field office, and that field office is gone,” he said.
“It is frustrating on a practical level,” said Fay Gordon, one of the regional
administrators who was let go earlier this month. “These programs are live and
need direction.”

Some groups are not waiting before starting to take steps to reduce costs. Brittany
Boyd-Chisholm, the chief executive of the Center for Independent Living of Central
Pennsylvania, said that more than half of her funding comes through the federal
agency. She has asked all the managers, herself included, to take a cut in salary of
between 5 and 10 percent and is weighing other actions. She said her center was
already underfunded.
No one has provided her with any information about future grants, and her emails
have not been returned. “It makes you feel completely on your own,” Ms. Boyd-
Chisholm said.
Created under the Obama administration, the agency was intended to unify the
work of three other agencies: the Administration on Aging, the Office on Disability
and the Administration on Developmental Disabilities.
“These programs being together and working together was about efficiency and
was about coordination,” said Alison Barkoff, the former acting administrator
under President Biden, who stepped down last fall.
During the first Trump administration, at the height of the pandemic, the agency
worked with the department’s Office for Civil Rights to ensure hospitals and
doctors had clear guidelines so that if staffing fell short they wouldn’t deny care to
those with disabilities.
“We had found common ground and issues to work on together,” said Daniel Davis,
who worked for the agency’s Center of Policy and Evaluation, whose entire staff
was laid off, according to former employees.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/health/meals-on-wheels-disabilities-aging-trump-cutbacks.html
Sapna Maheshwari,NYT,1,Business,4/27/2025,Inside The Mad Dash to Turn Division I Athletes Into Influencers,"A new effort at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is aimed at turning
its student-athletes into well-remunerated social media stars. Other schools are
following suit.

Sapna Maheshwari, a U.N.C. alumna, interviewed more than a dozen student-athletes and coaches in Chapel Hill,
N.C., for this article.
Published April 27, 2025
Updated April 28, 2025
On a February afternoon at the University of North Carolina, a group of seven
students on the diving team sat barefoot on the floor of the college’s muggy
natatorium. They were staring expectantly at a petite blond woman in a black
sweater perched on a concrete block.
Vickie Segar was there, with the blessing of the university’s athletic department, to
pitch them on turning their TikTok and Instagram accounts into cash cows.
“Let’s talk about the money in the creator economy,” said Ms. Segar, after
explaining that she was a graduate of the university who had run a top influencer
marketing agency for a dozen years. “Does anybody follow Alix Earle?”
The students said yes, amid several chuckles, because asking a college student
that question in 2025 is like asking if a millennial has ever heard of Beyoncé.
How much money, she continued, did they think that Ms. Earle, a TikTok megastar
who rose to fame with confessional-style videos about beauty and college life,
makes for promoting a brand across several posts on Instagram Stories?
“$100,000?” one student guessed. “$70,000,” another tossed out.
They’re on the Varsity
Influencer Team
Ms. Segar, whose firm has worked with Ms. Earle on brand deals, paused. She
drew out her response: “$450,000 per Instagram Story.”
For a moment, there was just the hum of the pool and a single exclamation from
one student: “Oh. My. God.”
Ms. Segar smiled and explained, “Our job is to help you guys bring in some of that
money.”
Benjamin Gildin and Vickie Segar, who run Article 41.
U.N.C. doesn’t have a formal contract with Ms. Segar or her firm, Article 41. But the
school has encouraged students and coaches to work with them. Later this year,
the firm’s pitch will also be a part of orientation for freshman athletes at the school.
Welcome to the budding business of turning college athletes into social media
stars. The world of intercollegiate sports has been upended in recent years by the
National Collegiate Athletic Association’s rules that allow student-athletes to make
money from their name, image and likeness — known as N.I.L. For the most part, it
was viewed as a change that would reward stars in college basketball and football.
Now, Chapel Hill is at the forefront of the next stage of the N.I.L. era. The school is
supporting Ms. Segar in her effort, which began last fall, to turn all 850 of its
student-athletes into influencers.
The school doesn’t get a cut of their earnings. But “they want every athlete at the
school to make as much money as possible because it will get better athletes,” Ms.
Segar said.
This hoped-for, large-scale conversion of college athletes to influencers shows how
N.I.L. deals “have grown exponentially in ways that nobody could have imagined
or predicted,” said Michael H. LeRoy, a law professor at the University of Illinois.
“This is another milestone in how this is evolving.”
And while many students are eager to make some extra cash, the efforts are
alarming to some. “This saddens me,” Mr. LeRoy said. “Their bodies are being
monetized on TikTok for the benefit of the school.”
A Gold Rush
The new N.I.L. rules have already minted a few unexpected stars in the last few
years. There’s Olivia Dunne, the 22-year-old Louisiana State gymnast, who can
now command hundreds of thousands of dollars for an advertorial TikTok post. And
Haley and Hanna Cavinder, 24-year-old twins, who made N.I.L. deals valued at
more than $1.5 million, according to Forbes, while playing basketball at the
University of Miami.
Ms. Segar, 42, who graduated from North Carolina in 2005 and lives in Chapel Hill,
believes those players are just the start. Uber, Athleta and State Farm are among
companies that have already paid for posts that feature student-athletes showing
off their game-day looks or routines. Only a few students will hit big numbers, but
Ms. Segar reasons that many could eventually make at least a few thousand dollars
per branded TikTok or Instagram post.
Article 41, which Ms. Segar founded in 2024 with her husband, Ben Gildin, a lawyer
and former lacrosse player at Kenyon College, will take a 20 percent cut of the
deals, which is typical among influencer management firms.
Skyler Smith, a U.N.C. swimmer, recording a video for her social media, sponsored by Uber Eats.
Other companies, including traditional Hollywood agencies and boutique firms,
have been pouncing on N.I.L. influencer opportunities, too. Those efforts have
largely been focused on top talent in basketball and football who might one day
play professionally. Creative Artists Agency, one of Hollywood’s powerhouse firms,
says it has worked with nearly 100 athletes on N.I.L. deals since 2021.
ESM, a sports management firm that historically worked with N.F.L. players, now
represents a roster of current and former student-athletes, including the Cavinder
twins, and is helping Clemson start an in-house agency.
But Ms. Segar’s firm is unique, so far, in its belief that every athlete —
benchwarmer or not — can have a following.
‘The Lion’s Share of the Money’
Bella Miller, who competes in gymnastics for the school, has struck a paid deal with Athleta.
Bubba Cunningham, the U.N.C. athletic director, works out of an office next door to
the Dean E. Smith Center, where its famed men’s basketball team plays. From
there, he oversees 28 varsity teams, many of them elite, like women’s soccer and
field hockey.
Mr. Cunningham, whose given name is Lawrence, has been the college’s athletic
director for more than a decade, which means he has watched the full-scale erosion
of the long-held bargain between athletes and their universities: a free education in
exchange for their on-field prowess. That meant, officially at least, no
advertisements, gifts or cuts of merchandise sold by schools, even jerseys with
their name on the back.
That model has all but imploded in recent years amid a series of antitrust cases.
Based on the preliminary terms of a landmark settlement, schools like U.N.C. will
offer student-athletes two potential forms of compensation beyond scholarships in
the 2025-26 school year. The school is likely to have $20.5 million — calculated by
taking 22 percent of the most recent annual revenue from four major college sports
divisions generated from media and sponsorship rights and ticket sales — to pay
athletes directly, through a revenue-sharing agreement. The settlement would
resolve several antitrust lawsuits filed against the N.C.A.A. and the biggest
conferences by former college athletes.
At U.N.C., that $20.5 million will go to men’s and women’s basketball, football and
baseball, according to Mr. Cunningham. Many other schools are doing similar
splits.
“Since this is about the commercial value of the sport, we’re going to attribute the
money to the sport that earned it,” he said.
Making an arrangement with a firm like Ms. Segar’s offers him a solution for
everyone else — especially female athletes.
“The most popular player on the most popular team is what I’ve always said will
get the lion’s share of the money,” Mr. Cunningham said. “But the most
entrepreneurial student that understands social media and understands how to
create a social media presence can become an influencer.”
Ms. Miller, who has more than 27,000 followers on TikTok, said that she wasn’t sure sports like hers
would ever benefit from N.I.L.
Bella Miller, a 22-year-old gymnast at U.N.C. with more than 27,000 followers on
TikTok, said she wasn’t sure sports like hers would ever benefit from N.I.L., with so
few athletes eventually competing professionally. Despite the success of someone
like Ms. Dunne, most brands and agents “don’t want to focus their time and energy
on sports like gymnastics, volleyball, swimming because they didn’t really see that
potential,” she added.
The ‘Cringe-y’ Hump
Article 41’s pitch about becoming an influencer — complete with a 50-page training
guide with tips like “no, you don’t have to dance” and “treat each TikTok as a bite-
sized lesson” — is aimed at members of a cohort who have, in some cases, been
using social media since before they were teenagers.
For many, the notion of becoming a creator is appealing. In a 2023 Morning Consult
survey, three in five members of Generation Z said they would become influencers
if given the opportunity. (And many of them might have the opportunity. There are
27 million paid creators in the United States, and 44 percent of them are doing it full
time, according to a 2023 survey from the Keller Advisory Group, a consultancy.)
Alyssa Ustby, a star player on the women’s basketball team, is among U.N.C.’s highest-paid student-
athletes when it comes to N.I.L. deals.
Alyssa Ustby, 23, a star player on the women’s basketball team, who is
bespectacled and earnest off the court, is among the highest-paid U.N.C. student-
athletes when it comes to N.I.L. deals.
She said she had around 1,000 Instagram followers before college: She’d post
photos of friends, or senior prom. But when she entered U.N.C. in 2020, TikTok was
ubiquitous.
“I was like, ‘OK, what’s the worst that could happen — that I stay where I am?’”
Ms. Ustby said. She quickly became a hit with a TikTok series that showed her
training with other U.N.C. athletes, poking fun at her form as she tried to do laps
with the swim team and trying to catch a ball with the women’s lacrosse team.
Now, she has 132,000 followers on TikTok and 54,000 on Instagram and commands
between $10,000 and $15,000 for branded posts. Sponsors have included Papa
John’s (“Where’s the best place to eat an epic stuffed crust pizza?” she asks, eating
one as a study snack and in the gym in a TikTok ad) and American Eagle Outfitters.
Ms. Ustby, who majored in advertising and public relations (and just signed a free-
agent contract with the W.N.B.A.’s Los Angeles Sparks), said she saw her
experience building a TikTok audience as akin to an internship. She earned more
than $100,000 through brand deals last year and tracked them on a spreadsheet
that is also monitored by her father, a wealth manager.
Jake Dailey, a wrestler, has no reservations about featuring his body prominently on his social media. He
has scored free products and a recent paid deal with an apparel company called the Mutt Dog.
Jake Dailey, a 19-year-old freshman wrestler from Scranton, Pa., with moppy hair
and a big smile, said that he was probably 10 years old when he started using social
media. He started posting silly jokes and wrestling videos to TikTok as a high
school freshman in 2021, which his mother encouraged, even though it earned
some derision from his peers.
“I would say, yeah, it’s cringe-y,” but “it’s definitely going to pay off in the long run
for me,” he said. Mr. Dailey said he had scored free products and a recent paid deal
with an apparel company called the Mutt Dog.
Many of Mr. Dailey’s posts depict him shirtless, pointing his phone camera at
himself in the mirror or flexing. In his view, physique is part of why student-
athletes play well on social media. “Young, fit, attractive people definitely come
from athletics,” he said.
Mr. Dailey, who has 90,000 TikTok followers and 32,000 on Instagram, said he
would be thrilled to become a full-time influencer. Otherwise, he plans to become a
dentist.
The Thirst Trap Strategy
Bodies are, inevitably, part of what’s on display. When Ms. Segar and Mr. Gildin
spoke to U.N.C.’s divers, they urged them to highlight their physical abilities. “I put
diving at the top with gymnastics” with tricks that regular people can’t do, Ms.
Segar told the group, using an expletive for emphasis. (She said she intentionally
peppers her talks with curse words to put the students at ease.)
Women are often the audience that brands are trying to reach on TikTok and
Instagram, and they’re more likely to post as creators on the platforms, Ms. Segar
said. The success of athletes like Ms. Dunne and the Cavinder twins sometimes
attracts a line of criticism about how much their looks matter.
Mr. Dailey, whose posts depict him shirtless, hopes to become a dentist if influencing eludes him as a
career.
Ms. Segar admitted that athlete-influencers in the very top tier are more likely to
be conventionally attractive, but pushed back on the idea that the student-athletes
she is pitching need to adopt what she called Mr. Dailey’s “thirst trap strategy.”
A breakout star probably has “something really special about them — they are
either a top athlete or they are really beautiful or they are incredibly funny,” she
said. “But we don’t need people to get eight million followers. We need them to get
to 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 followers — that is where we start seeing revenue.”
Ms. Segar acknowledged that race can play a role in determining which athletes
gain bigger social media followings, outside of sports like basketball and football.
But she said she believed that was changing with the younger generation. And, she
added, “there is more money going to diverse creators in the N.I.L. space than
there is in the traditional influencer space that I’ve worked in for over a decade.”
Mr. LeRoy, the Illinois law professor, said he was concerned about the mental
health ramifications as more athletes pushed to have big presences on social
media.
Ms. Ustby an advertising and public relations major, said she sees her experience building a TikTok
audience as akin to an internship.
Ms. Ustby, the basketball player, said a friend on the team who started building up
her TikTok presence at the same time as her didn’t enjoy the same success.
“She was constantly putting in all this effort, making videos, and they would just
never go viral,” she said. “She said it literally just felt like a popularity contest she
was losing, and it sucks, and that was a really strenuous thing on our friendship
because my stuff was kind of taking off.”
Mr. LeRoy said that it was worth remembering that “these are undergrads, many
of whom are teenagers.”
“If part of your N.I.L. strategy as a school is to increase your student-athlete
exposure to the social media ecosystem that is filled with irrationality and hate,
you’re not helping the mental health of the athletes,” Mr. LeRoy said. “This is not a
good atmosphere for them to be competing at a high level and then also competing
in the social media sphere.”
Mark Gangloff, U.N.C.’s head coach of swimming and diving, said he was keeping
an eye on how influencing fit into athletes’ “very full plates.”
“That is my only caution — how much is too many things for any one person to try
and take on at one time?” he said.
(Article 41 and U.N.C.’s coaches have emphasized that the effort is entirely
voluntary and that many student-athletes have opted to keep their social media
profiles private.)
Top of the Algorithm
Ryleigh Heck, a U.N.C. field hockey player, recording a video for Athleta. She has been watching TikTok
since it was known as Musical.ly pre-2018, and counts the Cavinder twins, the basketball players, among
her favorite influencers.
Ms. Segar and Mr. Gildin are self-funding Article 41, which has 13 full-time
employees and 24 paid interns. (She sold her influencer agency, Village Marketing,
to the ad giant WPP in 2022.) The couple are prepared to invest several million
dollars into the firm, which they say has helped launch social profiles for more than
70 students and coaches who have signed agreements with the firm.
Article 41 is fielding requests for similar work from other colleges like the
University of Michigan. It plans to seek compensation for its services from other
institutions, though it is not asking for money from U.N.C., where Ms. Segar and
Mr. Gildin are donors and Ms. Segar sits on a board for its athletic booster club.
The firm is intervening when brands send free products to athletes and insisting
that they are paid for posting about them. It’s also trying to sweeten existing
equipment deals between brands and teams by adding promises of social media
posts to their deals to help teams earn revenue.
Athleta is among the brands that have already struck paid deals with Ryleigh
Heck, a field hockey player, and Ms. Miller, the gymnast, but it does not officially
outfit U.N.C. athletes otherwise. Michelle Goad, Athleta’s chief digital officer, said it
was testing ads with the students in part to help “build a bridge to our next
generation of consumers,” and to see if the exposure could eventually exceed that
of traditional college sponsorships.
Asked if she’d thought about becoming a creator herself, Ms. Heck quickly responded, “I totally thought
about it and I’m so into it.”
Anna Frey, a 17-year-old tennis star from Farmington, Utah, will be one of the
biggest athlete-influencers on campus when she starts her freshman year at U.N.C.
this fall, with 2.1 million TikTok followers who watch posts of her serving tennis
balls, performing dances to popular TikTok sounds and going to school dances.
(She is also represented by ESM.)
Her father, Tanner Frey, said there were some serious cons to that sort of presence.
“I feel like 90 percent of people are so nice in the comments and 5 percent are mean
and 5 percent are perverts,” he said in an interview.
Mr. Frey said he had made a block list of “about probably 30 words” that Instagram
and TikTok could use to censor offensive comments on his daughter’s posts. He
said the “meanest, nastiest” comments came from gamblers who would berate his
daughter in the comments if she lost a match.
Still, he said it was “the best time ever in the history of the world to be a female
athlete,” in part because of the opportunities tied to brand deals and the new
N.C.A.A. rules for payments.
“Four years ago, none of this was even possible,” he said. “If Anna wanted to go
play college tennis, she’d have to make a really hard decision between that and
accepting half a million dollars a year from these brands and going pro.”
He added, “It’s nice they can go and do both now.”

Melissa Eddy,NYT,1,Business,4/24/2025,Trump’s Tariffs Expected to Grind Germany’s Growth to a Halt,"Germany’s economy will not grow for the third year in a row, the government said
on Thursday, scaling back a previous prediction as President Trump’s tariffs bite
into Europe’s largest economy, leaving it stagnant.
In January, the German government had predicted 0.3 percent economic growth,
but Mr. Trump’s tariffs of 25 percent on imported automobiles, steel and aluminum
threaten to hit Germany’s export-oriented economy hard, as could the turbulence
in the markets caused by the yo-yo nature of how the tariffs have been imposed.
“The German economy, which is already suffering from weak foreign demand and
reduced competitiveness, is particularly affected by the U.S. trade policy,” Robert
Habeck, Germany’s economy minister, told reporters in Berlin on Thursday.

Germany is the only member of the Group of 7 nations whose economy has failed
to grow in the past two years.
A new German government will take power after the expected next chancellor,
Friedrich Merz, is sworn in on May 6. He has promised to spur growth, aided by
looser borrowing limits that will allow the government to spend hundreds of
billions of euros on defense and infrastructure.
But many of the problems plaguing Germany are homegrown, and economists
warn that unless the country tackles some of the underlying structural problems —
including a burdensome bureaucracy, one of Europe’s highest corporate tax rates
and soaring energy prices — even the extended borrowing will not bring relief.
“It is still unclear whether and which reforms the next federal government will
implement,” Mr. Habeck said. “The structural problems must be tackled quickly
and consistently. This will determine whether the German economy receives a
boost to its competitiveness or whether all of the money goes up in smoke.”
Germany is also facing a demographic problem, leading to a shrinking work force
and a drop in productivity. At the same time, the country is grappling with a
surging anti-immigrant sentiment, which is making it difficult for companies to
attract the skilled foreign workers they need to remain competitive.
Many companies have scaled back their growth outlook as they digest the 10
percent blanket tariff on goods exported to the United States and await the
outcome of a 90-day pause on higher levies.
The trade war is expected to be a drag on the economy next year as well. The
government now predicts growth of 1 percent for 2026.
“If the new German government does not take decisive and swift
countermeasures, we could even face a significant third consecutive year of
recession,” said Helena Melnikov, managing director of the German Chamber of
Commerce and Industry.
“It is therefore all the more important that the future German government shifts
into forward gear and finds solutions to the customs dispute with the U.S.A.,
especially at the E.U. level,” Ms. Melnikov said.
This week, the International Monetary Fund also predicted that Germany’s
economy would not grow this year, cutting its forecast to 0 percent from 0.2 percent
in January. It noted that stronger consumption driven by rising wages and the
willingness of the next government in Berlin to take on more debt could have a
positive effect on growth.
Growth across the wider eurozone, which includes Germany and 26 other E.U.
members, was also scaled down to 0.8 percent from 1 percent, the I.M.F. said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/business/german-economy-trump-tariffs.html
Meaghan Tobin,NYT,1,Business,4/25/2025,China Is Weighing Tariff Exemptions on Some U.S. Imports,"The Chinese government is considering whether to exclude some essential
products from its retaliatory 125 percent tariffs on American goods, said the head of
an American business group in China.
Officials from China’s commerce ministry canvassed businesses in China to
identify imports from the United States that are crucial to supply chains and
vulnerable to China’s new trade barriers, Michael Hart, president of the American
Chamber of Commerce in China, said at an event in Beijing on Friday.
“There are some companies who have said that if a long-term tariff war continued,
their business model would not work in China and we would see them exit,” Mr.
Hart said. “We shared that with the Chinese government because they are of
course trying to foster foreign direct investment.”
Lifesaving drugs and other health care products were one of the clearest sectors of
concern, Mr. Hart said.

Markets in Asia and Europe rose on Friday as investors looked for signs that the
trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies were starting to ease.

The trade tensions pose a major challenge for China’s economic growth, which has
been powered by exports. President Trump ratcheted up tariffs this month to 145
percent for more than half of China’s exports to the United States.
Some factories in southern China have already suspended operations since the
beginning of this month, raising concerns about whether unemployment could
increase in China.
Chinese officials have responded by not only imposing extraordinary tariffs on U.S.
imports but encouraging consumers to buy products made in China.
But there are some goods that China does not make. China depends on foreign
companies for advanced computer chips, and many in the country’s tech industry
have hoped semiconductors will escape the tariffs.
There have also been indications that China may be relenting on tariffs on
semiconductors made in the United States. A state-backed trade association in
China said this month that a significant portion of advanced chips would be exempt

from China’s tariffs if they were made outside the United States even if they were
sold to China by an American company.
Many advanced chips are designed by American companies like Nvidia, Qualcomm
and AMD but manufactured in Taiwan. The guidance said that for the purposes of
tariffs, China would not consider such chips as originating in the United States.
Reports have circulated in Chinese media outlets and on Chinese social media this
week that Beijing had decided not to put tariffs on some semiconductor-related
products made in the United States. The Chinese government has not announced
such a policy.
On Thursday, a logistics and warehousing company in Shenzhen said on social
media that it had been notified that eight types of chip-related products originating
in the United States would be exempt from additional tariffs. A representative from
the company, when reached by phone on Friday, could not confirm the reports.
Caijing, a Chinese business magazine, published a report on the exemptions on
Friday morning. The report was removed within hours.
Guo Jiakun, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said he was not familiar
with the situation when he was asked on Friday at a news briefing whether China
was considering rolling back some tariffs on U.S. products.
“Right now we are in a situation of unintended consequences,” Mr. Hart said. “The
United States and China are both doing the same exercise where they are starting
to understand that there may have been some unintended consequences to
businesses and supply chains from the tariffs, and I think that’s why we are seeing
both of them look at making exceptions.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/business/china-considering-tariff-exemptions.html
Ana Swanson,NYT,1,Business,4/28/2025,"Howard Lutnick, Trump’s ‘Buoyant’ Trade Warrior, Flexes His Power Over Global Business","Since Howard Lutnick was tapped to serve as President Trump’s commerce
secretary, executives from some of the world’s largest companies have been trying
to win him over.
Leaders of Nvidia, Facebook, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and
Alphabet have visited his newly purchased $25 million property in Washington — a
16,250-square-foot mansion that Mr. Lutnick, a billionaire, recently quipped would
be “big enough for my ego” — to persuade him to adopt a business-friendly agenda.
As Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs to levels not seen in a century, Ford Motor,
General Motors and other companies that have built their businesses around
international trade reached out to Mr. Lutnick in the hope that he could persuade
the president to take a less aggressive approach. Some chief executives have put in
calls to the commerce secretary at midnight.
Mr. Lutnick, 63, heads a department that both promotes and regulates industry,
and he has been put in charge of overseeing trade. As a result, he has found himself
in a position of incredible influence, as the go-between for a president imposing
sweeping tariffs and the industries being crushed by them.
A former bond trader who amassed billions on Wall Street, Mr. Lutnick has become
one of the loudest salesmen for tariffs in an administration generally unified on
their benefits. He has publicly echoed the president’s message that big tariffs are
needed to revive American industry, and that if companies don’t like them, they
should build factories in the United States.
Howard Lutnick, the secretary of commerce, has become a go-to for major companies
seeking relief from tariffs. But he’s not always friendly to their interests.
But in internal conversations in the administration, he has often been a voice for
moderation. He argued in favor of Mr. Trump’s pausing his global tariffs for 90 days
after they sent convulsions through the stock and bond markets. And he has made
the case to the president to grant relief to certain favored industries, helping them
to win exemptions from billions of dollars of levies.
After the country’s biggest car companies argued to Mr. Lutnick that tariffs on
Canada and Mexico would hurt the competitiveness of U.S. auto factories, Mr.
Lutnick lobbied the president to secure a major exemption in March.
In April, Mr. Lutnick helped to push through exceptions that saved electronics
companies from severe China tariffs, after he and other officials received calls from
executives like Tim Cook of Apple and Michael Dell of Dell Technologies.
Mr. Trump appears to regret granting such exclusions. He has groused to
associates that he did not want to do them in the first place, and wrote on Truth
Social in April that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” saying electronics would be
subject to other tariffs in the future.
Companies have been left deeply confused about the direction of trade policy but
more determined than ever to lobby for lucrative exemptions.

Mr. Lutnick did not respond to a request for an interview. A spokesman for the
Commerce Department declined to comment. The New York Times spoke with
more than three dozen corporate executives and current and former employees of
the Commerce Department, the White House and Mr. Lutnick’s former Wall Street
firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, and others.
Mr. Lutnick is not always on the side of helping industry. Often he has employed
the threat of tariffs or other aggressive tactics against businesses to encourage
them to invest more in the United States.
For example, Mr. Lutnick has paused disbursements to companies from the CHIPS
program, a bipartisan, multibillion-dollar effort to rebuild America’s semiconductor
industry. Mr. Lutnick put pressure on some executives to increase their U.S.
investments if they want to receive their funds, even though companies have
already signed contracts for those payments, according to three people familiar
with the conversations.
He has also given companies the impression that they may get tariff relief by
investing more in the United States, and discussed holding tariffs paid by
companies in escrow, returning the money if they make U.S. investments.
Companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia have announced investments since
Mr. Trump began threatening tariffs.
As a former investment banker, Mr. Lutnick seems particularly interested in novel
ways to shore up government finances. He has backed Mr. Trump’s plan of selling
citizenship to wealthy foreigners with a “gold card,” and talked about the
government’s taking a cut from patents and innovations.

interested in novel ways to shore up government finances. Theo Wargo/Getty Images
Mr. Lutnick has floated renaming the Department of the Interior “the Department
of American Assets” and using tariff revenue to finance a new sovereign wealth
fund. He has also spoken passionately about establishing a new “investment
accelerator” that aims to cut red tape for investors.
Mr. Lutnick’s supporters say he brings fresh thinking that is badly needed in
Washington. But executives and foreign officials have described some of his
proposals as zany or harmful, and come away from conversations deeply unsettled,
half a dozen people familiar with the exchanges say.
And despite overseeing a sprawling government agency, Mr. Lutnick is working to
further expand his reach.
He has been moving to take control of the customs service in order to make Mr.
Trump’s “External Revenue Service” — which would collect import taxes — a
reality. Mr. Lutnick has also expressed interest in gaining authority over the U.S.
Postal Service. After Mr. Trump gave him “a whole 24 hours,” in Mr. Lutnick’s
words, to figure out how to fix the post office’s finances, Mr. Lutnick suggested
merging it into the Commerce Department and using mail carriers to do the
national census.
As a go-to adviser for the president, Mr. Lutnick has helped fan Mr. Trump’s
impulses and instincts. After Mr. Trump expressed concerns that the United States
was losing influence over the Panama Canal, Mr. Lutnick had a friend set up two
iPhones to record video of ship traffic through the canal, he told an audience at a
conference in Washington in March. Mr. Lutnick shared the videos with Mr. Trump,
and they lamented how much Chinese writing was on the side of the boats and
shipping containers. “The Panamanians had sold out,” he said.
Behind the Journalism
Our business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct
financial stake in companies they cover.
Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Few of the ideas that Mr. Lutnick appears most enthusiastic about fall within the
traditional purview of the Commerce Department, an agency with roughly 50,000
employees that oversees business, weather monitoring, fisheries, artificial
intelligence and commercial space activity.
Within the department, employees say morale has plummeted, as the
administration has piled on work and slashed hundreds of jobs. Technologists and
scientists who have devoted their careers to making the United States more
globally competitive — one of the Trump administration’s stated goals — say they
have been left rudderless.
Some Commerce employees said that Mr. Lutnick, unlike past secretaries, did not
send a welcome email or give a welcome address, and that they did not know his
email or see him in person for a month after his confirmation. Mr. Lutnick has told
others that he planned to spend most of his time at the White House.
Many employees believe Mr. Lutnick is focused on an audience of one: the man he
refers to as “DJT.” Mr. Lutnick often speaks of the president’s intuition, wisdom and
prescience; has boasted of having regular Friday night dinners with Mr. Trump;
and describes any day that he speaks to the president as a “good day.”
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of health and human services, said Mr. Lutnick
had a “unique chemistry” with the president and “an instinct for finding hidden
levers of power to implement policy.” He described Mr. Lutnick as “garrulous,
funny and irrepressibly buoyant.”
“I think if you cut his head off, he’d still be smiling,” Mr. Kennedy said.
Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, described Mr. Lutnick as
“relentless” and said they were “very close partners” in developing and executing
trade policy. “The country is extremely fortunate to have him in public service,” he
said.
At a dinner in the Australian Embassy in February where he gave the keynote
speech, Mr. Lutnick said he had first brushed with Mr. Trump decades ago at New
York charity dinners, after which they would go out and “chase the same girls.” The
line was met with awkward silence, a person in attendance said.
Mr. Lutnick told the group of foreign dignitaries and investors that the U.S.
economy was greatest at the turn of the 20th century, when it had high tariffs on
foreign products. He said Mr. Trump planned to construct “a tariff wall” around the
United States and urged foreign countries to be on the right side of it.
Some foreign governments that have negotiated with Mr. Lutnick have described
him as brash and aggressive. Canadian officials say he issued a series of
devastating threats in a February phone call, warning that Mr. Trump could eject
Canada from the intelligence-sharing group the Five Eyes and review the defense
system that shields both countries from foreign missiles.
Mexican officials, in contrast, described Mr. Lutnick as tough but engaging, and
said he was receptive to their arguments that automotive supply chains that run
between the countries can be beneficial for U.S. factories.
“With us, he was constructive,” said Luis Rosendo Gutiérrez Romano, the Mexican
deputy secretary for trade.
Mr. Lutnick seems to be relishing his role in Mr. Trump’s orbit. He threw himself a
lavish confirmation party in February at his Washington home. Mr. Lutnick and his
wife, Allison, mingled with senators, Wall Street traders and executives like Meta’s
Mark Zuckerberg.
Many Commerce Department employees believe that Mr. Lutnick is focused on an

He has also embraced the media spotlight. Some of his near-daily TV appearances
have set off alarm among Trump officials and allies, as well as charges from
Democrats that Mr. Trump’s billionaire cabinet is out of touch.
In late March, Mr. Lutnick said in an interview that only a “fraudster” would
complain about missing a Social Security check, and that his 94-year-old mother-in-
law “wouldn’t call and complain.”
In April, Mr. Lutnick said in a TV interview that “the army of millions and millions
of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones — that kind of
thing is going to come to America.”
While new to Washington, Mr. Lutnick served for more than 30 years as the chief
executive of Cantor Fitzgerald, the New York brokerage firm, and carved out a
substantial fortune in a brutally competitive industry. He also led BGC Group, a
broker dealer, and was a top executive at Newmark, a commercial property firm.
Mr. Lutnick’s life was tinged with tragedy that made him more protective over
friends and family and encouraged him to build an empire of wealth around them.
He lost both his parents suddenly as a young man. And Cantor Fitzgerald lost
hundreds of employees, including Mr. Lutnick’s brother and best friend, during the
Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center, where its offices were.
Some former employees said Mr. Lutnick had treated them like family, taking them
to Six Flags and the circus and buying them popcorn and cotton candy. Others
recalled that Mr. Lutnick would leave the office to eat dinner with his family, then
come back for meetings at 10 p.m., which he expected employees to attend.
Jimmy Dunne, the vice chairman of Piper Sandler, an investment bank that has
worked with Cantor, described Mr. Lutnick as “very intense and very tough.”
“You go to battle with him or against him, you better be pretty secure because he’s
going to test you,” Mr. Dunne said. “He doesn’t shy away from a fight.”
Mr. Lutnick described himself as a fiscal conservative and social liberal, and he has
a history of supporting both Republicans and Democrats. But his strong support
for Israel and conservative economics helped sway him toward Mr. Trump.
Employees who had known Mr. Lutnick for a long time were surprised in 2020 to
hear him question the results of the presidential election. In 2024, Mr. Lutnick was
a major donor to Mr. Trump and then co-chair of his transition team. Mr. Lutnick
vied to become Treasury secretary, but lost out to the hedge fund manager Scott
Bessent. The hostility between the two men has not abated, despite their working
together to persuade Mr. Trump to pause some of his tariffs.

Jack Ewing,NYT,1,Business,4/27/2025,Tesla and Volkswagen May Have a Leg Up As Tariffs Raise EV Prices,"President Trump’s tariffs on imported cars and auto parts could stall the growth of
electric vehicles, setting back a technology critical to addressing climate change.
But the tariffs could also work in favor of some electric models made in the United
States, like the Tesla Model Y or Volkswagen ID.4, that are among the cars with the
fewest imported parts and, thus, the least vulnerable to tariffs.
The tariffs could lead to steep increases in the cost of batteries and other
components. By hurting electric vehicle manufacturing in the United States, the
tariffs could also cede more ground to Chinese automakers that have a substantial
lead.
One thing is clear: The tariffs will raise prices for all vehicles — gasoline, electric
or hybrid — and could lead to severe parts shortages if some suppliers go out of
business. There will be ripple effects that no one can predict. But vehicles that are
subjected to lower tariffs could gain a competitive advantage.

E.V. supply chains may be easier to overhaul
Electric vehicles have far fewer parts than cars that run on gasoline or diesel. In
theory, it should be easier for carmakers to source parts from the United States,
avoiding tariffs.
Efforts to create a domestic supply chain for electric vehicles are well underway, in
part because of Biden administration policies that provided loans and subsidies to
battery factories and other projects.
LG Energy Solution, a South Korean battery maker, runs three battery factories in
the United States that supply General Motors and other customers. Three more LG
plants will begin producing batteries next year, and a seventh is planned.

The problem is that many battery raw materials come from China and may face
stiff tariffs. For example, China dominates the supply of refined graphite, an
essential ingredient in most electric vehicle batteries.
American companies are working on producing battery-grade graphite, lithium
and other key materials. But it will be several years before these operations can
replace Chinese suppliers.
Some E.V.s are already the most American-made
Workers assembling an electric drivetrain at a General Motors plant in Spring Hill,

All the cars that Tesla sells in the United States are made in California or Texas.
Last year, Tesla’s Model Y sport utility vehicle topped Cars.com’s annual American-
made index, which uses data that automakers submit to the federal government
and other sources to rank vehicles according to how much of their content and
labor originates in the United States.
Tesla uses some parts from Mexico and China that will be subject to tariffs, but less
so than other automakers. That gives the Model Y, Tesla’s most popular vehicle, a
cost advantage that could narrow the price gap with conventional cars. On
average, sale prices for electric vehicles are $12,000 more than comparable
vehicles with internal combustion engines, according to Cox Automotive.
“We do have localized supply chains in both America, Europe and China,” Elon
Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, said last week on a conference call with analysts
and investors. “So that puts us in a stronger position than our competitors.”
Another vehicle relatively insulated from tariffs is the Volkswagen ID.4, an electric
sport utility vehicle made in Tennessee with a battery from Georgia.
“That’s not a bad thought,” Kjell Gruner, the president of Volkswagen Group of
America, said last week when a reporter asked whether the ID.4 might gain a
competitive advantage.
But he added that figuring out the ultimate impact of tariffs was extremely difficult
because many variables were at play and because Mr. Trump’s trade policies
changed frequently. Mr. Gruner said he started each day with a meeting with other
executives to discuss the latest developments.
“You need to look at your entire value chain, from logistics to manufacturing,
procurement, sales and marketing,” Mr. Gruner said. “You need to get into the
weeds.”
Mr. Musk has warned that tariffs will also be bad for Tesla and said he had failed to
talk the president out of them.
Automakers may favor more profitable gasoline vehicles
Except for Tesla, most carmakers don’t make much or any money on electric
vehicles. Carmakers may decide to curtail production of those cars and focus on
gasoline pickups and sport utility vehicles that usually are very profitable.
The risk is that, by delaying rollouts of electric vehicles, U.S. carmakers will lose
their ability to compete with Chinese, South Korean and European carmakers that
are expanding their electric lineups. There is near unanimity in the industry that
sooner or later electric vehicles will become more popular than cars with internal
combustion engines.
“It’s hard to figure out how you net out the massive costs potentially associated
with tariffs with the need to continue to invest in the future,” said John Bozzella,
president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry association.
Some tariffs will fall harder on E.V.s
Electric vehicles usually have more semiconductors than cars with internal
combustion engines and would be hit harder by tariffs on chips that Mr. Trump has
signaled may be coming.
Some tariffs may also apply to charging equipment, which could slow the recent
rapid growth of stations where people can plug in vehicles. Fear of not being able to
find a charger has kept many people from buying electric vehicles.
The motors in most electric vehicles use magnets that contain rare earth minerals,
which will be in short supply because of restrictions that China recently imposed in
retaliation to U.S. tariffs.
The rare earths crunch will probably come in the second half of the year, said Neha
Mukherjee, lead rare earths analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.
“There are stockpiles already in the market which can suffice for now,” Ms.
Mukherjee said. If the restrictions continue, she said, “we’ll see prices ticking
higher.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/business/tariffs-tesla-volkswagen-evs.html
Jacob Gallagher,NYT,1,Business,4/24/2025,"With Underdog Brand, Jason Kelce Takes ‘Made in the U.S.’ Seriously","Jason Kelce, a mellow mountain of a man, has spent most of his life fretting over
offensive snaps.
Now, a year into his retirement after 13 seasons as a center for the Philadelphia
Eagles, Mr. Kelce has space to puzzle over other matters. Lately, he’s been thinking
about sweatshirts and T-shirts. And he has thoughts. Lots of thoughts.
“On the inside of a sweatshirt, I don’t like when it feels fuzzy,” said Mr. Kelce,
speaking on a video call from his Philadelphia home in April, just a few days after
the birth of his fourth daughter. He wants a “heavier-duty” sweatshirt, with a
smidge of stretch. Something durable, “that you can wear working or lounging
around on the couch.”
Oh, and it needs to be made entirely in the United States.
To achieve all this, Mr. Kelce, 37, has taken matters into his own hands. Today, his
Underdog apparel brand is debuting a tidy collection of crew neck sweatshirts and
T-shirts, all produced — from the cotton to the completed garment — in the United
States. These items are produced in collaboration with American Giant, a San
Francisco-based company formed in 2012 that manufactures entirely in the United
States.
The American Giant-produced Underdog pocket T-shirts and French terry
sweatshirts will sell for $45 and $79, respectively, and will be sold on the Underdog
website. They are, to Mr. Kelce’s specifications, on the burlier side. During the
interview, he wore the pocket T-shirt in green, his abundant biceps mildly squeezed
by the sleeves.
Underdog has released a pocket T-shirt and a French terry sweatshirt, both of which had design input
from Mr. Kelce. Underdog
“I don’t want to offend anybody, I never understood the reason that somebody
would want to wear Gucci, or some of these high-end brands,” said Mr. Kelce,
leaving unsaid that his brother, Travis, has been known to wear a Gucci hat or two.
“It’s never appealed to me.”
“I would much rather wear something that symbolized a blue-collar worker as
opposed to a suit,” he added, even if he does have to wriggle into a suit when he
appears as an analyst for “Monday Night Countdown” on ESPN.
That Underdog’s clothes are entirely made in the United States is the most
gratifying part to Mr. Kelce.
“I grew up going into steel mills with my father,” he said of his childhood in
Cleveland Heights, Ohio. “So, the concept of American workers making things was
something that was ingrained early. And I just always gravitated toward it.”
Mr. Kelce has long been plotting for life after his last snap. In 2022, he started the
“New Heights” podcast with his brother. It remains in the top 200 of Apple’s top
podcasts, though it now runs behind his wife Kylie’s show, “Not Gonna Lie.”
While many retired athletes pour money into car dealerships or restaurant
ventures, Mr. Kelce became curious about clothes.
“I was trying to come up with what’s a way that we can celebrate Philadelphia,”
said Mr. Kelce, who is nothing if not an unofficial ambassador for his adopted city.
“And I love wearing shirts that represent me and everything that I believe in.”
Bayard Winthrop, the chief executive of American Giant, said Mr. Kelce “had lots of small opinions” on

He started Underdog in 2022 as an apparel brand with vigorous nods to
Philadelphia. Past graphics featured his Eagles teammates, and the name alludes
to the Eagles having labeled themselves as underdogs on their way to winning the
Super Bowl in 2018. It is a unique proposition from a former athlete, and one that
has, to many outside the Eagles fandom, perhaps flown under the radar. Underdog
does not have the techy edge of say, Tom Brady’s slick, fitness-centric Brady brand.
It leans more on Mr. Kelce’s jolly, jumbo-size profile than on his on-field prowess.
The label has made prior attempts at producing in the United States, though Mr.
Kelce soon learned that even if the tag said an item had been made here, “a good
portion of that might be made overseas.” Garments that read “Made in the United
States” can be produced from cotton or other components that derive from
elsewhere.
In American Giant, Underdog found a partner that was capable of producing the
whole garment, including the fabric, here in the United States. The cotton was
harvested and finished in the Southeast, including in North Carolina. The garments
themselves were produced in Los Angeles.
“These fabrics were custom-designed for Jason,” said Bayard Winthrop, the chief
executive of American Giant who underscored that the ex-Pro-Bowler “had lots of
small opinions” about how the shirts and sweats should fit and feel.
“The shirts have a really gutsy, sturdy quality to them,” said Mr. Winthrop. “They
drape a certain way. They’re not clingy to the body. They’re not overly delicate.”
Mr. Kelce and his Philadelphia Eagles teammates labeled
themselves as underdogs ahead of the Super Bowl in 2018,
which helped inspire the brand’s name and logo. Michelle

Last year, Mr. Kelce traveled with Mr. Winthrop to North and South Carolina see
the production process firsthand, giving him a look at how clothes are made that
few people ever see, or even consider. With most apparel manufacturing having
been exported overseas, only 2 percent of the clothing Americans buy is
manufactured domestically.
“The eye-opening part for me was how truly decentralized this is, how many
people touch just one T-shirt and how many steps there are in that process,” said
Mr. Kelce. “I had never really thought much about that.”
Though this project has been in the works for around two years, it debuts at an
auspicious moment, as Americans are contemplating what they’re willing to
sacrifice — macro- and micro-economically — to bring back American
manufacturing. Hours before the interview, President Trump pulled back on steep
tariffs that had unsettled the global economic landscape, though a tit-for-tat trade
war with China has continued.
“I have no issues with global trade whatsoever,” said Mr. Kelce, who was
evenhanded about the impact of his small stab at making his goods solely in the
United States. He was, he said, not going to stop buying shirts and clothes that
were not totally made here.
“I don’t think there’s any type of statement trying to be made other than, ‘Listen,
there’s some really awesome reasons to support homegrown American businesses
and local businesses,’” he said.
For the company’s initial wave of products, Underdog used cotton harvested and finished in the

Considering Mr. Kelce’s longstanding love affair with Philadelphia, it may strike
some shoppers as odd that the Underdog line is not produced there. It was
discussed, but the reality, said Mr. Winthrop, was that Philadelphia, like many cities
that were once manufacturing hubs, was “gutted out” when it came to apparel
production.
“There is no at-scale dyeing or finishing or knitting capability in Philly,” he said. Mr.
Kelce said that in the future, the company would find ways to incorporate the city
into its brand. His partner, Stephen Porter, noted that anything Underdog screen
printed or embroidered was done locally.
The line might not be made in Philadelphia, but his green shirt proved that Mr.
Kelce knew he had to keep his fans happy.
“Philadelphia bleeds green,” he said. “If we didn’t have a green shirt, it would have
felt like malpractice.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/style/jason-kelce-underdog-made-in-

Santul Nerkar,NYT,1,Business,5/2/2025,Former Abercrombie C.E.O. Ruled Unfit to Stand Trial for Sex Trafficking,"Michael S. Jeffries, the former chief executive of Abercrombie and Fitch who was
charged with running an international sex-trafficking ring, on Friday was found
unfit to stand trial because of an Alzheimer’s diagnosis.
In a three-page order, Judge Nusrat J. Choudhury of the Eastern District of New
York, wrote that Mr. Jeffries was “suffering from a mental disease or defect
rendering him mentally incompetent.” Judge Choudhury also ordered that Mr.
Jeffries be hospitalized for four months to observe whether his condition improves.
The ruling followed a letter filed last month by Mr. Jeffries’s lawyers, Brian H.
Bieber and Alek Ubieta. They wrote that, based on the independent evaluation of
three doctors, Mr. Jeffries, 80, had severe dementia and Alzheimer’s, which
“ensures continued decline over time.” The condition meant Mr. Jeffries could not
understand the charges he was facing, his lawyers wrote.
Mr. Jeffries was indicted last October on charges that, from 2008 to 2015, he
coerced dozens of men into sex with him, using his position as the clothing
retailer’s chief executive to sexually exploit models who were motivated to
advance their careers. He had pleaded not guilty.
Working with his romantic partner, Matthew Smith, and a third person, James
Jacobson, Mr. Jeffries lured the men to secret sex parties with the possibility that
they’d receive modeling jobs, federal prosecutors said. Mr. Smith and Mr. Jacobson
have also been charged with sex trafficking, and, like Mr. Jeffries, have pleaded not
guilty.
According to prosecutors, the men that Mr. Jeffries and his co-defendants coerced
were not allowed to leave the sex parties. Along with being forced into sex, they
were made to consume alcohol, drugs and Viagra. The charges echoed claims made
in a class-action lawsuit brought against Abercrombie in 2023 and reported on in a
BBC investigation.
The defendants “used their money and influence to prey on vulnerable men for
their own sexual gratification,” Breon Peace, the former U.S. attorney for the
Eastern District, said in a statement last October.
Though Mr. Jeffries was credited with saving Abercrombie from bankruptcy in the
early 1990s, the company faced a variety of crises under his stewardship, well
before last year’s criminal indictment.
When Mr. Jeffries left the company in 2014, the company was facing backlash over
what many customers saw as its hypersexualized imagery of young models, and it
had been enduring sliding sales.
In 2004, Abercrombie agreed to pay $40 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that
accused the company of favoring white employees over Black, Hispanic and Asian
workers. In 2012, it faced an age-discrimination lawsuit that claimed that
employees on Abercrombie’s Gulfstream jet were required to respond to any of Mr.
Jeffries’s requests with “no problem.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/nyregion/abercrombie-jeffries-unfit-

Daisuke Wakabayashi;Mike Isaac,NYT,1,Business,5/3/2025,Trump’s Tariff on Cheap Chinese Imports Will Cost Big Tech Billions,"The expansion of the loophole for tariff-free shipments of goods nearly a decade
ago gave rise to Temu, Shein and other low-cost online retailers offering items
straight from Chinese factories at unfathomable discounts.
It also unleashed something else — a cascade of billions of dollars of digital
advertising that provided a windfall for Meta, Alphabet and other technology
industry giants. Temu and Shein, jockeying for the attention of American shoppers,
blanketed seemingly every inch of the internet with their ads. In the last two years,
only Amazon spent more on online advertising in the United States than Shein or
Temu.
Now, the advertising bonanza might be coming to an end after the demise of the
shipping loophole that spurred it.
On Friday, President Trump eliminated the exemption that had allowed goods
made in mainland China and Hong Kong valued at less than $800 to enter the
United States without being subject to import taxes. For Temu and Shein, this
means they are now subject to tariffs of as much as 145 percent to bring over
Chinese goods. Last week, Temu started adding “import charges” to certain
products, which more than doubled the overall price to buy and ship the items.
A Temu spokesperson said on Friday that the company had stopped shipping
products from China directly to customers in the United States, and that its U.S.
orders would now be shipped from local warehouses in America, as the business
“transitions to a local fulfillment model.” Shein did not immediately respond to an
email requesting comment.
The new tariffs are expected to deal a punishing blow to companies built on selling
goods at rock-bottom prices and attracting customers through aggressive online
advertising.

Using the slogan “Shop Like a Billionaire,” Temu bought advertising time during
the Super Bowl.
Temu’s parent company, PDD Holdings, used a similar strategy for its Chinese e-
commerce app, Pinduoduo, in China, spending lavishly on advertising to grow
rapidly in a competitive market.
Sky Canaves, a principal analyst for retail and e-commerce at the research firm
eMarketer, said the ads from Temu and Shein were once “inescapable” on search,
social media and apps. But that is changing.
“They’ve already pulled back their advertising pretty heavily,” she said.
Over a two-week period starting March 31, Temu spent 31 percent less on U.S. daily
advertising on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snap, X and YouTube than its average
daily spending on those platforms in the previous 30 days, according to estimates
from Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm. Shein’s daily advertising outlays on
its social networks in the United States were down 19 percent over the same two
weeks.

Here’s more on our standards and practices.
Temu and Shein, which had flooded Google in the United States with ads for the
goods they sell, started to disappear from the platform in April. On April 5, Temu
accounted for 19 percent of all U.S. ads displayed on Google Shopping, but that
figure dropped to zero a week later, according to research by Tinuiti, a marketing
firm. Shein went from around 20 percent in early April to zero by April 16.
Tinuiti identified the tariffs as the main factor behind the advertising pullback. It
said the reduction in spending coincided with the raising of prices by both
companies on certain products.
Without the constant advertising presence, Temu’s and Shein’s apps have fallen off
the charts of the 10 most downloaded mobile apps in the United States. Temu
served about 30 million daily users in the United States, the company disclosed in a
lawsuit filed against Shein in 2023.
Temu and Shein flooded the internet with ads, trailing only Amazon in U.S. online ad

At Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, some Asian retailers
had already reduced their U.S. advertising spending in anticipation of the end of
the so-called de minimis exemption, Susan Li, Meta’s chief financial officer, said on
a conference call with investors on Wednesday. Some of the spending has been
redirected to Meta platforms in other markets, but the spending in April was down
from a year earlier, she said. Ms. Li did not name any of the companies.
Investors were closely watching what Meta said because advertisers from China,
led by Temu and Shein, had been one of the company’s fastest-growing segments.
Last year, advertisers from China generated $18.4 billion in revenue for Meta,
accounting for about 11 percent of its total and more than doubling in size since
2022.
Snap, a social media firm, said that “a subset of advertisers” had cut back on
spending because of the changes to the shipping loophole. The company declined to
provide a forecast for its current quarter, citing the uncertainty caused by the
tariffs. Snap’s shares fell 12 percent after the announcement.
Last week, Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said changes to the
tariff loophole “will obviously cause a slight headwind to our ads business in 2025,”
primarily from Asian e-commerce companies. He also did not identify specific
companies.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/business/china-tariffs-temu-shein.html
Colby Smith,NYT,1,Business,5/2/2025,Solid Jobs Report Reinforces Fed’s Patient Approach to Interest Rate Cuts,"A solid labor market has for months given the Federal Reserve comfort that it
could hold off on interest rate cuts until it had more clarity about how President
Trump’s policies would impact the economy. New data released on Friday
reinforced that patient approach.
Officials at the central bank are widely expected to keep interest rates steady when
they announce their next decision on May 7. After lowering interest rates by a
percentage point last year, the Fed has since January opted against making
additional reductions. That has left interest rates at a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5
percent.
Until this point, officials have felt little urgency to lower interest rates because the
economy so far has stayed on solid footing. Mr. Trump’s attempts to reset global
trade relations through steep tariffs now risk upending that.
Despite the president’s decision in April to temporarily pause more stringent levies
from taking effect on nearly all of the country’s trading partners, businesses have
struggled to navigate the uncertainty. Many have shelved big investments and
slowed hiring, and some are already raising prices. Surveys suggest that
consumers also have turned much more downbeat about the outlook, fueling
concern that this pessimism will eventually translate to less spending.
The fear is that consumers will cut back so aggressively that businesses will be
forced to lay off workers, worsening the economic slowdown. Jerome H. Powell, the
chair of the central bank, has warned that in addition to denting growth, tariffs of
the nature Mr. Trump is pursuing also risk stoking inflation.

That combination risks putting the Fed in a bind and further in the cross hairs of
Mr. Trump. The president has in recent weeks stepped up his attacks on Mr. Powell,
railing on the Fed chair to lower interest rates. On Friday, he again renewed that
pressures, writing in a social media post: “NO INFLATION, THE FED SHOULD
LOWER ITS RATE!!!”
The central bank is responsible for fostering low, stable inflation as well as a
healthy labor market. Officials are now having to game out what they would do if
their goals for the economy come into tension with one another.

The latest jobs report, which showed better-than-expected monthly payrolls
growth and a steady unemployment rate, is welcome news for officials. It follows
inflation data earlier this week that confirmed that in March, price pressures
stayed somewhat subdued even as it remained above the Fed’s 2 percent target.
Officials are now debating whether the forthcoming surge in consumer prices will
just be a temporary adjustment that fades over time, or if it will lead to persistently
higher inflation.
Having just grappled with surging inflation in the aftermath of the pandemic, the
Fed has stressed the importance of ensuring that tariff-related price pressures do
not mushroom into a bigger problem. Last month, Mr. Powell said that containing
inflation was crucial to fostering a healthy labor market.
“Without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor market
conditions that benefit all Americans,” he said at an event at the Economic Club of
Chicago.
That emphasis suggests there is a high bar for the Fed to restart interest rate cuts.
Officials will need to see clear evidence that the economy is weakening before
taking action, something that could take time.
Christopher J. Waller, a governor, said in a recent interview that he did not expect
tariffs to impact the economy in a significant way before July, suggesting no near-
term cuts.
Preston Mui, a senior economist at research and advocacy group Employ America,
said he expects the labor market to gradually slow over the next couple of months
rather than sharply collapse.
“When it gets sharp is when you have these big spikes in layoffs,” he said. That will
depend on what Mr. Trump does with tariffs. If the president reverses course by
the self-imposed 90-day deadline in early July, the labor market may avoid a more
painful hit. If tariffs remain in place, or the uncertainty around trade policy lingers,
the damage could start to mount.
After Friday’s report, traders in federal funds futures markets scaled back their
expectations for interest rate cuts from the central bank this year. They see much
lower odds of a June reduction but continue to forecast a quarter-point cut in July.
Over the course of the year, they see the Fed cutting at least three times.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/business/fed-jobs-interest-rates.html

Updated April 27, 2025
Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring who said she was
“passed around like a platter of fruit” as a teenager to rich and powerful predators,
including Prince Andrew of Britain, died on Friday at her farm in Western
Australia. She was 41.
Ms. Giuffre (pronounced JIFF-ree) died by suicide, according to a statement by the
family. She wrote in an Instagram post in March that she was days away from
dying of renal failure after being injured in an automobile crash with a school bus
that she said was traveling at nearly 70 miles per hour.
In the statement, her family called her “a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual
abuse and sex trafficking” and “the light that lifted so many survivors.”
In 2019, Mr. Epstein was arrested and charged by federal prosecutors in the
Southern District of New York with sex-trafficking and conspiracy, accused of
soliciting teenage girls to perform massages that became increasingly sexual in
nature.
Virginia Giuffre, Voice in Epstein Sex-
Trafficking Scandal, Dies at 41
Barely a month after he was apprehended, and a day after documents were
released from Ms. Giuffre’s successful defamation suit against him, Mr. Epstein
was found hanged in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower
Manhattan. His death, at 66, was ruled a suicide.
In 2009, Ms. Giuffre, identified then only as Jane Doe 102, sued Mr. Epstein,
accusing him and Ghislaine Maxwell, his co-conspirator and the daughter of the
disgraced British media magnate Robert Maxwell, of recruiting her to join his sex-
trafficking ring when she was a minor under the guise of becoming a professional
masseuse.

In 2015, she was the first of Mr. Epstein’s victims to give up her anonymity and go
public, selling her story to the British tabloid The Mail on Sunday.
“Basically, I was training to be a prostitute for him and his friends who shared his
interest in young girls,” Ms. Giuffre was quoted as saying in Nigel Cawthorne’s
2022 book, “Virginia Giuffre: The Extraordinary Life Story of the Masseuse Who
Pursued and Ended the Sex Crimes of Millionaires Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey
Epstein.”
“Ghislaine told me that I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey,” she said.
Ms. Giuffre accused Mr. Epstein, a multimillionaire financier, and Ms. Maxwell, a
British socialite, of forcing her to have sex with Prince Andrew, also known as the
Duke of York. He flatly denied the accusations, but he relinquished his royal duties
in 2019.
In 2021, she sued the prince, who is the younger brother of King Charles III of
England, contending that he had sexually assaulted her at Ms. Maxwell’s home in
London and at Mr. Epstein’s homes in Manhattan and Little St. James, in the Virgin
Islands.
A widely published photograph showed Prince Andrew with his hand around her
waist. He said he had no memory of the occasion.
After Prince Andrew agreed to settle the suit by Ms. Giuffre in 2022, he praised her
in a statement for speaking out and pledged to “demonstrate his regret” for his
association with Mr. Epstein “by supporting the fight against the evils of sex
trafficking, and by supporting its victims.”
The settlement included an undisclosed sum to be paid to her and to her charity,
now called Speak Out, Act, Reclaim.

District Court — Southern District.
In interviews and depositions, Ms. Giuffre said she was recruited to the sex ring in
2000 while working as a locker room attendant at Mar-a-Lago, President Trump’s
resort in Palm Beach, Fla. By her account, she was reading a massage therapy
manual when she was approached by Ms. Maxwell and invited to become Mr.
Epstein’s traveling masseuse. She said the two of them then groomed her to
perform sexual services for wealthy men.
Ms. Giuffre sued Ms. Maxwell for defamation in 2015 for calling her a liar; they
settled for an undisclosed sum in 2017. Ms. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of sex
trafficking and other counts. The verdict was viewed as the legal reckoning that
Mr. Epstein had denied the judicial system, and his victims, by hanging himself.
Ms. Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Virginia Louise Roberts was born on Aug. 9, 1983, in Sacramento to Sky and Lynn
Roberts. When she was 4, the family moved to Palm Beach County, where her
father was a maintenance manager at Mar-a-Lago.

She said she ran away from home after having been molested by a close family
friend since she was 7. She was placed in foster homes; boarded with an aunt in
California; fled to the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco, the former
hippie haven; lived on the streets when she was 14; and spent six months with a
65-year-old sex trafficker, who abused her.
Compared with living on the streets and earning $9 an hour for her summer job at
Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Epstein’s offer to make $200 a massage several times a day was,
Mr. Cawthorne wrote, one that “Virginia had determined for herself she could not
refuse.”
But her mandate went well beyond those duties, she told the BBC in 2019: She said
that she was “passed around like a platter of fruit” to Mr. Epstein’s friends and
ferried around the world on private jets.
In 2002, when she was 19, Ms. Giuffre enrolled in the International Training
Massage School in Thailand to become a professional masseuse. There she met
Robert Giuffre, an Australian martial arts instructor, and they married.
The couple had three children, Christian, Noah and Emily, and lived in Australia,
Florida and Colorado before settling in Perth in 2020. They have since separated.
He and their children survive her, as do her mother and two brothers, Sky Roberts
and Danny Wilson.
Ms. Giuffre told The Miami Herald in 2019 that the birth of her daughter in 2010
prompted her to speak publicly about her victimization. She explained why she had
originally agreed to work as a masseuse for Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, and to
provide sexual services.
“They seemed like nice people,” she said, “so I trusted them, and I told them I’d had
a really hard time in my life up until then — I’d been a runaway, I’d been sexually
abused, physically abused. That was the worst thing I could have told them,
because now they knew how vulnerable I was.”

Julie Creswell,NYT,1,Business,4/25/2025,RFK Jr. Wants to Ban Food Dyes. Manufacturers Are in No Hurry.,"Same cereal. Same sugary taste. Different hues.
A box of Froot Loops sold in the United States contains vivid rings of red, orange,
green, purple, yellow and blue — neon colors derived from synthetic dyes, like Red
No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Blue No. 1 and Yellow No. 6. In a box sold in Canada, the
colored rings obtain paler shades from the juices of blueberries, watermelon and
huito, an Amazonian fruit. And not a single one is blue.
The manufacturer in both countries, WK Kellogg, formerly known as the Kellogg
Company, can clearly make Froot Loops without synthetic dyes. The question is:
Will it and other big food companies adopt the approach in United States? And will
consumers, raised on color-popping cereals, flame-colored nacho chips and neon
blue sports drinks consume those foods if they are a bit more … beige?
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services, wants them to. On Tuesday, Mr. Kennedy, who has long criticized artificial
dyes used in Froot Loops and other processed foods as part of a larger food system
No More Food Dye in Froot Loops? Not So Fast.
that he says contributes to chronic disease and poor health, announced that he had
reached “an understanding” with major food manufacturers to remove commonly
used petroleum-based food colorings from their products by 2026.
The meaning of “an understanding” remains unclear. No food companies attended
the press conference, and few have said they will remove synthetic colors, which
the Food and Drug Administration currently allows. But a shift may be coming.
This week, citing expected demand from consumers, the beverage giant PepsiCo,
which also makes Doritos and Lay’s potato chips, said it would either phase out
synthetic colors or offer consumers natural color options in the next couple of
years.
Mr. Kennedy is perhaps hoping that using his bully pulpit as head of the agency
that oversees the F.D.A. will be enough to push big food companies to change their
ways. They have responded to pressure before. About a decade ago, a number of
companies tried shifting to natural colors. Most notably, Kraft Macaroni & Cheese
successfully replicated its characteristic orange noodles by switching to turmeric
and paprika. But other companies struggled. Some reverted to synthetic dyes after
sales slumped.
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said he had reached “an understanding” with major food
manufacturers to remove commonly used petroleum-based food colorings from their products by 2026.

For some critics of synthetic dyes, however, Mr. Kennedy’s announcement was a
disappointment. Dr. Peter Lurie, a former F.D.A. official and the executive director
of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the government should move
more forcefully to eliminate the dyes.
“History tells us that relying on voluntary food industry compliance has all too
often proven to be a fool’s errand,” Dr. Lurie said in a statement.
Rewriting the Recipe
No matter how much pressure Washington exerts, shifting to natural colors won’t
happen overnight. It is not as easy as simply replacing Yellow No. 6 with carrot
juice, said James Herrmann, marketing director of food colors at Sensient
Technologies, a company that manufactures colors — both artificial and natural —
for the food and beverage industry.
It can take up to two years to develop the seeds, grow the plants and concoct the
combination of, say, red cabbage and black carrot extract that produces a desired
shade, he said. And it’s not just getting the color right. Food companies are likely to
have to make adjustments to their manufacturing processes and facilities.
Light and heat are enemies of natural colors, causing them to fade, change or even,
in some cases, separate, Mr. Herrmann said. Natural colors must be kept cool, and
they have a relatively short shelf life, which means adding refrigeration and
ensuring a steady supply of them, he said. He added that colors from carrot or beet
juice and their synthetic cousins might have different viscosities, requiring
factories to change pumps or the piping used to apply the colors.
Also, more natural dye is needed to achieve a satisfying color than synthetic dye,
so recipes may have to be reformulated. “Your sugar or flour may be off,” Mr.
Herrmann said.
And that’s assuming enough carrots, cabbage, beets and spirulina (an algae) are
available to replicate the oranges, greens and blues of chips and sports drinks. Mr.
Herrmann, whose company uses proprietary seeds for most of its colorings, said
he wouldn’t “put the seed in the ground for the crop until we know there’s a
customer there for it.”
“If everybody switches at once,” he added, “there is simply not enough material
around the world available to meet the demand.”
Because it can take 10 times as much material from natural colors to mimic a small
amount of synthetic dyes, costs could very likely climb as well.

Late Tuesday, the Consumer Brands Association, the trade organization for the
food industry, said in a statement that the ingredients in the food supply “have
been demonstrated to be safe” and “removing these safe ingredients does not
change the consumer packaged goods industry’s commitment to providing safe,
affordable and convenient product choices to consumers.”
Stacy Flathau, a co-chief corporate affairs officer at WK Kellogg, said in an emailed
statement that 85 percent of its cereals contained no artificial colors, but that it was
removing synthetic colors from those sold in schools. The company added that it
was looking forward to working with the F.D.A. to identify ways to remove artificial
colors from foods containing them.
Growing Colors From Scratch
Concerns about the safety of food colorings, especially regarding behavior in
children, have been on the rise. A 2021 health assessment by the State of California
suggested that “synthetic food dyes are associated with” behaviors “such as
inattentiveness, hyperactivity and restlessness in sensitive children.” In Europe,
food containing some dyes come with a warning label to that effect. Health Canada,
which allows the use of food dyes but with strict restrictions on the amounts, notes
on its website that it deems the evidence of those effects in children to be
insufficient.
California banned artificial dyes in school meals in 2024, and just last month, West
Virginia enacted a statewide ban, the most comprehensive in the country. More
states are considering restrictions.
Sensient had been building its portfolio of natural colors, assuming that, by 2030,
food companies will have moved away from synthetics. But the timeline could be
speeding up.

Sensient develops its natural colors starting with the seed. It has developed a
variety of beets, for instance, that are larger and more saturated in color, Mr.
Herrmann said. The company provides those seeds to contract farmers around the
world. After the produce is harvested, Sensient pulps, pulverizes and strains the
purple sweet potatoes, red radishes and grapes into a rainbow of extracts, powders
and liquids.
The process also eliminates the flavors of most of the underlying fruits, vegetables
or other plants, but not all.
“You’re never going to take the taste out of strawberry juice. It’s going to be a little
acidic, a little strawberry-ish. And that works well for a strawberry flavor in a kids’
cereal,” said Linsey Herman, a vice president of research and development at
Nature’s Path, which makes organic cereals and other foods. “But nobody is dying
for a carrot-flavored cereal.”
Even though the color, whether natural or synthetic, doesn’t often change the taste
profile of the frosted pastry or chip or soda, the appearance does signal certain
flavors — or intensity of flavors — to consumers, said Charles Spence, a professor
of food psychology at the University of Oxford.
“If you reduce the color saturation level of a drink, your mind may tell you it’s
going to taste less sweet or less sour than the original color,” Mr. Spence said.
“Duller hues may signal that this is a duller flavor or stale for some people, while
for others it may signal that it’s a more natural color, something found more in
nature.”
In recent years, Mr. Herrmann said, about 80 percent of new foods and beverages
hitting the market were being made with natural colors. But food companies have
dragged their feet on making the switch with popular existing products over fear
that consumers may spurn them.
“They have to understand what their die-hard fans want,” he said, “and make sure
the natural product reaches the synthetic shades as closely as possible.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/business/rfk-jr-food-dye-ban-

Alan Rappeport;Tony Romm,NYT,1,Business,4/25/2025,Trump Budget to Take Ax to ‘Radical’ Safety Net Programs,"The Trump administration, which has made clear that it aims to slash government
spending, is preparing to unveil a budget proposal as soon as next week that
includes draconian cuts that would entirely eliminate some federal programs and
fray the nation’s social safety net.
The proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year would cut billions of dollars from
programs that support child care, health research, education, housing assistance,
community development and the elderly, according to preliminary documents
reviewed by The New York Times. The proposal, which is being finalized by the
White House’s Office of Management and Budget, also targets longstanding
initiatives that have been prized by Democrats and that Republicans view as
“woke” or wasteful spending.
Technically, the president’s blueprint is merely a formal recommendation to
Congress, which must ultimately adopt any changes to spending. The full extent of
President Trump’s proposed cuts for 2026 is not yet clear. Rachel Cauley, a
spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget, said in a statement that
“no final funding decisions have been made.”
But early indications suggest the budget will aim to formalize Mr. Trump’s
disruptive reorganization of the federal government. That process — largely
overseen by the tech billionaire Elon Musk — has frozen billions of dollars in aid,
shuttered some programs and dismissed thousands of workers from their jobs,
prompting numerous court challenges.
The early blueprint reflects Mr. Trump’s long-held belief that some federal
antipoverty programs are unnecessary or rife with waste, fraud and abuse. And it
echoes many of the ideas espoused by his budget director, Russell T. Vought, a key
architect of Project 2025 who subscribes to the view that the president has
expansive powers to ignore Congress and cancel spending viewed as “woke and
weaponized.” He previously endorsed some of the cuts to housing, education and
other programs that Mr. Trump is expected to unveil in the coming days.
The White House is expected to release the budget as soon as next week, according
to two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to
describe the highly secretive process. The president is expected to couple his
blueprint for 2026 with a second measure — also set for release next week — that
would slash more than $9 billion in previously approved spending for the current
fiscal year, including money that funds PBS and NPR.
In total, the proposed cuts are likely to inform Republican lawmakers as they look
for ways to fund their economic agenda, including a package that would extend
and expand a set of tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump’s first term. Their ambitions
are projected to cost trillions of dollars, though Republican leaders have explored
whether to invoke a budget accounting trick to make it seem as though their tax
package does not add considerably to the federal debt.
In an interview with Time published on Friday, Mr. Trump suggested that he liked
the idea of making millionaires pay higher taxes to help offset tax cuts for others
but also said it would be politically untenable.
Some of the cuts the administration is envisioning could exacerbate the federal
deficit. The White House is looking to reduce about $2.5 billion from the budget of
the Internal Revenue Service with the goal of ending the Biden administration’s
“weaponization of I.R.S. enforcement,” which it said targeted conservatives and
small businesses. Budget scorekeepers have previously said that cuts to the I.R.S.
would reduce the amount of revenue coming into the government, since it would
make it harder for the tax collector to go after businesses and people who owe
money but do not pay.
In many cases, the draft budget slashes many federal antipoverty programs,
generally by cutting their funds and consolidating them into grants sent to the
states to manage. The full extent of those changes is not clear, but the result could
be fewer programs and dollars serving low-income Americans, who may be at risk
of losing some benefits.
Among the most prominent programs that could be eliminated is Head Start, which
provides early education and child care for some of the nation’s poorest children.
Documents reviewed by The Times show the White House is considering a $12.2
billion cut, which would wipe out the program. The budget document says Head
Start uses a “radical” curriculum and gives preference to illegal immigrants. A
description of the program also criticizes it for diversity, equity and inclusion
programming and the use of resources that encourage toddlers to welcome
children and families with different sexual orientations.
Despite the Trump administration’s pledge to make housing more affordable, the
budget draft would reduce funding for several programs that support housing
developments or provide rental assistance. The budget proposes saving $22 billion
by replacing the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s rental
assistance programs with a state-based initiative that would have a two-year cap
on rent subsidies for healthy adults.
The draft budget also eliminates the Home Investment Partnerships Program,
cutting the $1.25 billion fund that provides grants to states and cities for urban
development projects on the basis that it is “duplicative” of other federal housing
programs. It also cuts the $644 million housing block grant programs for Native
Americans and Native Hawaiians, saying that these would be unnecessary because
of new, unspecified initiatives such as enhanced “opportunity zones” that would
give states greater incentives to provide affordable housing.
The overhaul of the nation’s health research apparatus, a few years after the
coronavirus pandemic killed millions of people around the world, could also be
drastic, with about $40 billion in proposed cuts to the Department of Health and
Human Services.
The draft budget recommends cutting $8.8 billion from the National Institutes of
Health, which it declared has “broken the trust of the American people with
wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research and the promotion of
dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.”
The proposal would consolidate and shrink some of the agency’s core functions
that focus on chronic diseases and epidemics. It would entirely eliminate funding
for some divisions, such as the National Institute on Minority Health and Health
Disparities, which would lose the $534 million that it currently receives.
The budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be almost
halved, to $5.2 billion from $9.2 billion. Associated programs such as the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and Public Health Emergency
Preparedness and Response would be eliminated. A note in the preliminary
document refers to overdose prevention funding by the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration as the “Biden crack pipe.”
Although Mr. Trump has said he prioritizes “law and order” in his presidency, his
budget proposes about $2 billion of combined cuts to the F.B.I., the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives. The D.E.A. cuts would scale back international counternarcotics efforts
in European countries that are equipped to crack down on drug trafficking. The
A.T.F. cuts would eliminate offices at the agency that the Trump administration
says have “criminalized law-abiding gun ownership through regulatory fiat.”
The proposal said the goal was to invest in getting F.B.I. agents into the field and to
eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the bureau that were “pet
projects” of the Biden administration.
“Importantly, this administration is committed to undoing the weaponization of the
F.B.I. that pervaded during the previous administration, which included targeting
peaceful, pro-life protesters, concerned parents at school board meetings and
citizens opposed to radical transgender ideology,” said the note explaining the
proposed cuts.
As part of Mr. Trump’s “America First” approach, the budget draft calls for more
than $16 billion in combined cuts for economic and disaster support for Europe,
Eurasia and Central Asia, as well as humanitarian and refugee assistance and
U.S.A.I.D. operations.
“To ensure every tax dollar spent puts America First, all foreign assistance is
paused,” the draft budget document said. “To be clear, this is not a withdrawal from
the world.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/trump-budget-cuts.html
Alisha Haridasani Gupta,NYT,1,Business,4/25/2025,"With Khloud, Khloe Kardashian Will Release a Protein-Packed Popcorn","Cereal. Ice cream. Flavored sparkling water. A Snickers bar. Donuts and brownies.
Candy.
What sounds like the treats table at a child’s birthday party is, in fact, a list of
snacks that can now be found crammed with protein.
Next week, Khloé Kardashian, the reality TV star and entrepreneur, will add her
Khloud Protein Popcorn to the list. Her popcorn will come in three different
flavors: white Cheddar, olive oil and sea salt, and sweet and salty. It will contain 7
grams of protein per serving, derived from the popcorn’s “Khloud Dust,” which is a
blend of milk proteins and seasoning, according to a statement from Ms.
Kardashian’s company, Khloud Foods.
“I’ve always been a snacker and constantly on the lookout for options that are
convenient, healthy, and actually taste good,” Ms. Kardashian said in an emailed
statement. With Khloud, Ms. Kardashian added, she wanted to create a snack that
ticked those boxes and was “something I’d feel good sharing with family and
friends.”
Protein Is in Everything These Days. Even
Popcorn.
The introduction of Khloud Popcorn, which Ms. Kardashian announced on social
media this week, fits with a broader food trend. Experts call it the “proteinification”
of snacks, or desserts, or basically “everything,” said Jonathan Deutsch, a
professor of culinary arts and science at Drexel University and a trend spotter for
the Specialty Food Association, a national organization of food and beverage
businesses. The brands hope to cash in on growing consumer demand for protein,
which is driven largely by social media.
A trend report by Cargill, a company that sources and processes ingredients for
food manufacturers, showed that 61 percent of surveyed consumers noted that
they were hoping to increase their protein intake in 2024, up from 48 percent who
said so in 2019. Sixty-three percent of consumers reported that they were looking
for protein in their snacks in 2024.
The trend also stems from increased use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, like Ozempic
and Mounjaro, said Dr. Lisa Young, a nutrition consultant and adjunct professor of
nutrition at New York University. Those who use the weight-loss drugs report not
only a loss in appetite but also a loss of muscle mass, which means that they are
likely to try to pack as much protein as possible into the little that they do eat.
But, Dr. Young added, even people using GLP-1 drugs need only a fraction more
protein than the recommended amount for an adult, which is 0.8 grams of protein
per kilogram of body weight per day. People on the weight-loss drugs, and those
who do intense workouts, like weight training, are advised to shoot for 1.2 to 1.5
grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.
Protein-enriched snacks, she added, can also fall under the category of ultra-
processed foods, the consumption of which, she cautioned, can add to gut problems.
From a marketing perspective, Mr. Deutsch said, there are only three
macronutrients that the food industry can try to target in its new product lines: fat,
carbs and protein.
“They’re not going to have a ‘fat popcorn’ and they’re not going to have an ‘extra-
carb popcorn,’” he said. “That leaves one macronutrient, right?”
According to Mr. Deutsch, an apple or popcorn “as God made it,” or even just a
glass of water, could be seen as the ideal snacks for most people because, “when
you walk around civil society, you’re not stumbling over people with protein
deficiencies.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/style/khloe-kardashian-protein-

Stanley Reed,NYT,1,Business,4/27/2025,Trump’s Tariffs Squeeze an Already Struggling British Car Industry,"The 25 percent tariffs imposed by President Trump on imported cars have added to
the pressures on vehicle manufacturers around the world, but the pain could be
particularly acute in Britain’s venerable but flagging auto industry.
Britain exports more than 70 percent of the cars that it makes. In 2024, it sent
about 101,000 of those vehicles — about 17 percent of car exports, worth 7.6 billion
pounds (about $10.1 billion) — to the United States, according to the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders, an industry group. Tariffs now threaten to close
what had been one of Britain’s largest markets.
Over the decades, Britain has built a reputation for producing innovative and iconic
vehicles like the Land Rover Defender and the Morris Minor, which helped make
car ownership affordable as the country emerged from World War II.

In recent years, though, the auto industry has struggled to keep pace as it
navigates obstacles including the global shift to electric vehicles and Britain’s exit
from its main export market, the European Union.
The annual number of cars made in Britain has fallen nearly 50 percent since the
end of the last decade, to about 770,000. It now imports far more cars than it
makes.
Given the Trump administration’s rapid policy swings, it is impossible for auto
industry executives to know what level of tariffs will stick. But Washington’s moves
are already bad news for some of Britain’s carmakers, which view the United
States as a crucial growth market.
“This is about a very unsettling move for U.K. manufacturing,” said Peter Wells, a
car expert at Cardiff University in Wales.

in 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters
Mr. Wells said companies would most likely be forced to alter their plans, like
production runs and shipping. “So already it’s costing money to try and deal with
the volatility,” he said.
JLR, the maker of Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles, said it would suspend
shipments to the United States for April. The company, which is owned by India’s
Tata Motors, is one of the largest vehicle manufacturers in Britain, but 28 percent
of its sales over the last year were in North America, where it does not make cars.

Any long-term changes in the United States are likely to have large implications for
Britain’s automakers. The United States last year shipped only 18,000 vehicles to
Britain, which imposes a 10 percent tariff on U.S. imports.
Some European models from American automakers do well in Britain. The Ford
Puma, which is made in Romania in a joint venture, has recently been the top-
selling model in Britain.
British car manufacturing is now dominated by a small group of international
companies, including Nissan, which operates a large plant at Sunderland; BMW,
which makes the Mini; and Toyota.

To keep attracting investment, especially in new electric models, these plants need
to be able to compete with rivals around the planet. Executives and analysts say
the industry faces a raft of challenges, including high energy costs and stress on
the network of suppliers of parts and services after Brexit.

said he expected the market for high-priced brands like JLR “to carry on to be quite
strong.” Sjoerd van der Wal/Getty Images
“Ultimately, the U.K. is not a competitive place to be building cars today,” Alan
Johnson, Nissan’s senior vice president for manufacturing in the region, told a
parliamentary hearing last week.
Stuart Bradley, principal engineer at Warwick Manufacturing Group, a part of the
University of Warwick, said he thought that high-priced brands from carmakers
like JLR or Rolls-Royce Motor Cars might have a brighter future in Britain than
what he called “commodity” producers.
“I think the high-value market is going to carry on to be quite strong,” he said.
The unions that represent the estimated 200,000 workers in auto manufacturing in
Britain worry that the tariffs are just the latest in a series of blows that could lead
to job losses or even plant closings.
Some manufacturers have closed British plants in recent years. In 2021, for
instance, Honda shut down a plant at Swindon that employed 3,500 people.
Unite, a trade union that represents around 70,000 autoworkers, estimates that the
British car industry is operating at just over half capacity, probably sapping the
profitability that comes from spreading costs over large volumes.
“It’s not sustainable,” said Des Quinn, Unite’s national officer for automotive. “The
whole sector is in crisis.”
Much depends on the difficult transition to electric vehicles. The industry says it is
being squeezed by the British government’s requirement to phase out sales of the
bulk of gasoline- and diesel-powered cars by 2030.
Britain had made rapid advances in increasing its electric car fleet. Britain led
Europe, for instance, in sales of electric cars last year, according to the British
government.

bulk of gasoline- and diesel-powered cars by 2030. Chris Jackson Collection, via Getty Images
Critics, though, say strict government-imposed quotas for electric vehicle sales
have encouraged imports of electric vehicles like Teslas, which are made in
Germany or China, at the expense of the domestic industry. Chinese automakers
like BYD are also making inroads.
The question is whether the British-based makers can catch up in the coming years
— especially in the production of smaller, cheaper electric cars for ordinary
consumers.
“I’m not entirely confident that all of the industry will come through unscathed,”
Mr. Wells said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/business/trump-tariffs-uk-cars.html
Colby Smith,NYT,1,Business,4/26/2025,Bessent Seeks to Reassure Global Leaders on Dollar’s Role as Safe Haven,"On the sidelines of the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to convey an
important message about the United States dollar.
Speaking to a crowd of global policymakers, regulators and investors, Mr. Bessent
sought to allay fears that had ballooned in recent weeks about the dollar’s global
standing and the country’s role as the safest haven during times of stress. He
reiterated that the administration would continue to have a “strong-dollar policy”
and affirmed that it would remain the currency that the rest of the world wanted to
hold, even though it had weakened against most major currencies.
For participants at the event, Mr. Bessent’s comments were a needed salve after a
bruising couple of weeks in financial markets as a result of President Trump’s trade
war. Violent swings in stocks, coinciding with the weakening of the dollar as
investors fled U.S. government bonds, had incited panic.
Dollar Doubts Dominate
Gathering of Global
Economic Leaders
The fact that Mr. Bessent found it necessary to emphasize that message in front of
such a big crowd underscored how precarious the situation had become since Mr.
Trump returned to the White House less than 100 days ago. What now looms large
are uncomfortable questions about what happens if the international community
starts to lose faith in the dollar and other U.S. assets, something that economists
warn would be costly for Americans.
“People are playing through scenarios that previously had been judged
unthinkable, and they’re playing them through in a very serious kind of way in the
spirit of contingency planning,” said Nathan Sheets, the chief economist at
Citigroup and a Treasury official in the Obama administration.
“If the United States is going to pursue aggressive economic policies, it’s natural
for the rest of the world to step back and say, ‘Well, do we want to buy U.S. assets
as we have in the past?’”
‘New World Order’
At a similar gathering hosted by the I.M.F. and World Bank six months ago,
attendees were preparing for an entirely different economic backdrop. Convening
less than two weeks before the presidential election, they still had in their sights a
rare soft landing in which the major central banks finished their fight against high
inflation while managing to avoid a recession.

The tariffs Mr. Trump had been talking about on the campaign trail were top of
mind, but for the most part, they were viewed as a negotiating tactic. Any turn
toward protectionism was widely expected to push up the value of the dollar
compared with other currencies. The rationale was that tariffs would lower
demand for imported goods, since they would make them more expensive for
American consumers, and over time result in fewer dollars being exchanged for
foreign currencies.
But since Inauguration Day, the opposite has occurred. An index that tracks the
dollar against a basket of major trading partners has fallen nearly 10 percent in the
last three months. It now hovers near a three-year low. The sharpest slide came
after Mr. Trump announced large tariffs on nearly all imports in April. While he
temporarily reversed course, the dollar has yet to recoup its losses.
There are reasons not to read too much into its recent weakening. The U.S.
economic outlook has fundamentally changed. Businesses are “frozen” by tariffs,
Christopher J. Waller, a governor at the Federal Reserve, said this week as he
warned about layoffs stemming from the uncertainty.
Economists have sharply scaled back their estimates for growth while raising their
estimates for inflation, a combination that carries a whiff of stagflation. In that
environment, it is not surprising that the dollar and other U.S. assets appear less
appealing.
Dollar depreciation — even if extreme — also does not necessarily translate to a
loss of stature in the global financial system. There have been previous big drops in
the value of the dollar that have not incited a wholesale shift away from the
currency’s primacy, said Jonas Goltermann, the deputy chief markets economist at
Capital Economics.
Earlier entries about North American tariffs
But at this year’s spring meetings, there was a palpable sense that something more
ominous could be taking place. Joyce Chang, JPMorgan’s chair of global research,
noted a disconnect between domestic and international participants at the
conference that the Wall Street bank hosted during the week of the meetings.
U.S.-based investors appeared less concerned about a structural shift away from
the country’s assets and more focused on the ways in which Mr. Trump could
course-correct on his economic policies. International investors were consumed by
the prospects of a “regime change” in the financial system and a “new world order,”
Ms. Chang said.
Mr. Trump had recently escalated his attacks on Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair,
fanning fears about how much the administration would encroach on the central
bank’s independence. That longstanding separation from the White House is
broadly seen as essential to the smooth functioning of the financial system.
“The dollar’s role in the system was not ordained from above,” said Mark Sobel, a
former Treasury official who is the U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and
Financial Institutions Forum. “It’s a reflection of the properties of the United
States.”
Those include a large economy that transacts with the world; the financial
system’s deepest, most liquid capital markets; a credible central bank; and the rule
of law.
“I do believe that Trump is doing permanent damage,” Mr. Sobel said.
Few Alternatives
It is hard to overstate the dominance of the dollar globally, meaning there are real
limitations to how significantly private and public investors can diversify away
from it, even if they want to.
Most trade is invoiced in dollars. It is the leading currency for international
borrowing. Central banks also prefer to hold dollar assets more than anything else,
and by a wide margin.
“Anybody who’s looking for diversification has to be realistic,” said Isabelle Mateos
y Lago, the chief economist at BNP Paribas. “Reserve assets, by definition, have to
be liquid.”
Alternatives do exist, but they are hobbled by their own weaknesses. China lacks
open, deep and liquid capital markets, and its currency does not float freely,
tarnishing its appeal globally. Top European leaders — including Christine
Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank — have talked more readily
about bolstering the prominence of the euro, something that is considered more
plausible now that countries like Germany are stepping up their spending. But the
amount of available euro-denominated safe assets pales in comparison with that of
U.S. capital markets.
Still, in the recent period of volatility, investors have found a number of places to
take cover. The euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen have been clear beneficiaries.
Gold has rallied sharply, too.
“You don’t need to have the role of the dollar as a reserve asset go to zero,” said Ms.
Mateos y Lago. “A multipolar system can totally work.”
Burden or Privilege?
When asked at Wednesday’s event, which was hosted by the Institute for
International Finance, whether the dollar’s reserve currency status was a burden
or a privilege, Mr. Bessent said: “I actually am not sure that anyone else wants it.”
But economists warn that Americans would be losing clear benefits if the
government was too cavalier about the dollar’s shedding its special status.
The country’s exporters would reap rewards, as a weaker dollar would make their
products more competitive. However, that advantage could come at the expense of
reduced spending power for Americans abroad and higher borrowing costs at a
time when the government has huge financing needs.
Despite the pain that Americans may have to bear, the global financial system
would be far more “resilient” if other currencies shared the dollar’s global role over
time, said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California,
Berkeley. During times of stress, that would mean multiple sources of liquidity.
However, three months into Mr. Trump’s second term, Mr. Eichengreen warned
that a “dire scenario is now on the table” — a sharp sell-off of dollar-denominated
assets into cash.
“A chaotic rush out of the dollar would be a crisis,” he said. “All of a sudden, the
world would not have the international liquidity that 21st-century globalization
depends on.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/26/business/dollar-trump-bessent.html
Elian Peltier,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,How Pope Francis Challenged and Embraced Africa’s Rising Catholic Population,"When Pope Francis presided over a Mass that incorporated elements of Congolese
tradition in St. Peter’s Basilica in 2019, it was seen as a sign of his enduring
commitment to Roman Catholics across Africa.
When he visited African migrants in southern Italy and later kissed the feet of
South Sudan’s two competing warlords, his actions drew more attention to his
focus on a continent where the number of Catholics is growing faster than
anywhere else in the world.
“Being from Latin America, he felt for our predicaments as a third-world continent
struggling in a world controlled from far away,” said Cardinal John Onaiyekan, the
former archbishop of Abuja, Nigeria, who voted in the 2013 conclave that elected
Francis.
Could the Next Pope Be From Africa?

of Congo? Sign up for Your Places: Global Update, and we’ll send our
latest coverage to your inbox.
As Cardinal Onaiyekan and his peers prepare to meet in the Sistine Chapel next
week to elect the new pope after Francis’ death, the question of how Africa’s rising
Catholic population might shape the next papacy and the church’s future has
become more timely than ever.
About a fifth of Africa’s population, roughly 280 million people, are Catholic. Nearly
a fifth of all Catholics are Africans, and that balance is changing: According to the
Vatican, more than half of the 13 million people who joined the church in 2022 were
in Africa.
Mourning Pope Francis in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo, last week. Francis visited the country in

Africa produces the highest number of seminarians in the world. Of the 135
cardinals who will name the next pope, 18 are from Africa.
Francis’ legacy in Africa is mixed, with some crediting him for adapting church
teachings to African customs and others saying his messages at times felt out of
touch with the diverse and strongly held beliefs that animate many African
societies.
On same-sex marriage and divorce, Francis’ blessing of same-sex couples faced a
strong rebuke from African bishops and many Catholics in countries where
homosexuality remains criminalized, stigmatized or taboo. The resistance from
African bishops highlighted their growing influence within the church, observers
say.
“Pope Francis had a certain solidarity with Africa, and I think his teachings on
social issues were appreciated,” said Father Giulio Albanese, an Italian missionary
who worked in Uganda in the 1980s and accompanied Francis on two trips to
Africa. “But sometimes the openness of the people is not accepted by the bishops.”
Francis visited 10 African countries over five trips throughout his 12-year papacy,
while his predecessor visited the continent twice.
Among Francis’ potential successors from Africa is Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, the
65-year-old archbishop of Kinshasa, whom Francis made a cardinal in 2019, who
was a member of his Council of Cardinals and who led the opposition to the
Vatican’s declaration allowing the church to bless homosexual couples.
That opposition essentially forced Francis to let African bishops ignore the policy.

Congo Cathedral in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. Hardy Bope/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images
Other African contenders include Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, who was a
candidate in the 2013 conclave and holds views similar to Francis’ on climate
change, social justice and homosexuality.
On the other end of the spectrum is Cardinal Robert Sarah of Guinea, who was a
leading opponent of Francis and his attempts to modernize the church.
The election of an African pope would most likely usher in an era of conservatism,
in line with the traditional views of many African Catholics.
On many topics, however, African Catholics said Francis had preached values close
to their hearts, including a more respectful relationship to nature, interreligious
dialogue with Islam and the importance of incorporating local traditions into one’s
faith.
Even on homosexuality, many said Francis’ approach was one of subtlety that
resonated in Africa and made the church’s doctrine more appealing on a continent
with the world’s highest share of young people.
“Pope Francis’ stance on homosexuals was one of both reaffirming traditional
Catholic teaching while also advocating for greater inclusivity and respect,” said
Brian Mboh, 28, who is Catholic and a communications professional from
Cameroon, where homosexuality is criminalized.

During a private audience with the pope in 2023, Sheila Leocádia Pires, a
communications officer for the Southern African Catholic Bishops’ Conference, said
she raised the issue of single mothers’ being deprived of the Eucharist in Africa.
“All are welcome,” was his answer, said Ms. Pires.
For all of Francis’ attention to Africa, Catholics there noted that his influence and
calls for peace yielded few results.
The war in the Democratic Republic of Congo entered a new deadly phase this
year. African migrants still face deadly obstacles in the perilous journey to Europe.
The two competing leaders of South Sudan are threatening a new war.
“They forgot how he knelt down and kissed their feet since they’re at each other’s
throats again,” said Cardinal Onaiyekan.
Others said the care and attention Francis gave to Africa would be what they
remembered about him most.
“Our country was at war but he still came here to share our suffering,” said
Eugenie Ndumba, a parish lecturer in Congo, which Francis visited in 2023.
“He knew where his children were, and he made sure he went toward them.”

Ana Swanson;Jack Ewing,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,Trump Signs Executive Order Walking Back Some Auto Tariffs,"President Trump signed a pair of executive orders on Tuesday that walked back
some tariffs for carmakers, removing levies that Ford, General Motors and others
have complained would backfire on U.S. manufacturing by raising the cost of
production and squeezing their profits.
The changes will modify Mr. Trump’s tariffs so carmakers that pay a 25 percent
tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, for example on steel and
aluminum, or on certain imports from Canada and Mexico, according to the orders.
However, the rules do not appear to protect automakers from tariffs on steel and
aluminum that their suppliers pay and pass on.
Carmakers will also be able to qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of the cost of
their imported components, though those benefits will be phased out over the next
two years.
At a rally in Michigan on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said that he was showing “a
little flexibility” to the automakers but that he wanted them to make their
components in the United States.
Trump Grants Carmakers Some Relief From His
Punishing Tariffs
“We gave them a little time before we slaughter them if they don’t do this,” he said.
The decision to reduce the scope of the tariffs is the latest sign that the Trump
administration’s decision to impose stiff levies on nearly all trading partners has
created challenges and economic uncertainty for American companies. But even
with the concessions announced Tuesday, administration policies will add
thousands of dollars to car prices and endanger the financial health of automakers
and their suppliers, analysts said.
Mr. Trump signed the executive orders aboard Air Force One as he flew to
Michigan, home to America’s largest automakers, for a speech marking his 100
days in office.
Automakers have welcomed any relaxation of tariffs, which they said would raise
car prices, cause sales to fall and threaten their financial viability. But the steps will
leave in place a 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles that took effect April 3, and a
tariff on auto parts that will take effect on Saturday. That will still raise prices for
new and used cars by thousands of dollars and increase the cost of repairs and
insurance premiums.
On Tuesday, General Motors abandoned a previous forecast for solid profit growth
this year as a result of the uncertainty created by Mr. Trump’s trade policies. The
carmaker, which sells more vehicles in the United States than any other company,
said any profit prediction would be a “guess.”
“The prior guidance cannot be relied upon,” Paul Jacobson, G.M.’s chief financial
officer, said during a conference call with reporters.
The automaker also postponed a conference call with financial analysts to discuss
its first-quarter results, citing the Trump administration’s expected change to tariff
policy. The company will now hold the call on Thursday.

See every major action by the Trump administration ›
The move comes just weeks after the administration exempted smartphones,
computers, semiconductors and other electronics from its punishing China tariffs
over concerns from companies like Apple that the import taxes would cause prices
for U.S. consumers to skyrocket.
On Tuesday, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, said that the changes
stemmed from direct conversations with domestic automakers, and that the
administration had been in “constant contact” with the companies to analyze their
business and make sure they got the policy exactly right.
“Donald Trump and his presidency are going to bring domestic auto manufacturing
back,” Mr. Lutnick said.
The Trump administration has not admitted that the tariffs will hurt U.S.
automakers. But on Tuesday it seemed to acknowledge that rolling back the tariffs
would help them. In one order signed on Tuesday, the president said the changes
would help reduce the industry’s reliance on foreign manufacturing and encourage
companies to expand their domestic production.
For one year, the administration will offer automakers an exemption from its auto
parts tariffs for 15 percent of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price of an
automobile assembled in the United States. That would drop to 10 percent in the
second year, and then be eliminated in the third year.

Ana Swanson
Times reporter covering the Trump tariffs
“I have been reporting on economics, trade and international relations for over a
decade, from both China and the U.S. I aim to underpin my work with data and
numbers, as well as give voice to the personal stories of people I encounter in my
reporting.”
Here’s our latest reporting on economic policy and tariffs.
Automakers that assemble cars in the United States will be able to apply for this
so-called offset by submitting documentation to the government about their
projected imports and tariff costs.
In a second executive order, Mr. Trump detailed new rules that will exempt
companies that pay one kind of tariff from paying others. The president said that
when one import was subject to multiple kinds of tariffs, the tariffs should not
“‘stack’ on top of one another” because the resulting tariffs were higher than
necessary.
The order said carmakers paying a 25 percent tariff to bring in cars and car parts
would not be subject to tariffs that Mr. Trump had placed on steel and aluminum or
on imports from Canada and Mexico.
Products that are subject to the tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico will no
longer be subject to tariffs on steel and aluminum, the order said. But it said goods
that were charged tariffs on their steel content would still be charged tariffs on any
aluminum content.
Other duties will still be charged on all of the items, including the tariffs that Mr.
Trump has imposed on China and tariffs imposed for trade violations, like dumping
and unfair subsidization.
The latest rules also leave in place an exemption for parts imported from Canada
and Mexico that comply with a treaty that Mr. Trump negotiated during his first
term. Both countries are major suppliers to the U.S. auto industry.
The exemption buys carmakers some time, said Lenny LaRocca, U.S. automotive
industry leader at the consulting firm KPMG. “It gives them a little bit of time to
plan out what their strategy could be,” he said.
But automakers and suppliers say two years is not enough time for them to
reorganize their manufacturing operations. Even if they do, they will not be able to
make many components as cheaply in the United States as they do elsewhere,
which will lead to higher prices.
Even cars manufactured in the United States typically use far more imported parts
than would be covered by an exemption. Most cars also contain components from
Japan, South Korea or China that will be subject to tariffs.
“Relief today doesn’t fix the longer-term challenge,” analysts at Bernstein said in a
note Tuesday. “U.S. car prices are heading higher just as economic momentum
fades.”
Nevertheless, auto executives expressed gratitude that Mr. Trump had addressed
at least some of their concerns. In a statement on Monday, Mary T. Barra, the chief
executive of G.M., said the company appreciated “productive conversations with
the president and his administration.”
“The president’s leadership is helping level the playing field for companies like
G.M. and allowing us to invest even more in the U.S. economy,” she said.
“Stellantis appreciates the tariff relief measures decided by President Trump,”
John Elkann, chairman of the company that owns Dodge, Jeep, Ram and Chrysler,
said in a statement. “While we further assess the impact of the tariff policies on our
North American operations, we look forward to our continued collaboration with
the U.S. administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and
stimulate exports.”
The executives also hinted that they hoped continued talks with administration
officials would lead to further concessions. “We will continue to work closely with
the administration in support of the president’s vision for a healthy and growing
auto industry in America,” Jim Farley, the chief executive of Ford, said in a
statement.
The exemption appears to have been engineered in part by Mr. Lutnick, who has
played a role in securing lucrative exemptions for some industries in recent
months. In a statement on Monday, he called the deal “a major victory for the
president’s trade policy” and said it would provide “runway to manufacturers who
have expressed their commitment to invest in America.”
Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow with the Mercatus Center, called the
move a “shakedown” by the Trump administration, saying it had imposed pain on
automakers and then demanded promises of investments from them.
“The Trump tariffs created a crisis for automakers, and now the administration is
offering partial relief,” she said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-auto-tariffs-executive-order.html
Damien Cave,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,Ho Chi Minh City Celebrates the Fall of Saigon With a Parade,"Vietnam marked the 50th anniversary of the end of what it calls the American War
on Wednesday with a boisterous parade in Ho Chi Minh City featuring soldiers,
dancers and speeches celebrating what the country’s communist leader called “a
triumph of justice.”
The event brought tens if not hundreds of thousands, according to state media,
including many who camped out overnight for the morning’s festivities.
“The atmosphere was very special,” said Nguyen Thi Song Anh, 18, who joined
some 12th-grade classmates on a crowded sidewalk near the Opera House. “It was
important for me to feel part of this country — and part of this history.”
The scenes of celebration, with a sea of red and yellow representing the flag of
Vietnam in front of high-end French and American retailers, pointed to just how
distant the final day of this country’s grueling war has become.

Ho Chi Minh City, also still known as Saigon, is now a vibrant metropolis of 9
million people, where skyscrapers shadow the handful of buildings with wartime
history and the streets are filled with locally made electric vehicles and young
people snapping selfies for Instagram.
To Lam, the top leader of the Communist Party of Vietnam, acknowledged a need for greater

On most days, people will tell you the war is irrelevant, too old for concern, except
perhaps as a source of gritty stories that drive the young to be grateful for what
they have.
But April 30 is different.
Every year, Vietnam honors the dead and recounts how the underdogs of the North
definitively defeated the French, the Americans and ultimately South Vietnam.
On Wednesday, To Lam, the top leader of the Communist Party of Vietnam, struck
many of the usual chords in a speech before international visitors, which did not
include the U.S. ambassador.
But the U.S. Consul General, Susan Burns, was there — a softening of an earlier
directive from Washington barring senior diplomats from anniversary events.
Mr. Lam described the conflict as a struggle for national independence and a
resistance movement against French colonialism and U.S. aggression. He
celebrated “the liberation of the South,” which Washington has generally referred
to as “the fall of Saigon.”


Vietnam also included troops from China in Wednesday’s parade for the first time,
providing public recognition of Beijing’s assistance during the war. However it was
not a huge surprise: A video of Chinese troops at a rehearsal singing the popular
patriotic song, “As If Uncle Ho Were With Us on the Day of Great Victory” had
already been shared widely on social media.
Still, there were also hints of a more conciliatory approach to past enemies. Even
as Vietnam grits its teeth in negotiations with the White House over proposed
tariffs set (and postponed) at 46 percent, Mr. Lam noted that 2025 is also when the
U.S. and Vietnam celebrate 30 years of diplomatic ties.
Reaffirming an essay he published Sunday, acknowledging a need for greater
reconciliation between North and South, he also spoke about “respecting
differences.”
“All Vietnamese are sons and daughters of this country,” he said. “All are entitled to
live, to work, to pursue happiness and love.”
The parade brought together many international visitors. The U.S. ambassador did not attend, but the

The parade featured soldiers, dancers and speeches celebrating what Mr. Lam called “a triumph of

Ms. Song Anh, the 12th-grader, like many others on the parade route, found the
message compelling. Her grandfathers had fought for the North, but she said it
was time to “overcome our biases.”
“We are all Vietnamese,” she said. “We all carry a sense of pride.”
On Wednesday, it was on full display. Billboards juxtaposed Ho Chi Minh’s gaze
with images of new bridges, connecting past struggles to modern development.
Families sang patriotic songs. The young and hip snapped photos of helicopters
flying over Independence Palace, the seat of the South’s government, which
northern troops seized on April 30, 1975.
Asked if there was anything they would change, a few parade-goers spoke about
the need to eliminate corruption, to create an economy that served all more
equally.
But many also pointed with admiration to new buildings that would have been
unimaginable in the 1970s and ’80s, when the war-wrecked economy was on its
knees.
“It’s so emotional, to see all the development and changes happening in Vietnam,”
said Tran Quang Duc, 67, who had traveled from the province that Ho Chi Minh was
from and wore his military uniform on Wednesday.
“I don’t think anyone would want to fight Vietnam now,” he added, noting that he
fought the Chinese in the war that broke out in 1979. “We’re strong and confident.”
We met beside the Rex hotel, where the U.S. military used to hold its briefings,
claiming the war was being won. Reporters called them the “five o’clock follies.”


A statue of Ho Chi Minh now stands nearby. Vu Thi Ninh Thuy, 42, gathered there
after the parade to take pictures with a few friends. She said she had come out
early that morning because the 50th anniversary was a singular event.
“I wanted to be part of it,” she said. “I wanted to feel what it was like to live in
historic times.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/asia/saigon-parade-vietnam-

Jack Nicas,NYT,1,World,4/17/2025,Hundreds of Capybaras ‘Conquered’ This Town. Now What?,"Luciano Sampietro lifted a three-foot aluminum pipe to his lips and blew, sending a
blow dart laced with sedatives, muscle relaxers and painkillers toward the world’s
largest rodent, lounging near an artificial pond.
The veterinarian’s target, a roughly 110-pound alpha male capybara, was hit in the
hind leg. Mr. Sampietro fired again and struck a female. Within 15 minutes, workers
dressed in the tan outfits of safari guides scooped up the sleeping patients.
But they were too late: The female was already pregnant. So they injected the male
with a drug designed to stop him from impregnating any more.
Yes, in the wealthy suburbs of Buenos Aires, they are sterilizing the capybaras.
The world’s largest rodent is multiplying in — and dividing — one of Argentina’s most
exclusive gated communities.

The rotund, laid-back, dog-sized rodents native to South America have recently
become a darling of the modern internet. They have catapulted to the top of the
unofficial adorable animal rankings via countless videos showing them mellow,
plump and perfectly happy to let monkeys and ducks ride on their backs. Their
image adorns backpacks and stuffed animals, and in Tokyo, tourists pay premiums
to feed them carrots at capybara cafes.
But to some people in one corner of their native land, the cuddly capybara has
become a menace.
Since the pandemic, “carpinchos,” as they are known in Argentina, have
proliferated in Nordelta, a ritzy, picturesque gated community of 45,000 people
north of Buenos Aires. When residents retreated indoors in 2020, the capybaras
began to colonize the manicured neighborhoods, finding green grass, fresh water
and no predators, according to biologists hired by the community.
Over the past two years, the biologists estimate Nordelta’s capybara population
has tripled to nearly 1,000, posing a tricky test case for the urban coexistence of
humans and wildlife.
On a visit last month, capybara families grazed near the tennis courts, dozed on the
volleyball courts and waded in the artificial lagoons. Just past a sign warning of
crossing capybaras, a family crossed the street in a single-file line, illuminated by
waiting headlights.
Sure, most residents admitted, the capybaras are cute. But they also cause traffic
accidents, chomp their way through gardens and, on occasion, have attacked some
of the community’s smallest dogs.
“It’s a wild animal versus a domesticated dog. I mean, it’s totally different,” said Mr.
Sampietro, the veterinarian hired to help manage the capybara population. “I’ve
had to do necropsies on capybaras and it’s difficult to cut the hide with a knife.”

Pablo Pefaure, one of Nordelta’s 26 neighborhood representatives, said his
neighbors frequently complain to him about the amphibious rodents. “They see
them as dangerous, they see them as invasive, they fear for their young children,”
he said.
He said that capybaras have sometimes followed his miniature schnauzer,
Grumete. “I don’t leave him alone in the garden because I don’t know what might
happen,” he said.
His neighbor sitting nearby, Veronica Esposito, did not agree. “No capybara has
ever approached my dogs,” she said. “Everyone says they eat the plants. Yes, they
do. But the plants grow back,” she added. “I don’t see the problem.”
Ms. Esposito is one of a small group of neighbors leading a rebellion against the
capybara controls. They have protested in the streets, taken legal action against
developers and gathered 25,000 signatures for an online petition to protect the
animals. They’ve also attracted 34,000 followers to an Instagram page where they
sometimes shame their neighbors, including one who had used a whip to scare
capybaras off her dock.
“I believe their adorableness is a strategy of the species itself to survive,” said
Silvia Soto, the most vocal neighbor. “Their lovability has conquered us, and we’re
fighting for them.”

So far, the fight has not worked. Last year, Argentina’s national government began
an experiment to perform vasectomies on three capybaras in Nordelta, hoping to
track how it affected the males’ standing in their packs. If successful, the practice
could be expanded.
In February, the Nordelta organization told residents in an email that it was
moving ahead with a different plan: a “contraceptive vaccination program,”
approved by the local government, to sterilize 250 adult capybaras.
Costanza Falguera, the organization’s lead biologist, said her team is using a
“vaccine” that halts the production of sperm and inhibits ovulation. It requires two
injections several months apart, but then might last only for several months,
meaning they might have to keep tranquilizing the capybaras repeatedly.
They aren’t sure how long the sterilization lasts because the drug — Improvac,
made by a New Jersey drug maker, Zoetis — has not been used on capybaras. It is
designed to alter pigs’ hormones before slaughter so the meat tastes better. “Only
for use in male pigs,” Zoetis says on its disclaimer for the drug.
In 2019, Nordelta sprayed its grass with the scent of a carnivore, scaring off many
capybara. But Ms. Falguera said the efficacy dropped over time as the capybara in
Nordelta became long removed from having regular predators.

Thirty years ago, Nordelta was largely untouched wetlands where capybaras roamed freely. It has since
become home to some of Argentina’s richest people.
So, she said, the community settled on the injections, which she said are better than
castration or vasectomies because they are less likely to alter the rodents’ behavior
and group dynamics.
In other words, they still mate, she said, “but they don’t fertilize.”
The decision to sterilize the capybaras ultimately rested with one of Argentina’s
richest men, Eduardo Constantini, an entrepreneur and real estate developer
whose company controls the Nordelta organization. His spokeswoman did not
respond to requests for comment.
To the capybara advocates, intervening in the animals’ reproduction is an
escalation of Nordelta’s attack on the species.
Thirty years ago, Nordelta was largely untouched wetlands where capybaras
roamed freely, hunted by pumas, jaguars, caiman and sport hunters. In the late
1990s, Mr. Constantini began transforming the area with roads, ponds, mansions,
condo towers, a shopping center and a golf course designed by the American golfer
Jack Nicklaus. Construction has been nearly nonstop — with 17 more buildings
underway now — and it is now home to some of Argentina’s richest people.

Ms. Soto argued that the capybara population is only increasing because
developers destroyed the animals’ wild habitat, forcing them out of the forest and
into the suburbs.
“In a matter of hours they knock down a forest,” Ms. Soto said. “What happened to
the wildlife? Have they died? Have they been displaced?”
Her group is pushing for the capybara to be given their own nature reserve, but
there appears to be little interest from Nordelta’s developers. “I don’t understand
how they can only think of vasectomy and sterilization,” she said.

On a recent weekday, as capybara grazed on a playground, Lidia Schmidt and
Felipo Contigiani walked past, hardly noticing. The married couple agreed the
capybara population had to be checked somehow, but they did not see eye to eye on
the causes of the problem.
Mr. Contigiani, who said that he used to hunt capybara as a child, had less
sympathy for the animals. “It’s a wild animal that came to live in the city,” he said.
His wife corrected him. “No, the city came to settle where the wild animal was,” she
said. “It’s the other way around.”

Karen Zraick,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,"Man Accused of Hacking Climate Groups Can Be Sent to U.S., Judge Says","An English court on Wednesday approved the extradition of an Israeli man
charged by New York prosecutors with running a “hacking-for-hire” operation that
targeted environmental groups.
Prosecutors say that companies run by the man, Amit Forlit, 57, earned at least $16
million by hacking more than 100 victims and stealing confidential information on
behalf of a lobbying firm working for a major oil company.
Lawyers for Mr. Forlit identified the company as ExxonMobil in a January court
filing. Exxon has been sued by Democratic attorneys general and other local
officials over its role in climate change. The lawsuits claim the company covered up
what it knew about climate change for decades to continue selling oil. The lobbying
firm was identified in the filing as DCI Group.
An Exxon statement said the company had not been involved in and was not aware
of any hacking. “If there was any hacking involved, we condemn it in the strongest
possible terms,” the statement said.
A spokesman for DCI, Craig Stevens, said the firm instructs employees and
consultants to comply with the law and that no one at DCI had directed or was
involved “in any hacking alleged to have occurred a decade ago.”
DCI also said that “radical anti-oil activists and their billionaire donors, many of
whom still sleep on beds paid for by their family’s fossil-energy legacy trust funds,
peddle conspiracy theories” about the firm.
That was an apparent reference to the role of the Rockefeller family in supporting
organizations advocating for climate-change litigation. Heirs of John D. Rockefeller,
who made his fortune in oil more than a century ago, today lead a foundation, the
Rockefeller Family Fund, that plays a key role in the movement to sue oil
companies over climate change. Lee Wasserman, its director, has said he was
targeted by the hacking campaign.
Mr. Forlit was arrested in London last year following a grand jury indictment in
New York on charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and
conspiracy to commit computer hacking, which could carry a lengthy sentence. His
lawyers had argued that he should not be extradited because he would not receive
a fair trial in the United States because of the political firestorm over climate
change litigation.
They argued that “one of the reasons underpinning the prosecution is to advance
the politically motivated cause of pursuing ExxonMobil, with Mr. Forlit a form of
collateral damage.”
His lawyers also argued that Mr. Forlit would be in danger at the Metropolitan
Detention Center, the only federal jail in New York, which has been plagued by
violence and dysfunction. High-profile defendants recently held there have
included Luigi Mangione, Sam Bankman-Fried and Sean Combs, also known as
Puff Daddy and Diddy.
The Westminster Magistrates’ Court rejected those concerns. Mr. Forlit can appeal
the decision. His lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
One of the groups targeted was the Union of Concerned Scientists, which has long
researched the fossil fuel industry’s role in what it calls climate science
disinformation. The group also does source-attribution science, the practice of
using data to estimate the contributions made by specific corporations to the
effects of global warming, like sea level rise or wildfires. Its work has been cited in
lawsuits against the oil industry.
The organization learned of the hacking from a 2020 report by Citizen Lab, a
cybersecurity watchdog group at the University of Toronto, according to Kathy
Mulvey of the Union of Concerned Scientists. The report found that hackers had
targeted American nonprofit groups working on a campaign called #ExxonKnew,
which argued that the company had hidden information about climate change.
Numerous Union of Concerned Scientists employees received suspicious emails in
which hackers tried to trick them into giving up passwords or installing malicious
software. Prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of
New York began an investigation.
One associate of Mr. Forlit, Aviram Azari, pleaded guilty in New York in 2023 to
crimes including computer intrusion, wire fraud and identity theft and was
sentenced to six years in prison.
Mr. Forlit ran three security and intelligence-gathering firms, two registered in
Israel and one in the United States, that hired people to hack into email accounts
and devices, the filing said. His clients included a Washington lobbying firm
working on behalf of “one of the world’s largest oil and gas corporations, centered
in Irving, Texas, in relation to ongoing climate change litigation being brought
against it.” Exxon was previously headquartered in Irving.
The lobbying firm identified targets to Mr. Forlit, then he or another person gave a
list to Mr. Azari, who owned another Israel-based firm and hired people in India to
illegally access the accounts, the filing said. Those details were used to obtain
documents that were given to the oil company and the media “to undermine the
integrity of the civil investigations,” the filing said.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/climate/hacking-for-hire-exxon-forlit-

said on Wednesday, after three people were fatally shot the day before, in the latest
blow to a country grappling with high levels of gun violence compared to its
European peers.
The three victims were found in a hair salon in the city of Uppsala, about 43 miles
from Stockholm, the capital. They were between 15 and 20 years old, according to
the police, but have not been publicly identified.
The motive was unclear, but the police, who said they responded to reports of “loud
bangs” shortly after 5 p.m. on Tuesday, said they were investigating if the shooting
had been gang-related.
“We can’t say that it has a clear connection to any gang conflict at the moment, but
it’s one of the ideas that we are working particularly intensively on,” Erik Akerlund,
head of the Uppsala police and of the special incident command, said at a news
conference on Wednesday morning.
Teenager Is Arrested on Suspicion of Murder
After 3 Are Shot in Sweden
The teenage suspect, who was not identified, had recently run away from a group
home for children, Magnus Berggren, Uppsala’s deputy chief prosecutor, said
during a news conference later on Wednesday.
Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, condemned the shooting as “a terrible
act” and lamented that “brutal and ruthless violence is once again shaking our
country.”
Despite its reputation for a high standard of living, Sweden has been plagued by
one of the higher rates of gun violence in the European Union, and violent crime
has been on the rise in recent years. The country experienced its worst mass
shooting in February, when a man open fired on an adult education center, killing
10 people.
Factors like the suspect’s age indicate that the shooting may be connected to
gangs, said Diamant Salihu, an investigative journalist for the Swedish public
service broadcaster, SVT, and the author of two books about gang violence and
criminal networks in Sweden.
“During the past decade, we have seen an escalation of deadly shootings,” Mr.
Salihu said. “More recently, the change is that there are very many young shooters
who do it for payment and status,” he added.
The shooting occurred ahead of the Walpurgis celebrations, where Swedes
celebrate the beginning of spring with public bonfires. The police said there was no
current danger to the public.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/europe/sweden-shooting-

several towns near Jerusalem and call for international assistance on Wednesday

The fires interrupted Israel’s annual memorial day for the country’s fallen, one of
the most hallowed dates on the national calendar. Television broadcasts of solemn
ceremonies in military cemeteries were replaced with footage of Israelis making
their way to safety on foot along a major highway.

canceled because of the expanding fires and inclement weather, including high
winds. The cause of the wildfire was not immediately clear.

service said its medics had treated at least 19 people for light injuries.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement that a combination
of strong wind and dryness had created a “deadly combination,” aggravating the
blazes.
Israel has requested international aid to fight the wildfires, which were still
spreading as of Wednesday evening. Officials had reached out to Britain, France,
Greece, Italy and other countries for assistance, according to the Israeli
government.
The Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West
Bank, offered to help in snuffing out the fires, Hussein al-Sheikh, a senior
Palestinian official, said in a text message. In 2021, Palestinian firefighters joined
Israeli efforts to beat back a similar wildfire near Jerusalem.
Israeli officials did not respond to requests for comment as to whether they would
accept the Palestinian offer.
Mr. Caspi said over the weekend — following a smaller but still intense fire near
Jerusalem — that climate change was likely exacerbating the strength of Israel’s
wildfires.
“This specific fire was advancing at eight meters per second. There has been
nothing like it,” he said at a news conference last weekend. “When we talk about
global warming, this is the reality.”

Julie Turkewitz;Isayen Herrera,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,A Mother and Father Were Deported Under Trump. But What Happened to Their Daughter?,"A Venezuelan family is calling for a 2-year-old to be returned to her mother after
the U.S. authorities deported the mother to Venezuela on Friday without the child.
The girl’s father was sent to a prison in El Salvador in March.
The toddler, Maikelys Antonella Espinoza Bernal, remains in foster care in the
United States, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Officials said in
a statement that the child was removed from her parents and from the manifest of
her mother’s deportation plane for her own “safety and welfare.”
The Trump administration claims the girl’s parents are members of Tren de
Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, but it has not offered evidence to back this up.
The girl, known to many in her family as Antonella, is one of several children who
have been swept up in President Trump’s immigration crackdown in recent days.
At least three children who are U.S. citizens were sent to Honduras this month with
their mothers, decisions protested by the families’ lawyers.
In the case of the Venezuelan toddler, the girl’s mother, Yorely Bernal, 20, had
entered the United States with her partner, Maiker Espinoza, and their child in
May 2024, while President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was still in office.

Happened to Their Toddler?

that Antonella was passed from foster parent to foster
parent, landing in a string of homes in the course of a year.

According to the couple’s relatives, the authorities told them their tattoos looked
suspicious, took them into custody and sent the girl to foster care.
During Mr. Trump’s first administration, family separations at the border drew
anger and legal challenges, and eventually ceased to be used as a blanket policy.
But separations continued to take place in limited instances during the Biden
administration when officials believed there was a threat to the child.
It is unclear why officials separated the family members last year. Record searches
indicate that neither parent has a criminal record in Venezuela or Peru, where they
lived for several years, or in the United States, beyond their immigration offenses.
In the United States the couple has lived only in immigration detention.
In 2022, Mr. Espinoza, now 25, was arrested in Peru on an allegation of domestic
violence, but the case was closed and he never faced trial, according to records.
U.S. officials sent Mr. Espinoza to El Salvador on March 30 on one of five planes
carrying Venezuelan men to a maximum-security prison. The Trump
administration claims that all the Venezuelan men on those flights are members of
Tren de Aragua, but it has provided little proof of this.

In late April, Ms. Bernal called her mother, Raida Inciarte, to tell her that she was
going to be deported back to Venezuela, Ms. Inciarte said in an interview. American
officials had told Ms. Bernal that Antonella would be coming with her, Ms. Inciarte
said.
On the video call, Ms. Bernal showed her mother a document from immigration
authorities bearing Antonella’s name, which she claimed indicated the child would
be leaving the United States with her.
But when Ms. Bernal boarded the deportation flight to Caracas, the Venezuelan
capital, on April 25, her child was not there.
From her home in Maracaibo, Venezuela, Ms. Inciarte called on the American
government to release the child, who she said has lived in four foster homes while
her parents were in immigration detention over the past year. (Ms. Inciarte has
been in touch with a case worker and the foster parents, she said.)
Her daughter, she said, had arrived home in Maracaibo on Sunday, and spent
Monday morning crying in her bedroom.

“That little girl,” she said of the toddler, “has a family that has been suffering every
day for a year.”
The toddler is under the supervision of the Office of Refugee Resettlement,
according to the Department of Homeland Security, referring to a part of the
Department of Health and Human Services. An official at that office referred all
questions to the D.H.S.
The Trump administration did not say when, or if, the child would be reunited with
her family.
In its statement, Homeland Security said Mr. Espinoza was a “lieutenant” of Tren
de Aragua who oversees criminal operations, including a “torture house,” and that
Ms. Bernal directed the “recruitment of young women for drug smuggling and
prostitution.”
“President Trump and Secretary Noem take their responsibility to protect children
seriously,” said the statement, referring to the department’s secretary, Kristi Noem.
“We will not allow this child to be abused and continue to be exposed to criminal
activity that endangers her safety.”
María Alejandra Fernández, 31, Mr. Espinoza’s sister, said: “My brother is not a
criminal. He left Venezuela like many young people, looking for an opportunity to
get ahead.”
A protest last month in Caracas, Venezuela, of family members of Venezuelans deported from the United

The department did not respond to a request for more details about the allegations
of gang connections.
Ms. Inciarte said the toddler’s first foster homes were in the El Paso area. But
Antonella was placed in a new home in recent days, Ms. Inciarte said a foster
mother told her, and now she wasn’t sure where that home was located.
The new foster mother did not respond to messages from The New York Times.
The Trump administration has said that Tren de Aragua has “invaded” the United
States, which the president is using to justify the rapid deportations of hundreds of
Venezuelans and to fulfill a campaign promise to take a hard line against
undocumented immigrants.
Ms. Bernal and Mr. Espinoza fled economic and political crises at home in
Venezuela, their families said, and met while living in Peru. She worked at a fast
food stand. He worked as a bricklayer and in ironwork, until opening a business as
a barber, said his sister, Ms. Fernández, who lives in Venezuela.

Antonella was born in Lima on Feb. 8, 2023, according to her birth certificate,
which lists the couple as her parents. When the girl was 1, Ms. Bernal and Mr.
Espinoza decided to follow a growing flow of migrants to the United States, said
their families.
Salaries in Peru were low, said Ms. Inciarte, and the situation wasn’t improving in
Venezuela.
“They got excited,” she said, “and set out to pursue the American dream.”
The couple left Peru, and — with their child in tow — crossed Ecuador, Colombia,
the Darién jungle, which connects South America with Panama and Central
America. In Mexico, they were briefly kidnapped by what Mr. Espinoza’s sister
described as “coyotes,” or migrant traffickers.
Last May, the families said, the two turned themselves in at the U.S. border.

From detention, Ms. Bernal told her mother in a call that the authorities believed
her tattoos — she has many — made her a “gang member.”
But it wasn’t until Mr. Trump took office, said the families, that the accusations
became more specific: The government believed that they were members of Tren
de Aragua.
Ms. Bernal’s tattoos include her parents’ birth years inscribed on her neck, as well
as a lightning bolt, a small flame and a serpent, her mother said. Mr. Espinoza’s
tattoos include the cartoon characters Yosemite Sam and Marvin the Martian,
according to a statement he gave to the authorities, as well as a cross, a crown and
a compass with a plane.
Internal government documents indicate that the U.S. authorities are citing tattoos
to label people as members of Tren de Aragua, though there is little evidence that
the gang uses tattoos as markers of membership.
In her conversations with the foster parents over the last year, Ms. Inciarte, said
the parents described Antonella as “sweet” and “independent” for a toddler. But
they also noted that the girl cried when she moved among families and seemed
confused about who she belonged to.
This anguished the grandmother, who worried about “psychological damage,” she
said.
“Today she wakes up with one mother,” she said, “tomorrow she has another.”

Andrew E. Kramer,NYT,1,World,5/3/2025,Ukraine Rejects Russian Call for a Three-Day Cease-Fire,"President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday said Ukraine will not adhere to a three-
day cease-fire proposed by Russia, saying such a short truce would not help in
negotiations for a lasting peace.
Ukraine in March accepted a proposal from the Trump administration for a 30-day
cease-fire, to be followed by talks on matters including the location of an armistice
line, steps to safeguard a nuclear power plant occupied by the Russian army and
deployment of a possible European peacekeeping force.
On Saturday Mr. Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv that the Russian counteroffer of a
three-day cease-fire covering the anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe,
an important political holiday in Russia, was merely a “theatrical show.”

He said Russia’s offer was intended to “create a soft atmosphere of an exit from
isolation” for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and to assuage security worries
of foreign leaders and dignitaries attending a Victory Day parade in Moscow on
May 9. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has accepted an invitation to attend the
parade.
“We are simply either at war, or Putin shows he is ready to stop shooting as a first
step to ending the war,” Mr. Zelensky said. Ukraine’s offer of a 30-day truce
remains on the table, he added, saying Ukraine would be willing to start that truce
before the May 9 holiday if Russia accepted it.
The military parade last May in Red Square on Victory Day, celebrating the defeat of Nazi Germany.

Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Kyiv has designed
and manufactured a growing fleet of exploding long-range drones capable of
striking Moscow, and has repeatedly targeted the Russian capital.
Mr. Zelensky said Saturday that Ukraine would offer no safety guarantees to
guests at the Red Square parade on May 9, as Russia has carried on missile strikes
on Ukraine despite visits by foreign leaders to Kyiv. Last week, Ukraine’s military
intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, aired a more direct threat, saying guests to the
parade should “bring earplugs.”
The spokeswoman for Russia’s foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova, responded that
Mr. Zelensky’s comments were a “direct threat” to Russia’s celebration. The deputy
head of Russia’s security council, Dmitri A. Medvedev, threatened retaliation for
any attacks during the anniversary ceremonies, writing in a post on Telegram that,
“in the event of a real provocation on Victory Day, nobody guarantees Kyiv will see
May 10.”
The rejection of Russia’s offer comes as Mr. Zelensky has found himself on
somewhat surer ground with the Trump administration in cease-fire talks, mending
relations after a disastrous Oval Office shouting match in February. He has taken
pains to point out that Ukraine accepted the administration’s proposed cease-fire
followed by substantive talks, while Russia has not.
Though its advances on the battlefield have slowed to a crawl amid staggering
casualties, Russia is still seen as having momentum in the war and would lose
leverage if fighting halted for any significant period.
President Trump last month expressed frustration with Russian foot-dragging in
talks and bombardments of Ukrainian cities that have killed scores of civilians,
posting on social media, “Vladimir STOP!” after a missile strike in Kyiv killed 12
people and wounded dozens.

In his comments on Saturday, Mr. Zelensky praised the change of tone in a meeting
with Mr. Trump on the sidelines of the funeral of Pope Francis last month, calling it
his “best conversation” yet with the American leader.
As the two sat face-to-face on chairs in the Vatican, he said, he had broached a U.S.
resumption of the provision of air defense weapons to Ukraine and suggested that
America impose additional sanctions on Russia. “I won’t speak of the details, but
what he told me sounded strong,” Mr. Zelensky said.
On Thursday, the spokeswoman for the State Department, Tammy K. Bruce, said
the United States would step back as a mediator in the talks, which have yielded
only limited commitments to reduce airstrikes on energy infrastructure and an
earlier, one-day cease-fire on Easter Sunday that both sides accused the other of
violating.
“We certainly will remain committed to it and will help where we can,” Ms. Bruce
said of the search for peace. But, she said, “we are not going to fly around the world
at the drop of a hat to mediate meetings.” The negotiations, she said, would depend
on Russia and Ukraine presenting “concrete ideas about how this conflict is going
to end. It’s going to be up to them.”
On Saturday, Mr. Zelensky suggested the United States would step back after a
cease-fire was achieved. He said that “apparently, after an agreement on a cease-
fire, some countries would like us to remain one-on-one with the Russians.”
In response to a question about the prospect of the Trump administration walking
away from talks, Mr. Zelensky said he expected European nations to play a role.
The Europeans, he said, will “be nearby.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/world/europe/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-talks.html
Constant Méheut,NYT,1,World,4/17/2025,The Ukrainian Schoolmaster Teaching History to His Invaders,"On a recent afternoon in Bila Tserkva, a quiet city in central Ukraine, a 59-year-old
history teacher settled into a colorful cafe, opened a laptop and logged into
Chatroulette, an online platform that connects strangers worldwide.
His goal? To teach Russians, citizens of a nation that has invaded his, a bit of
Ukrainian history.
Within minutes, a middle-aged Russian man appeared on the screen, speaking
from what looked like a grocery store. Vitalii Dribnytsia, the history teacher,
wasted no time, opening with a deliberately provocative question: “Who does
Crimea belong to?” he asked, referring to the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula that
Russia illegally annexed in 2014.
Want to stay updated on what’s happening in Russia and Ukraine? Sign
up for Your Places: Global Update, and we’ll send our latest coverage to
your inbox.
“To us,” the man replied without hesitation.
What followed was a dizzying exchange on the historical roots of Ukraine and
Russia, Ukraine’s war of independence from 1917 to 1921, and the Ukrainian
language. At times, the Russian man hesitated about historical facts, but in the end,
he waved it all away. “The internet will tell you everything,” he said. “Ukraine
never existed and never will.”
This was just one of hundreds of online conversations Mr. Dribnytsia, a former
middle school and high school teacher, has had with random Russians over the past
three years of war, as he seeks to challenge the Kremlin’s narrative that Ukrainian
nationhood is a fiction and, by extension, that Ukraine belongs to Russia.
Almost every day, for several hours at a time, Mr. Dribnytsia engages with
Russians on Chatroulette, using a matter-of-fact tone and sharp questions to try to
debunk widely held beliefs in Russia: that Ukraine as a nation was created by the
Soviet Union, that its leaders are neo-Nazis or that its language is merely a dialect
of Russian.
Videos of Mr. Dribnytsia’s candid discussions, which he uploads to YouTube, have
attracted a huge following in Ukraine. His YouTube channel, called “Vox Veritatis,”
Latin for “The Voice of the Truth,” boasts nearly half a million subscribers, with
Ukrainians watching the conversations to learn more about their own history and
sharpen their arguments in defense of Ukraine’s right to sovereignty.
His exchanges have offered a rare and unusual window into the politicization of
history in Russia, shedding light on the ideological foundations behind Russia’s
attempts to erase Ukraine’s past and identity, including by systematically
destroying Ukrainian cultural sites.
“People usually don’t know their own history. That’s normal. But in this war, in
Russia, it’s not just ignorance — it’s the weaponization of history,” Mr. Dribnytsia
said in a recent interview in Bila Tserkva, his hometown. “I’m just trying to set the
record straight.”
A monument in Kyiv commemorating victims of the Holodomor, a Kremlin-engineered famine that killed

A burly man with a white beard, Mr. Dribnytsia knows from experience how
history can be used as a political tool. He studied history in Kyiv in the final years
that Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, when liberalizing reforms were
beginning to lift the lid on decades of hushed-up historical events.
He still remembers one of his professors describing the Holodomor, the Kremlin-
engineered famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in 1932-33, as “an invention of
Western bourgeois historians” — only for students to later read about the famine in
Pravda, the Communist Party’s official newspaper.
“We entered university as typical Soviet students. But by the time we graduated,
the ideological landscape had completely changed,” said Mr. Dribnytsia, who
graduated with a master’s degree in 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed and
Ukraine declared independence.
He began teaching the same year, using textbooks that had not yet been updated
from Soviet times. Mr. Dribnytsia had to rely on his own research and books
written by little-known reformist historians to present a version of events as
accurate as possible.
“I understood that I had to teach children this new information — the facts that had
either been hidden from us or distorted by Soviet history,” he said.
Former students of Mr. Dribnytsia in Bila Tserkva remember him as a demanding
yet passionate teacher.
“He wanted each of us to know our history because a person can only move
forward and make informed decisions by understanding the past,” said Iryna
Semyhailo, 31, now a math teacher in Bila Tserkva.
Though far from the front lines, the sound of drones streaking toward Kyiv are frequently heard over the
town of Bila Tserkva, and several buildings in the town have been destroyed by drone strikes. Brendan

In 2021, Mr. Dribnytsia retired because of serious health issues. That summer, Mr.
Putin published a 5,300-word essay distorting history to claim that Ukrainians and
Russians are “one people” — an argument he would later use to justify his invasion
as a liberation of Ukraine from the West.
Alarmed by the Kremlin’s propaganda, Mr. Dribnytsia began devoting his time to
engaging in online discussions with Russians about history. But what started as an
attempt at open dialogue quickly evolved into a project focused on debunking
Moscow’s narrative, particularly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022.
Drawing from his teaching skills, Mr. Dribnytsia often peppers his interlocutors
with precise questions and cuts them off to point out factual errors — ultimately
pushing them to confront the inconsistencies in their reasoning.
In a video of a conversation recorded two years ago, seen by 1.7 million people, Mr.
Dribnytsia responds to a man who claims that Russians and Ukrainians are
brothers, echoing Mr. Putin’s argument. “How do you define brotherly nations?”
Mr. Dribnytsia asks.
“From history,” the man replies. “We have a shared past.”
Mr. Dribnytsia is the co-author of this
seventh grade Ukrainian history
textbook.

“If Austrians and Hungarians lived in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, does that
mean Austrians and Hungarians are brothers?” Mr. Dribnytsia snaps back,
pointing to two nations that are now neighbors but speak different languages and
have distinct traditions.
The Russian man then points out that Russia and Ukraine share a common
religion, Christian Orthodoxy. Mr. Dribnytsia responds by noting that about a tenth
of Ukrainians are Greek Catholics, before pressing again: why should Russians and
Ukrainians be considered brothers?
“Maybe I’m mistaken,” the Russian man concedes, “though I don’t think so.”
Since mid-2021, Mr. Dribnytsia has recorded over 1,500 conversations — enough to
plant seeds of doubt in some of his interlocutors, though he often encounters
outright hostility.
By his own admission, he hasn’t had much success changing peoples’ minds. Most
Russians he encounters either dismiss his arguments outright or echo Kremlin
talking points. Only a small minority, usually those who oppose the war, engage in
genuine historical debates, he says.
During a recent online chat, a Russian woman praised Mr. Dribnytsia’s work,
urging him to keep “laying out the facts.” Dimitri, a 27-year-old Russian who
opposes the war, said in a phone interview that the videos had taught him about
events overlooked in Russian textbooks, such as the existence of a Ukrainian state
in the late 1910s.
Over time, Mr. Dribnytsia realized his true audience isn’t Russians, but the millions
of Ukrainians who were educated in Soviet times and now want to update their
knowledge — part of a broader movement in wartime Ukraine to break free from
decades of Soviet and Russian influences.
Mr. Dribnytsia, walking along the banks of the Ros River in Bila Tserkva. “People usually don’t know

Some of his videos, where he discusses the first appearance of Ukraine on world
maps or the complex history of Ukrainian nationalist movements — two topics that
were either ignored or distorted in Soviet textbooks — have garnered over a
million views.
“I’m learning a lot from him,” said Natalia Tylina, a 64-year-old Ukrainian retiree
who described herself as “formed in the Soviet Union.” She said she now feels more
confident to argue with acquaintances who “don’t know our history at all” and
spread Russian narratives.
In his conversations, Mr. Dribnytsia is often asked about the darker chapters of
Ukrainian history, including the collaboration of nationalist movements with the
Nazis during World War II. He doesn’t shy away from the topic, acknowledging
their collaboration while also noting that the Nazis later suppressed those same
groups.
Three years of war and as much time trying to correct historical falsehoods have
taken a toll on Mr. Dribnytsia. He loses his calm more often during online
conversations, and he has come to believe it is futile to try to change the minds of
his Russian interlocutors.
“Most of them go on Chatroulette to target Ukrainians and push their fabricated
narratives,” he said. “They’re not here to hear a different perspective or learn
something new.”
Yaroslav Hrytsak, a prominent Ukrainian historian who has watched Mr.
Dribnytsia’s videos, said his work might seem in vain. But if nobody sets the record
straight, he noted, then “Mr. Putin wins.”
“His efforts actually make perfect sense,” Mr. Hrytsak said. “It’s about restoring
our dignity, proving that Ukraine as a nation exists.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/world/europe/ukraine-history-russian-falsehoods.html
Jin Yu Young,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,South Korea to Use Drones to Deter Birds After Deadly Jeju Air Crash,"South Korea will begin deploying drones at airports in the first half of this year to
help prevent bird strikes, part of an overhaul of aviation safety that was announced
four months after the deadliest aviation disaster in the country.
The government also said it aimed to rebuild some crucial infrastructure at six
airports by the end of the year, devise measures to combat pilot fatigue, and
increase the number of safety supervisors.
On Dec. 29, the pilots of Jeju Air Flight 2216 declared “Mayday” and told air traffic
controllers there had been a bird strike as the plane was descending into Muan
International Airport in the country’s southwest. After making a sharp turn, the jet
landed on its belly, slid down the runway and rammed into a concrete barrier,
exploding into a fireball that killed 179 of the 181 people on board.
Aviation safety experts have suggested that the collision with the barrier — an
antenna array used to guide aircraft during landing called a localizer — may have
contributed to the high death toll. Such concrete localizers like the one in Muan will
South Korea to Use Drones to Deter Birds After
Deadly Air Crash
be replaced with frangible structures that break apart easily, the government said
Wednesday.
Investigators have not identified the reasons for the crash and what role, if any, a
bird strike might have played. But the country’s transport ministry said bird
feathers and blood were found in both of the jet’s engines. An investigation by The
New York Times revealed that officials from the Korea Airports Corporation — a
state-owned company that operates nearly all of the country’s airports — had been
warned for years before the crash about the risks of bird strikes at the airport in
Muan.
The transport ministry said Wednesday it would begin deploying drones at
airports in the first half of this year to prevent birds from approaching. By the end
of next year, it plans to develop drones that can identify birds and release bird
repellents, which will then be rolled out to all of the nation’s airports starting in
2028. Drones are commonly used by airports worldwide to scare away flocks of
birds in a plane’s flight path, experts say.
South Korea’s government had in February already pledged 247 billion won
(around $174 million) over three years to improve bird-strike prevention measures
at all the country’s airports. Those included installing bird-detection devices and
implementing a national radar model that would alert air traffic controllers, safety
staff and pilots to the presence of birds.
The ministry said Wednesday it will begin installing thermal imaging cameras in
June and sound wave generators starting in August. In the statement, it also said it
would add laser guns to deterrent measures and acquire more cars to patrol
airports. Muan International Airport didn’t have many of these tools at the time of
the crash.
Officials from the government and the airport have publicly acknowledged that the
airport’s bird-prevention patrol team was short staffed and lacked sufficient
equipment to keep the birds away from the airport.
On Wednesday, the government also vowed to collaborate with local aviation
offices and the Korea Airports Corporation to prevent birds from flocking to land
surrounding airports, several of which are near marshy wetlands where many
birds roost. Conservationists have criticized flight officials for building airports in
proximity to bird habitats.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/asia/south-korea-jeju-air-

Ruth Maclean,NYT,1,World,5/3/2025,Ghana Wanted a Cathedral. It Got an ‘Expensive Hole’ Instead.,"The walls surrounding Ghana’s national cathedral are aging plywood. Its spires are
yellow construction cranes, which have not moved in years. It frequently
reverberates with singing — the singing of a choir of frogs that moves in whenever
the cathedral’s half-finished foundations fill with rainwater.
Ghana’s former president, Nana Akufo-Addo, spent around $58 million of public
money on the $400 million cathedral project — a huge sum in this debt-saddled
West African country. The new finance minister said in March that Ghana’s
economy was in “severe distress.”
The cathedral was designed by the celebrity architect David Adjaye. But beyond
the blueprints, there is very little to show for the money.
“They have only dug a hole — a big hole,” Praise Chinedu, a student and a
Pentecostal Christian, said last month.

Across Accra, Ghana’s coastal capital, citizens joke that the hole is the biggest and
most expensive in the world. A valuable stretch of land surrounded by museums,
bank headquarters and some of Ghana’s ritziest hotels was cleared of government
buildings for the church. That land is now thick with vegetation and bird life,
unvisited except by scrap metal thieves and, occasionally in the rainy season,
swimmers staging stunts for social media.
By The New York Times
The unbuilt cathedral became a symbol of economic mismanagement and a
political battleground after Mr. Akufo-Addo said that its construction was to fulfill a
personal pledge he had made to God.
Now that Mr. Akufo-Addo has left office, the project appears permanently doomed.
The cathedral is now a major target of the new government’s anticorruption
initiative, called Operation Recover All Loot. Last month, the government
announced it would no longer fund the project and dissolved the agency
responsible for managing it.

especially important to young people, has seen a recent boom in church building.

But the national cathedral project never attracted the support Mr. Akufo-Addo
anticipated. Instead, construction stalled at its foundations as Ghana suffered its
worst economic crisis in a generation.
A church service in Accra last month.
To many Ghanaians lately, a cathedral has seemed like the last thing the country
needs, especially one with an estimated cost of $400 million.
The project began with much fanfare. In 2019, at a fund-raising dinner in
Washington, a smiling Mr. Akufo-Addo cut into a large gray, square confection —
the planned cathedral rendered in cake. With a 5,000-seat auditorium and a
concave roof referencing the curve of Asante royal stools, it was intended to be
much more than just a cathedral. It was to be a national monument, similar to the
Washington National Cathedral or London’s Westminster Abbey. A place where the
solemn ceremonies of state — like presidents’ funerals and royal weddings —
would take place.
Mr. Akufo-Addo, who was born into a Presbyterian family but became an Anglican
as a young man, told the group gathered in Washington that the
interdenominational cathedral would be a unifier for Ghanaian Christians, who
represent more than 70 percent of the population. It would also be an offering of
thanks to God for sparing the country from the epidemics, civil wars and famines
that had plagued its neighbors, he said.
But then he revealed a third reason for its construction.
“I made a pledge to God that if I become the president — after two unsuccessful
attempts — in the 2016 presidential elections, I will build a cathedral to the glory of
God,” he said, according to official readouts of the event.
Former President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana last month in his home office. “I find it difficult to see what
is so problematic about it,” he said of the cathedral project.
The statement turned out to be a gift to Mr. Akufo-Addo’s opponents, who argued
that the president should not be allowed to use public money as part of a personal
bargain he made with God — let alone $58 million of it.
Paul Opoku-Mensah, the executive director of the agency overseeing the project,
said that demonizing the cathedral quickly became “a political strategy.”
In March 2024, one member of Parliament, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, led a march
to the construction site, cutting a red ribbon at its gate to poke fun at the president
for commissioning what was still a giant hole.
“We are demanding that the contracts must be immediately terminated to avoid
further financial loss to the state,” he said.
If using the cathedral to target the president was a political strategy, it worked.
John Mahama, a former president who promised to create jobs and fix the
economy, pulled off a dramatic comeback in December’s election. He made Mr.
Okudzeto Ablakwa his foreign minister.
Corruption accusations often take center stage in Ghanaian elections, and the large
sums involved in the national cathedral project convinced many Ghanaians that
officials had been skimming off the top. A public ombudsman said procurement
rules had been breached and recommended a forensic audit.
But in an interview by the big hole in early April, Mr. Opoku-Mensah said he had
nothing to hide and had handed over all the accounts to the investigators.
A meeting room at the cathedral project site.
He explained that the cathedral was not really intended as a church, but as a major
monument that had needed state money to get started but would eventually
become a profit-making magnet for visitors.
“It’s a fundamental misunderstanding of the vision,” he said.
Mr. Akufo-Addo also seemed befuddled about the controversy. “I find it difficult to
see what is so problematic about it,” he said in an interview in April in his book-
lined home office surrounded by a lush garden. He mused aloud about whether
people believed it “would be too big a tribute to my leadership.”
Now that the country’s leaders have changed, few Ghanaians admit to supporting
the cathedral. Those who do say Mr. Akufo-Addo and others should foot the bill —
but not taxpayers.
“It should be funded through donations,” said Esi Darko, an architect, as she left
church one recent afternoon in an Accra neighborhood known as Christian Village.
“It shouldn’t be imposed upon everyone because not all are Christians.”
There are also around five million Muslims in Ghana, a country of more than 35
million people, and, lately, a growing number of atheists.
“Don’t believe in God?” reads a billboard in central Accra. “You are not alone.”
Lawrence Tetteh, a Ghanaian pastor, delivering a sermon at the Fountain of Life Mission Church in
Accra.
Even prominent Christians have soured on the project. Arriving at the church he
leads on a recent Sunday, one well-known pastor, Lawrence Tetteh, and his sister
Lady Gifty Tetteh, a British Ghanaian barrister, ducked into Mr. Tetteh’s office for
an interview.
He embraced the cathedral project initially, he said. He thought Christians from
different denominations would be brought together by it, just as Ghanaian Muslims
are by the national mosque, built by Turkey in 2021. But when he saw so much state
money being spent, Mr. Tetteh said, he stopped supporting the idea.
“We are a developing nation,” he said. “As much as it’s nice to have an edifice, we
also don’t want a situation where our edifice will eat into the little the nation has to
live on.”
Ms. Tetteh said that God would understand if the president explained that he could
not make good on his cathedral promise. “God is not a hard taskmaster,” she said.
Perhaps, she suggested, the former president could build him a little prayer room
instead.

Ségolène Le Stradic,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,Mosque Killing Puts French View of Muslims Under Scrutiny,"The fatal stabbing of a Muslim worshiper in a mosque in France has prompted
heated criticism of government officials who did not initially treat it as a possible
hate crime or show the degree of concern they had in other fatal attacks.
The victim, Aboubakar Cissé, a 21 year-old from Mali, was stabbed dozens of times
Friday morning while he was praying in a mosque in La Grand-Combe, a small
town in southern France, about 50 miles northwest of Avignon.
The main suspect, who filmed himself standing over the victim, was heard
insulting Allah in the video, which was posted on Snapchat, French news media
reported.
A local prosecutor at first suggested — wrongly, it emerged — that the killing had
stemmed from a dispute between two worshipers. But on Sunday, that prosecutor,
Abdelkrim Grini, said in a TV interview that the killing was being investigated as
an “anti-Muslim act” or “an act with Islamophobic connotations.” Other motives are
being explored, he added, including “a fascination with death, a desire to kill and a
desire to be considered a serial killer.”
A Killing in a Mosque Puts France’s View of
Muslims Under Scrutiny
The suspect fled to Italy before turning himself in on Sunday at a police station in
Pistoia, a small town near Florence, Cécile Gensac, the Nîmes prosecutor, said on
Monday. The suspect was identified as a French national of Bosnian origin, born in
2004, who was previously unknown to the police, but nothing else about him or his
views has been made public.
He has not yet been returned to France, which a prosecutor said could take weeks,
or charged with a crime.
“It’s an Islamophobic crime, it’s an act of terrorism, and today we are afraid,”
Aminata Konaté-Boune, a spokesperson for Mr. Cissé’s Soninke ethnic group, said
at a news conference with the victim’s family on Tuesday. “Tomorrow, what will
happen? Will they come knocking on our doors to kill us? Will there be a hunt for
Muslims?”
The killing happened the day after a girl was stabbed to death at a high school in
Nantes, allegedly by another student who was fascinated with Hitler. The school
attack, which also wounded three others, prompted a strong and swift government
reaction, prompting critics to accuse the government of a double standard.

Bruno Retailleau, France’s conservative interior minister, posted a message on
social media on the day of the attack at the mosque expressing support for the
victim’s family and the Muslim community.
But unlike in Nantes, where he visited the crime scene hours after the attack, he
did not immediately rush to the mosque. Instead, he traveled on Sunday to Alès, a
nearby town, where he met with the local prosecutor and mayors.
President Emmanuel Macron of France did not comment on the attack until
Sunday. “I extend the support of the nation to his family and to our fellow citizens
of the Muslim faith,” he said on social media. “Racism and hatred based on religion
will never have a place in France. Freedom of worship is inviolable.”
Yoro Cissé, the victim’s cousin, told the news agency Agence France-Presse on
Tuesday that no member of the government had contacted his family. “We want to
feel safe; France is a country we love,” he said. “We want to feel like everybody
else.”
Ten percent of France’s population is Muslim, according to a 2023 study by the
National Statistics Institute. Islam has grown, at a time when more people profess
no religious affiliation, to become the country’s second-largest faith.
France, which upholds its own brand of secularism known as “laïcité” —
guaranteeing freedom of conscience and the neutrality of the state and of some
public spaces — has an uneasy relationship with Islam. Muslim clothing like
headscarves and full-length robes have stirred endless debate and various
attempts to ban them.
“The least we can say is that the authorities were slow to react,” to the mosque
killing, said Hakim El Karoui, a Muslim business consultant and the author of the
book “Islam, a French Religion.” “Being on the side of Muslims is not popular when
you are a politician in France.”
About 1,000 people marched silently in La Grand-Combe on Sunday to honor Mr.
Cissé’s memory. But some deplored the absence of politicians, French news media
reported.

Assembly in Paris on Tuesday. Ludovic Marin/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images
Another demonstration was organized the same day at the Place de la République
in Paris at the behest of left-wing politicians and associations.
“This violence is the result of an Islamophobic climate that has been cultivated for
months,” said Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the leftist France Unbowed party,
during the protest. That the interior minister did not rush to visit the mosque was
“incomprehensible,” he added.
On Tuesday, Yaël Braun-Pivet, the president of the National Assembly, held a
minute of silence for Mr. Cissé in the lower house, though she said top lawmakers
had not reached an agreement to do so.
Djibril Cissé, the victim’s uncle, said that he had been shocked by the news
coverage of his nephew’s death and by the reactions of politicians.
“He was a sociable person who was a source of hope for all of us,” he said.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/europe/france-mosque-

Mujib Mashal;Hari Kumar,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,India’s Muslims Fear a Growing Backlash After Kashmir Attack,"Widespread detentions and demolitions of property targeting Muslims in India
have provoked concerns that right-wing Hindu nationalists are exploiting last
week’s terrorist attack in Kashmir to deepen a campaign of oppression against the
country’s largest minority group.
Public anger has swelled after 26 people — all but one of them Hindu tourists —
were killed by militants near the town of Pahalgam in the Indian-administered part
of Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region. India has said that Pakistan had a
supporting hand in the attack, an accusation that Pakistan denies.
India has appeared to be preparing to strike Pakistan militarily in response to the
terrorist attack, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowing to hunt down the
terrorists and “raze” their safe havens. A Pakistani government minister said on
Tuesday that Pakistan believed an Indian strike was imminent.
On Wednesday, Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, urged the United States
to press India to de-escalate tensions and “act responsibly,” the state-run PTV said
on Wednesday, after Mr. Sharif had a phone call with Secretary of State Marco
Rubio.
So far, India’s central government has been focused on carrying out a series of
punitive measures against Pakistan, including threatening to disrupt the flow of
cross-border rivers. But officials and right-wing Hindu groups have intensified
harassment of Muslims, which they have framed as a drive against illegal
migrants.
In several states run by Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, local officials have used
the moment to hound what they call “illegal Bangladeshis” and Rohingya, the
Muslim minority who have fled Myanmar. Such labels, including “Pakistani,” are
often used to target Muslim migrants from other parts of India.
The killings of Muslims were reported in two states, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka,
with media reports suggesting they were hate crimes.
Inside Kashmir, security forces have arrested hundreds as they seek the
perpetrators of the April 22 attack, and they have blown up the homes of people
they have accused of having terrorist affiliations. The sweeps, which has included
the detention of 2,000 people according to one official, resemble the collective
punishments that the authorities have previously carried out after attacks on
security forces in Kashmir.
Kashmiris in other states have reported harassment and violence, with right-wing
groups filming themselves assaulting Kashmiri roadside salesmen and threatening
violence if Kashmiris do not leave.

“The attack in Pahalgam was horrible but should not become a pretext to engage in
reprisals and attacks on minorities, including arbitrary arrests or summary
punishments,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, the deputy Asia director at Human Rights
Watch.
Ms. Ganguly said that “ultranationalist broadcast networks and social media users
have been inciting hate” that has resulted in violence.
The immediate backlash after the terrorist attack was targeted at Kashmiris and
soon spread to a wider anti-Muslim sentiment. That, analysts said, has furthered a
demonization of Muslims that Mr. Modi’s party has long employed to unite India’s
Hindu majority.
In the days after the attack, Kashmiri students studying in cities around India
reported harassment and threats. Kashmir’s top elected official, Omar Abdullah,
sent government ministers to different cities to help “ensure the safety and well-
being” of Kashmiris.
In Uttar Pradesh, a Muslim restaurant worker was shot dead and another injured
on April 23. The attackers, declaring themselves members of a Hindu group,
released a video claiming responsibility and saying “I swear on Mother India that I
will avenge the 26 with 2,600 of them.” (The state’s police, however, said the killing
was related to a dispute over food.)
In Karnataka, another Muslim man was lynched for chanting pro-Pakistan slogans,
according to local news reports.
The most sweeping action has come in Gujarat.
On Monday, the state’s police chief said his officers had arrested 6,500 “suspected
Bangladeshi citizens.” Videos of the detention drive showed the men being moved
through the streets inside cordons of ropes.
In an indication of how indiscriminate the arrests were, the police chief said that
only 450 of the detainees had so far been found to be illegal immigrants from
Bangladesh.
The government in Gujarat also announced a demolition drive at a Muslim slum
near a lake, showing drone footage of bulldozers and dump trucks lined up for an
operation that it said involved more than 2,000 police officers. By Tuesday evening,
the state’s home minister, Harsh Sanghavi, said that about 2,000 huts had been
razed in a drive against “illegal Bangladeshis.”
Harsh Mander, a social activist, said that painting Indian Muslims as
“Bangladeshi” was an old trope used by Mr. Modi’s party.
Court petitions by residents asking for a pause were denied on Tuesday, as the
government had made a national security argument.
The petitioners argued that they were citizens of India with documentation and
had lived in the area for decades. They acknowledged that the demolitions had
taken place in an area the government claimed was public land, but said they had
happened without prior notice or due process.
Petitioners in the Gujarati city of Ahmedabad said that those detained had been
subjected to “custodial violence, atrocities and humiliation,” despite police soon
realizing that “more than 90 percent of those who are detained” were Indian
citizens.
The actions against Muslims, Mr. Mander said, “are all signs of what the state is
doing to use its power and authority in ways that are unlawful and unconstitutional
against a particular community.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/asia/india-muslims-detentions-demolitions.html
Matina Stevis-Gridneff,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,Mark Carney Has to Deliver on Trump and the Economy After Canada Election Win,"Canada’s banker-turned-prime-minister pulled off a political miracle, leading his
party from polling abyss to a rare fourth term in power, and securing the top
government job after entering electoral politics just three months ago.
Mark Carney, the country’s new leader, told Canadians that he was the right person
to stand up to President Trump and that, with his economics expertise, he knew
how to boost the country’s lackluster economy and fortify it in turbulent times.
Now he has to actually do all of that, and quickly, as his country moves from a
prolonged period of political turmoil and faces the fallout of a trade war with its
closest ally and economic  partner: the United States.

Mess at Home
When Mr. Carney’s predecessor, Justin Trudeau, announced in January that he
would resign after 10 years leading Canada, he created a rare opportunity that Mr.
Carney jumped at.
But after Mr. Carney won the race to replace Mr. Trudeau in March as prime
minister and leader of the Liberal Party, he also inherited a messy situation at
home that he must now urgently take on.
The Canadian Parliament has not been in session since before Christmas, after Mr.
Trudeau suspended its activities to be able to hold the Liberal leadership election
that elevated Mr. Carney.
As a result, the country has been in a state of political instability for months with no
ability to pursue a legislative agenda.
And Mr. Carney doesn’t yet have his own cabinet — he made small changes to the
one he inherited from Mr. Trudeau, but he is likely to put his personal stamp on the
government by choosing top ministers now that he’s won the national elections.
Justin Trudeau walks away from a lectern after announcing his intention to resign as

What’s more, the Liberals did not manage to clinch a majority of seats in the House
of Commons and will need to court three members from smaller parties to get their
policies passed in the 343-seat chamber.  
Mr. Carney will need to move swiftly to win the necessary parliamentary allies and
ensure the stability of his party while keeping it from becoming vulnerable to
collapsing through a vote of no confidence, which would trigger new elections.

“The first order of business is getting a cabinet and getting Parliament back as

“We need to see the prime minister come in and quickly move into lawmaking,” Mr.
Holmes said. “There is no honeymoon for this prime minister.”

Stability now
A key pitch to Canadians that worked in Mr. Carney’s favor at the ballot box was
that he was exactly the right leader to navigate the reordering of global trade and
security prompted by Mr. Trump.
Mr. Carney’s past experience leading major institutions through upheaval,
including the Bank of England through Brexit, were key in convincing many
Canadians who backed him that his credentials were aligned for the challenges
Canada faces.
Canadian businesses are looking to Mr. Carney to restore a sense of order to
commerce with the United States. Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Canadian goods have been
a moving target, with the administration pulling back on some levies, while
applying new ones, with no sense of a coherent economic rationale.  The result has
been a halt to private sector investment in Canada, Mr. Holmes said. Mr. Carney
should address that immediately, he said.
“Capital is frozen and paralyzed watching the trade war play out and not knowing
what the future is going to be,” Mr. Holmes said. “He needs to inject certainty in
that.”
Anti-Trump
Mr. Carney’s framing of his campaign around Mr. Trump’s threats to Canada has
elevated him to a global anti-Trump figure. He is the first major leader to be elected
on an explicitly anti-Trump campaign since Mr. Trump’s re-election.
“As I’ve been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our
water,” Mr. Carney told supporters gathered in Ottawa, Canada’s capital, in the
early hours Tuesday to celebrate his victory. “President Trump is trying to break us
so he can own us. That will never happen,” he added as the crowd booed.
Later on Tuesday, the two men spoke by phone, their offices said, and agreed to
meet soon.
Mr. Carney’s fiery rhetoric could prove a problem if the two leaders do talk in
person. Mr. Carney has said he wants to gain Mr. Trump’s respect, while also being
open to discussions about what the future relationship between the two countries
on various issues, including trade and security, will look like.
“There is an appetite in the West to find an anti-Trump figure to take up the mantle
of leader of the free world,” said Stephen Wertheim, a senior fellow at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace. “I think that’s a hazardous proposition.”
“The minute the media starts hyping a foreign leader as the hand of global anti-
Trump resistance, that will put a target on that leader’s back,” Mr. Wertheim added. 
Mr. Carney is likely to strike a more nuanced tone behind closed doors with Mr.
Trump, but the Canadian public will be looking for the defiance and pride that he
promised on the campaign trail.
And the fact remains that the United States has imposed tariffs on key Canadian
sectors, like the auto industry, and that Mr. Trump continues to regularly say he
wants Canada to become the 51st state, including on Canada’s Election Day.
Mr. Wertheim said Mr. Carney should ignore the threats and focus on striking a
deal. “I think Carney shouldn’t get too fixated on the annexation threat,” he said. “If
Trump makes one, it will probably be half a joke, and Carney should dish it right
back and smile.”
Playing Host
An early test of Mr. Carney’s ability to manage dealing with Mr. Trump will take
place when he hosts the summit of the Group of 7 industrialized economies leaders
in Kananaskis, Alberta, in June.
Mr. Trump is expected to attend, and will find himself among America’s closest
allies, all of whom have been hit with U.S. tariffs.
Mr. Carney, on the contrary, will be among friends, in his own backyard. He has a
personal relationship with President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime
Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, and is seeking to negotiate a military spending  
deal with Ursula von der Leyen, the top European Union official.
It is unclear what, if anything, will be decided at the summit since global
gatherings like these tend to be about coordinating policy at a higher level rather
than yielding anything specific.
Still, there is a small margin for error. The last time Mr. Trump attended a G7
summit in Canada, he had a blowup with Mr. Trudeau, left without signing an
anodyne joint communiqué, and then called Mr. Trudeau “two-faced.”
Mr. Carney will need to closely stage-manage the event to try to prevent any
unpleasantries.
“The G7 leaders’ summit in June will really shape the early assessment of his
success,” Mr. Holmes said. “This is what he campaigned on, that he can handle a
very complex geopolitical international situation.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/canada/canada-election-carney-trump.html
Jonathan Wolfe;José Bautista,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,Power Outage in Spain and Portugal Creates a Day of Confusion,"Rocio Vilaplana, a dentist in southeastern Spain, was closing a suture in a patient’s
mouth during oral surgery early Monday afternoon when the lights went out.
“Everything started beeping,” Ms. Vilaplana said.
Her backup generator kicked in, the emergency lights in her surgery room
flickered on and the 36-year-old dentist tried to remain calm. “Let’s just close it
properly,” she thought to herself.
Dr. Vilaplana finished the delicate procedure, but it would be the beginning of a day
of frayed nerves and widespread confusion across Spain and Portugal, as a daylong
power outage brought life to a standstill for tens of millions. People spent the night
in train stations huddled under blankets, stuck in their apartments without water
or working elevators, staring at their suddenly useless cellphones and wondering
what had happened.
With electricity almost entirely restored in the two countries — though the
authorities in Spain and Portugal were still searching for the cause of the outage —
many people reflected on the anxiety of being left not only without power, but also
Stuck in a Dentist’s Chair, and Other Blackout

without cellphone service, internet access or the ability to pay for anything except
with cash.
In Murcia, a city in southeastern Spain, the word on many residents’ lips on
Tuesday was “locura” — insanity.
“The worst was the lack of communication,” said María José Egea, 71, who spent a
nervous evening in her seventh-floor apartment, the elevator out of service.
Neighbors came to check in on her, she said, although good information was scarce
and rumors about the cause of the blackout flew.

Madrid. Oscar Del Pozo/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images
“People were coming and telling me nonsense,” she said. “Everyone had a theory. ”
In the Spanish capital, Madrid, residents in the Arganzuela neighborhood filtered
into the streets on Monday, confused by what was happening. Some stared at their
unconnected phones.  Others gathered outside health centers, shops and bars to
try to gather information.
A small crowd collected at an auto repair shop on Martín de Vargas Street, where
the owner, Fernando Palacio, opened the doors of a car he was working on and
played a news broadcast on the radio — the only reliable source of information
throughout the day.
It reminded Mr. Palacio of a 1981 coup attempt in Spain, he said Tuesday morning,
with “everyone glued to the radio.”
Naturally, people flocked to the stores that were still open to buy batteries, cooking
charcoal, toilet paper and other essentials. By nightfall, some store shelves in cities
like Murcia were empty.
“We were actually quite scared,” said María Cantero, 41, a restaurant server in
Archena, about 15 miles outside Murcia. She made a run to the store to buy formula
for her 5-month-old daughter and candles. As night fell and the power was still out,
she felt uneasy.
In Peniche, Portugal, about 60 miles north of Lisbon, José Boto, a 69-year-old
pensioner, had a tough day.
He was standing in line at a supermarket, holding a chicken — his lunch — when
he was told there had been a power outage and that payment could only be made in
cash. “I had to leave the chicken behind,” he said.

By Tuesday morning, life was regaining its rhythms. Ms. Cantero drove her
daughter, Lucía, to a doctor’s appointment in Murcia. The traffic lights were
working again, and the police officers who had deployed to intersections to direct
traffic a day earlier were gone.
The Spanish capital was not quite back to its bustling self. Many residents
appeared to be staying home. Schools were open, although few were holding
regular classes.
María del Carmen Sánchez, a caretaker at Cervantes Secondary School in the
Lavapiés neighborhood of Madrid, said that “barely 5 percent of the students”
showed up on Tuesday.
Still, she said, despite “the chaos of the situation, I think everything went quite
well. People were very patient, although there were some nerves and concern at
first.”
For others, the disruptions of the previous day lingered.
Anthony Saas, 24, a student from Zgharta, Lebanon, was stranded in the southern
Spanish city of Córdoba on Monday after his train home to Jaén, where he is
studying, was canceled. He spent a sleepless night at the train station, covered by a
Red Cross blanket, and he was still there on Tuesday morning, holding a plastic bag
with his belongings and waiting for his rescheduled train home to be announced.
“It was a tough night,” Mr. Saas said. It was his first visit to Córdoba, he added,
“and I don’t even know if I will ever come back.”
As the authorities continued to search for the cause of the blackout, many across
the region prepared for several days of digging out.
At her dental clinic in Murcia, Dr. Vilaplana donned her scrubs and mask again on
Tuesday morning. She was planning to work up to 13 hours to try to fit in all of her
canceled patients and attend to new emergencies.
For the next few days, she said, “it’s going to be completely crazy.”

Matina Stevis-Gridneff,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,Canada Election Results: Mark Carney and the Liberal Party Fall Short of Majority,"Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada and his Liberal Party narrowly failed to
win a majority of seats in Parliament in Monday’s election, and will need help from
smaller parties to pass legislation and pursue a challenging agenda, including
confronting President Trump’s economic and sovereignty threats.
With final results coming in on Tuesday from nearly all districts a day after polls
closed, the Liberals secured 169 seats in the 343-member Parliament, just three shy
of a majority, according to Elections Canada, the independent body that manages
the country’s elections. The Conservative Party won 144 seats.
The result was still a resounding success for a Liberal Party that three months ago
was predicted to lose badly to the Conservative opposition and for Mr. Carney, who
had never run for any elected office before Monday. It grants the Liberals a rare
fourth consecutive term in government.
Canada’s Liberals Narrowly Miss Out on
Majority in Parliament

While a majority government would have allowed Mr. Carney to push through his
policies without needing to rely on others in Parliament, the task of securing
support from other members to pass laws and budgets did not appear too taxing —
the Liberals have governed without a majority over two terms, for the last 5 and ½
years. Small parties like the Greens and the leftist New Democrats are more
naturally aligned with the Liberals’ center-left political platform.
The Conservative Party had been handily leading in polls until March when Mr.
Trump’s tariffs on Canadian goods took effect and Mr. Carney replaced Justin
Trudeau as prime minister and the leader of the Liberals. For the Conservative
leader, Pierre Poilievre, the party’s stinging defeat was made worse by the fact that
he lost his seat, which he had held for 20 years, to a Liberal candidate.
Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative leader, on Monday night. He lost his own seat in the House of

The election has been extraordinary in many ways, with candidates and many
voters describing it as the most critical vote in their lifetimes.
It was dominated by Mr. Trump and his relentless focus on Canada, America’s
closest ally and trading partner. He imposed tariffs on Canadian goods, including
autos, steel and aluminum, pushing the country toward a recession, and repeatedly
threatened to annex it as the 51st state. Even as Canadians were heading to the
polls on Monday, he repeated his argument on social media that making Canada
part of the United States would yield economic and military benefits.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Carney spoke Tuesday by phone, Mr. Carney’s office said in a
brief statement, adding that they would meet “in the near future.”
“President Trump congratulated Prime Minister Carney on his recent election,” the
statement said. “The leaders agreed on the importance of Canada and the United
States working together — as independent, sovereign nations — for their mutual
betterment.”
Mr. Carney, 60, a seasoned economist and policymaker who promoted himself as
the anti-Trump candidate and centered his campaign on dealing with the United
States, ultimately benefited from the American president’s actions.
Now, he is likely to be judged on how he fares in defending Canada from the
damage, including significant job losses and the hobbling of major industries, that a
prolonged trade war could cause.
In his acceptance speech early on Tuesday, Mr. Carney warned Canadians that
there would be difficult times ahead, even as he made clear that he was prepared to
protect Canada’s interests in his dealings with Mr. Trump.
“As I’ve been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our
water,” he said. “President Trump is trying to break us so he can own us. That will
never happen.”
Mr. Poilievre, 45, and the Conservatives had been dominating polls for years,
building their support around the argument that Mr. Trudeau and the Liberals had
dragged Canada into chronic economic malaise.
But they watched their double-digit lead rapidly disappear after Mr. Trump
launched his aggressive campaign against Canada and Mr. Trudeau, who had been
deeply unpopular, resigned.
Canadians heading to the polls were preoccupied both with the country’s
relationship with its neighbor to the south and with the state of the economy at
home. Affordability worries, primarily over housing, were top of mind, opinion
surveys conducted before the election showed, and seemed to boost Conservative
candidates in some districts.
But Canada’s election choice on Monday also served as a referendum of sorts on
Mr. Trump and the way he has been treating America’s allies and its trading
partners.
It was the second major international election since Mr. Trump came to power,
after Germany’s, and Canada’s handling of the rupture in the relationship with the
United States is being closely watched around the world.
The election also highlighted that Mr. Trump’s brand of politics can turn toxic for
conservatives elsewhere if they are seen as being too in sync with his ideological
and rhetorical style.
Mr. Poilievre’s repeated denunciations of “radical woke ideology” and promises to
defund Canada’s national broadcaster and cut foreign aid seemed to have cost him
centrist voters, pre-election polls suggested.
The party’s defeat and Mr. Poilievre’s loss of his own seat could set off a battle for
the Conservative leadership, though the party won more seats and a larger share
of the vote than it had in years.
For Mr. Carney, the victory marked the astonishing culmination of his rapid rise in
Canada’s political establishment since entering the race to replace Mr. Trudeau in
January.
A political novice but policy-making veteran, Mr. Carney, a former central banker,
conveyed a measured, serious tone and defiance toward Mr. Trump’s belligerence,
helping to sway many voters who had been contemplating supporting the
Conservatives, according to polls and some individual voters.
And his politics as a pragmatist and a centrist seemed to better align with Canada’s
mood after a decade of Mr. Trudeau’s progressive agenda.
In the early hours of Tuesday, amid celebrations, Mr. Carney said he was ready for
the challenge. “We will fight back with everything we have to get the best deal for
Canada,” he said. “We will build an independent future for our great country.”

In December, Mr. Colamedici’s press printed 70 copies of an Italian edition that he
supposedly translated. Still, the book quickly gained outsize attention, being
covered by media outlets in Germany, Spain, Italy and France, and being cited by
tech luminaries.
“Hypnocracy” describes how powerful people use technology to shape perception
with “hypnotic narratives,” putting the public in a kind of collective trance that may
be exacerbated by relying on A.I.
The book’s publication came as schools, businesses, governments and internet
users all over the world are wrestling with how to use — and not use — A.I. tools,
which tech giants and startups have made widely available. (The New York Times
has sued OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and its partner, Microsoft, claiming
copyright infringement of news content. The two companies have denied the suit’s
claims.)
Yet the book turned out to also be a demonstration of its thesis, playing out on
unwitting readers.
The book, Mr. Colamedici said, was meant to show the dangers of “cognitive
apathy” that could develop if thinking were delegated to machines and if people
don’t cultivate their discernment.
“I tried to create a performance, an experience that is not just the book,” he said.
Mr. Colamedici teaches what he calls “the art of prompting,” or how to ask A.I.
smart questions and give it actionable instructions, at the European Institute of
Design in Rome. He said that he often sees two extreme, if opposite, responses to
tools like ChatGPT, with many students wanting to rely on them exclusively and
many teachers thinking that A.I. is inherently wrong. He instead tries to teach
users how to discern fact from fabrication and how to engage with the tools
productively.
The book is an extension of this effort, Mr. Colamedici argued. The A.I. tools he
used helped him to refine the ideas, while clues (real and invented) about the fake
author (online and in the book), intentionally suggested potential problems to
prompt readers to ask questions, he said.
The first chapter discusses fake authorship, for example, and the book contains
obscure references to Italian culture unlikely to come from a young philosopher
from Hong Kong, which eventually helped to lead one reviewer to the true author
operating as a translator.
Sabina Minardi, an editor at the Italian outlet L’Espresso, picked up on the clues,
exposing Jianwei Xun as a fake early this month.
Mr. Colamedici then updated the fake author’s bio page and spoke to publications,
including some deceived by his work. New editions and excerpts printed this
month come with postscripts about the truth.
But some who first embraced the book now reject it and question whether Mr.
Colamedici has acted unethically or broken a European Union law about the use of
A.I.
The French news outlet Le Figaro wrote about “L’affaire Jianwei Xun,” explaining
that the “problem” with its earlier interview of the Hong Kong philosopher was that
“he doesn’t exist.”
The Spanish newspaper El País in Spain retracted a report about the book,
replacing it with a note that said “the book failed to acknowledge A.I.’s involvement
in the creation of the text, a violation of the new European AI Act.”
Article 50 of that law says that if someone uses an A.I. system to generate text for
the purposes of “informing the public on matters of public interest,” then it must
(with limited exceptions) be disclosed that generative A.I. was used, said Noah
Feldman, a law professor at Harvard University who advises tech companies.
“That provision on its face seems to cover the creator of the book and perhaps
anyone republishing its content,” he said. “The law does not go into effect until
August 2026 but it is common in the E.U. for people and institutions to want to
follow laws that seem morally good even when they don’t yet technically apply.”
Jonathan Zittrain, a law and computer science professor at Harvard, said he was
more inclined to call Mr. Colamedici’s book “a piece of performance art, or simply
marketing, that involved using a pen name.”
Mr. Colamedici is disappointed some initial champions have decried the
experiment. But he plans to keep using A.I. to demonstrate the very dangers it
raises. “This is the moment,” he said. “We are risking cognition. It’s use it or lose it.”
He said he plans to have Jianwei Xun — describing it as a collective of humans and
artificial intelligence — teach a course about A.I. next fall.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/europe/hypnocracy-ai-

Aurelien Breeden,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,French Lawmakers Cracking Down on Drug Traffickers,"French lawmakers on Tuesday widely approved a bill that cracks down on illegal
drug trafficking by empowering prosecutors, toughening the penalties for
traffickers and giving the police more investigative tools.
The move, which paves the way for the measures to become law, was a rare case of
successful policymaking in France’s lower house of Parliament, the National
Assembly. Lawmakers there have been hobbled by political fractures, but they
have joined to express growing concern over the far-reaching impact of crime and
violence tied to the drug trade.
The National Assembly approved the bill with 396 votes in favor and 68 against. Its
passage was a win for the government of Prime Minister François Bayrou, who
survived a no-confidence motion in February to pass a budget but who is still at the
mercy of the divided lower house.
“Everyone knows the current political difficulties: no majority in the National
Assembly, a complicated path for major bills,” Bruno Retailleau, France’s interior
minister, a conservative who championed the bill, told lawmakers on Tuesday.
Mr. Retailleau said that the broad support for the bill showed that lawmakers
understood that drug trafficking and organized crime were “often the root cause of
hyper-violence” in France and an “existential threat” against its institutions.
Some left-wing lawmakers expressed concern about the focus on cracking down
against drug traffickers, rather than the root causes of their trade, but only the
hard-left France Unbowed party ultimately voted against the bill. Green
lawmakers and a handful of others abstained.
Impetus for the new bill came from an alarming Senate Committee report on drug
trafficking that was published last year. It was spearheaded by a Socialist and a
member of the conservative Republican Party in a rare instance of collaboration
across the aisle.
“The impact of drug trafficking on France has exploded over the past decade,” the
report warned. It said that the police were now seizing 10 times as much cocaine as
they were a decade ago and that France’s overall drug trade was estimated to be at
least 3.5 billion euros, or nearly $4 billion.
Just last week, the police seized a 9.1-metric ton shipment of cannabis resin near
Lyon, the Paris prosecutor’s office announced on Tuesday
Shooting and arson attacks on French prisons this month have also heightened a
sense that the French authorities are facing an uphill battle against violent crime.
The justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, has suggested that the attacks were carried
out by drug traffickers to “intimidate” the state, although the identity of those
responsible is not yet clear.
The linchpin of France’s new drug trafficking measures, which were inspired in
part by Italy’s anti-mafia efforts, is the creation a national prosecutor’s office
dedicated to coordinating organized crime cases  It is expected to be operational by
2026, and will focus on the most complex and prominent drug-trafficking
investigations.
The bill alsomakes it easier to seize the assets of drug traffickers, and allows the
police to document some information about investigations — like how a wiretap
was conducted — in separate case files that are not accessible to the lawyers of
drug-trafficking suspects. That change is intended to avoid leaks that could
endanger the lives of investigators or informants, but it has infuriated defense
lawyers, who say it violates the right to a fair trial.
The bill also drastically toughens the treatment of inmates regarded as particularly
dangerous. It creates special high-security units for the most prominent drug
traffickers to minimize outside contact, banning some family visits and using more
videoconferencing to reduce the number of in-person court hearings.
Some of the measures seemed tailor-made for one of France’s most notorious
criminals, Mohamed Amra. who was freed last year in a ruthless ambush on a
prison convoy that left two guards dead on a major highway.
The attack shocked the country and focused attention on violence tied to the drug
trade. Mr. Amra, who was taken back into custody in Romania in February after a
nine-month manhunt, had juggled cellphones from behind bars to run schemes that
included drug trafficking and kidnappings, raising uncomfortable questions about
whether the authorities had underestimated him.
The rare critics of the bill just passed in Parliament argued that several of its
measures were redundant and that the measure did not give the police the funding
needed to tackle complex and time-consuming drug investigations.
“We still believe that this bill will be, for the most part, inefficient,” Ugo Bernalicis,
a France Unbowed lawmaker, told the lower house on Tuesday.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/europe/french-lawmakers-

James Wagner,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,"No Evidence of Cremations at Mexican Ranch, Attorney General Says","An abandoned ranch in western Mexico that groups searching for missing relatives
had claimed was an “extermination camp” — because of discarded personal items
and burned remains found there — was a training hub for a major cartel, Mexico’s
attorney general announced on Tuesday. But, he said “there is not a single piece of
evidence to prove” that the ranch was the site of human cremations.
At a news conference presenting his office’s findings so far in the high-profile case,
Attorney General Alejandro Gertz said that the Izaguirre ranch in Teuchitlán, a
village near Guadalajara in Jalisco state, was “totally proven” to have been used as
a recruitment, training and operations center by the Jalisco New Generation
Cartel, one of the most violent criminal organizations in the country. He said that
conclusion was based on testimonials and documents.
But in a departure from previous comments, Mr. Gertz insisted that there was no
proof of cremations at the ranch.
Mr. Gertz said a container of very small bone fragments was found by the
authorities who originally discovered the ranch in September. He said that studies
conducted by a Mexico City university on evidence, dirt and other materials did not
find heat levels over 200 degrees Celsius. Cremations, he said, require levels in
excess of 800 degrees.
Earlier this month, Mr. Gertz said that investigators had not found evidence of
crematories at the ranch, but that some human remains found there had “traces of
some type of cremation.” And Mexico’s security minister, Omar García Harfuch,
said last month that, based on a detained person’s testimony, the cartel went as far
as killing those who resisted training or tried to escape.

On Tuesday, Mr. Gertz said that, beyond the one body found by the authorities in
September, when the National Guard exchanged fire with people at the ranch,
investigators had not found more bodies or bones.
The ditches and holes in the ground — which a search group had believed to be
cremation ovens — were bonfires, Mr. Gertz said.
Héctor Flores, a leader of a search group in Jalisco state, said in a phone interview
that search groups still believed that the ranch had been an extermination site and
that people had been cremated there given what they found last month. He said
that officials were using technical language in an effort to change the narrative.
“The government can call it whatever it wants, but I think Mexican society is
mature enough and aware of this whole Izaguirre topic to not believe the lies of the
federal government,” he said.
Mr. Gertz said that authorities had no idea how many people may have been
recruited or disappeared at the ranch. He said the forensic team was still studying
the bone fragments to identify them, a task that has been complicated by their
small size.
Multiple times on Tuesday, Mr. Gertz reminded the public that the investigation
was ongoing and that his office has only had control of the case since late March,
when President Claudia Sheinbaum asked him to take over.
After a group of volunteers searching for their missing relatives received a tip in
early March about a possible mass grave hidden in western Mexico, photos of
heaps of shoes and clothes shocked a country already scarred by many episodes of
brutal violence and clandestine graves.
More than 120,000 people have gone missing in Mexico since the country began
keeping track in 1962, according to official data. More than 15,000 have gone
missing in the state of Jalisco, with many of the cases believed to be linked to the
Jalisco New Generation Cartel.
Last month, Mr. Gertz criticized the investigation carried out by local authorities
and said it had been riddled with irregularities. Local officials failed to secure the
site after it was first located in September, and it was abandoned until the search
group came along last month.
On Tuesday, Mr. Gertz said that a state human rights commission in Jalisco told
local authorities in 2021 of illicit activities at the ranch “but they did nothing.”
Among the 14 people currently detained in connection with the case, Mr. Gertz said
there are three local police officers, including a police chief, as well as a person
whom the authorities have identified as a cartel leader who oversaw the training
center.
“We’re going to go after those who were covering up or participating in” the cartel’s
operations at the ranch, Mr. Gertz said, noting that this included public officials. He
also said that his office was investigating other possible “narco-ranches” in the
area.
As far as the bags of clothes that were found at the ranch — but that have not been
studied by local authorities — Mr. Gertz said that he did not know whom they
belonged to. But he said that federal investigators planned to work with search
groups to help identify the items and then perhaps link them to their owners
through forensic tests.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/americas/mexico-

Jason Horowitz;Patricia Mazzei,NYT,1,World,5/3/2025,"Cardinal Parolin, Leader of Papal Conclave, Is Also a Top Candidate","In the days surrounding Pope Francis’ death, Cardinal Pietro Parolin was
everywhere.
The No. 2 figure in the Vatican, he visited Francis in the hospital, and then helped
seal the papal apartments after the pope died. He welcomed cardinals he knew
from around the world to the pope’s funeral, talking to former President Joseph R.
Biden Jr., President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and former Prime Minister
Matteo Renzi of Italy. And leading up to the conclave to pick the next pope, he
celebrated an outdoor Mass for tens of thousands of faithful on the steps of St.
Peter’s Basilica.

It seems that everyone knows Cardinal Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state, who
will preside over the papal election and who has emerged as the leading
compromise candidate before a conclave in which many of the more than 130
cardinals do not know one another.
“The only candidate that for now has emerged with a certain insistence is Parolin,”
said Andrea Riccardi, the founder of the Sant’Egidio Community, a Catholic group
close to Francis. “He represents a continuity,” added Mr. Riccardi, who is close to
several cardinals who are considered papal contenders. “He has said, ‘Virtue
stands in the middle.’”
A quiet, plodding Italian with a famously inscrutable poker face, Cardinal Parolin is
deeply cautious. But at a time of global upheaval, that is not necessarily a
disqualifier. Even his backers grant that he lacks Francis’ charisma and global
symbolism — but as the leader of the Vatican machinery for the past decade, he
enacted Francis’ vision.

Square in Vatican City after Pope Francis’ death. Damien Meyer/Agence France-Presse — Getty

Cardinals have talked about Cardinal Parolin as someone who could have a steady,
bureaucratic hand on the church’s wheel. And at 70, he could appeal to cardinals
who do not want to be stuck too long with the winner.
His critics on the left question his past comments about same-sex marriage, which
he called a “defeat for humanity,” and his lack of pastoral experience. His critics on
the right criticize his role in the church’s efforts to make inroads in China, which
has required negotiations with Communist leaders.
But few prelates who know him have strong feelings about him either way. And
after the eventful and, for some, divisive dozen years under Francis, bland but
competent may be just what the cardinals are looking for.
On migration, for example, whereas Francis excoriated the inhumanity of great
powers turning the Mediterranean into a graveyard, Cardinal Parolin said after a
meeting with Italy’s right-wing prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, that immigration
was “a very, very complex subject.”
Some have drawn parallels to the conclave of 1939. With authoritarianism rising
and the world order endangered, those cardinals elected Eugenio Pacelli, a Vatican
secretary of state who had served as envoy to Germany in the 1920s during the
Nazis’ rise. Historians are still divided over whether he, as Pius XII, took an overly
diplomatic approach.
And within the church, some liberal Catholics have questioned whether a measured
bureaucrat without deep pastoral experience is what the church needs to keep
Francis’ inclusive momentum going.

was rising. Agence France-Presse — Getty Images
Cardinal Parolin grew up in Schiavon, a small town in the northern Italian region of
Veneto that is known as a cradle of popes.
He was raised by his mother, an elementary school teacher, after his father, who
owned a hardware store, died in a car accident when the boy was 10.
He entered the minor seminary at 14 and was ordained at 25. But Cardinal Parolin’s
career was not on the path of being a pastor, or a diocesan priest. He entered the
Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in Rome, which trains priests to serve in the
diplomatic corps.
In the 1980s, he was stationed in Nigeria during military coups and a civil war.
Later, he worked in Mexico to restore diplomatic ties. In 1992, he returned to the
Vatican, where he joined the powerful Secretariat of State and served on the Italy
desk. He later became the director of the Villa Nazareth school for promising
students with poor backgrounds, forming connections to young people who would
later join Italy’s elite.
But he also acquired baggage on the way.
In 2002, under John Paul II, Cardinal Parolin became the Vatican’s second most
important diplomat, focusing on Vietnam, where he helped normalize relations, and
on China, which for many in the church is the great challenge of the coming
century.
In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI tried reconciliation with China, which required its
bishops to be loyal to the country’s government rather than to Rome. He chose
Cardinal Parolin, who was then an archbishop, to lead the talks over bishops in
state-sanctioned churches. The talks stalled.
In 2009, Benedict gave Cardinal Parolin another difficult assignment, as the
Vatican’s ambassador to Venezuela, where prelates were in a tense standoff with
Hugo Chávez’s leftist government.
Cardinal Parolin said after meeting with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy that
immigration was “a very, very complex subject.” Andrew Medichini/Associated Press
The cardinal’s charge in Venezuela was more political than theological, and he
employed a style that he would later call “positive neutrality” to press church
interests without taking sides between the government and the opposition.
Venezuelans credited Cardinal Parolin — who speaks English, French and near-
fluent Spanish with a slight Italian lilt — with easing tensions between the
government and the church. It helped that his approach to diplomacy was rather
deliberate and discreet, his supporters have said.
His diplomatic focus under Francis extended to the war in Ukraine and relations
with Russia and the United States. But China was again a major agenda item as
Francis tried anew to improve relations.
Cardinal Parolin helped strike a groundbreaking deal in 2018 that amounted to the
first formal recognition of the pope’s authority within the church in China.
Conservatives considered it a betrayal for Francis to recognize bishops appointed
by the Chinese government who had been previously excommunicated. Sharing
any church authority, conservatives argued, created dangerous conditions for the
millions of Chinese Catholics who worshiped in underground churches loyal to the
pope.
But Francis, and Cardinal Parolin, said it was worth it.
The church had an “attitude of hope, openness and dialogue that we want to
continue on both sides,” Cardinal Parolin said in 2023. All the church asked from
China, he said, was that “Catholics can be Catholics.”
Perhaps the ultimate sign of Cardinal Parolin’s strength headed into the conclave is
an apparent effort to stop him.
American right-wing Catholic publications reported in the days before the papal
election that he had fainted during one of the general congregation meetings. The
incident never occurred, said Matteo Bruni, the Vatican spokesman.
“It’s not true,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/world/europe/pope-conclave-cardinal-pietro-parolin.html
Mark Landler,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,King Charles Issues Message of Support to Fellow Cancer Patients,"King Charles III said on Wednesday that his life with cancer had brought “into
sharp focus the very best of humanity” as he expressed gratitude to medical staff
and charities that work with cancer patients across Britain.
His reflections, delivered in the form of a written message to guests attending a
reception for cancer care charities at Buckingham Palace, opened a small window
into his experiences as a patient, although he did not give any update on his
condition.
The king announced in February 2024 that he had received a diagnosis that he had
an undisclosed form of cancer, and he has been undergoing weekly treatments
since then.
“Each diagnosis, each new case, will be a daunting and at times frightening
experience for those individuals and their loved ones,” the monarch said in his
statement.
“But as one among those statistics myself, I can vouch for the fact that it can also
be an experience that brings into sharp focus the very best of humanity.”
Charles, 76, has soldiered through his illness with no public complaint and very
little discussion. And while he has spoken in elegiac tones about the time he has left
on the throne, he has offered no guidance about how long that might be.
He said that his diagnosis had given him “an even deeper appreciation of the
extraordinary work” undertaken by the charities and individuals attending the
palace reception on Wednesday night, which included Macmillan Cancer Support
and a children’s hospice.
He had visited many of the organizations in previous years, he said, in his role as a
royal patron. “And it has reinforced what I have long observed during these visits
— that the darkest moments of illness can be illuminated by the greatest
compassion,” he added.
Worries about Charles flared last month when he was briefly hospitalized after
suffering side effects from his treatment. The palace characterized it as the “most
minor bump in a road that is very much heading in the right direction.”
The king has returned to an active schedule in recent months, including regular
foreign and domestic travel. This month, Charles and his wife, Queen Camilla, flew
to Rome for a four-day state visit to Italy, during which the king gave a well-
received address to the Italian Parliament, sprinkled liberally with Italian phrases.
The couple also paid an unexpected visit to Pope Francis at the Vatican, just 13
days before he died.
Charles’s reticence about discussing his illness or treatment is in contrast to his
daughter-in-law, Catherine, the Princess of Wales, who confirmed that she, too, had
been diagnosed with cancer a year ago in a recorded video.
Although she has not disclosed what kind of cancer she had, she marked the end of
her chemotherapy treatment in September with a highly personal video that
offered home-movie-style glimpses of her with her husband, Prince William, and
their three children.
Charles ended his message by recalling the words of Deborah James, a British
podcaster and writer who chronicled her struggle with bowel cancer and
campaigned for better awareness of the illness, and who died in 2022.
The king said that for those people receiving the news of a diagnosis “today,
tomorrow or at any point in the future,” he could “only echo” the words of Ms.
James, whose parents were attending the reception.
“Find a life worth enjoying,” he said, quoting Ms. James. “Take risks; love deeply;
have no regrets; and always, always have rebellious hope.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/europe/king-charles-cancer-

Vivian Wang,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,A U.S. Businessman Is Sentenced to 5 Years in Prison in China,"A Chinese-born American businessman was sentenced last week to five years in
prison in China, on charges related to a criminal case nearly 25 years ago, despite
having frequently made routine trips in and out of the country after the fact.
The businessman’s family, as well as a longtime human rights activist, say the case
is an example of the arbitrary nature of law enforcement in China. They have urged
the Chinese government to release the businessman, David Lee, on humanitarian
parole, noting that he had been hospitalized for 10 days and that they believed he
had suffered a stroke.
Mr. Lee’s sentencing on April 23 came as tensions between the United States and
China were at their highest point in years, inflamed by President Trump’s tariffs.
There were no signs that the case was related to the tensions, but it could add
another source of friction to the relationship.
Mr. Lee was found guilty of intentional injury and “picking quarrels and provoking
trouble,” a vague charge that China often uses against people it perceives as a
threat to social stability. In the written verdict, the judge said that Mr. Lee, 61, had
been involved in three altercations in 2000 and 2001, one of which led to a man’s
death.
But the family of Mr. Lee, who held a green card at the time and became an
American citizen in 2002, said his role in those incidents was minor. He was briefly
detained then released without charges, and he assumed the case was closed, his
wife, Louise Lin, said. Over the next two decades, he traveled to China nearly every
month for his work as a wholesale lighting supplier for Home Depot.
Mr. Lee sometimes spent months at a time in China with no issue, Ms. Lin said. “If
you know you’re in trouble, of course you’re not going to go back,” said Ms. Lin,
who lives in California.
He often returned to Hebei Province, where he grew up. That was also where he
was abruptly arrested in the elevator bank of his hotel last April, while going to
breakfast with Ms. Lin, she said. She said she did not know why Mr. Lee was being
targeted.
Ms. Lin has not been able to see her husband since he was detained, except for
once briefly when he appeared in court, she said. But she had heard from
representatives of the United States Embassy, who were allowed to visit him, that
he was in poor health and appeared to have lost around 50 pounds.
John Kamm, the founder of the Dui Hua Foundation, a California-based
organization that works to free political prisoners in China, said that Mr. Lee should
have been released on humanitarian grounds, as China has done in the past, when
a person is at risk of dying.
He argued that the sentence was too heavy, and reflected the “appalling state of
U.S.-China relations.” He noted that Mr. Lee was arrested while the White House
and the Chinese government were negotiating the releases of other American
prisoners.
Reached by phone, the judge in the case, Lin Sen, declined to comment. The
Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The United
States Embassy in Beijing declined to comment.
The main incident in the case took place in March 2001, in Mr. Lee’s hometown,
Baoding, in Hebei. According to the indictment, Mr. Lee, after learning of a
business dispute involving an acquaintance, drove three people to the site of the
dispute, where they began fighting with another group, using knives taken from
the trunk of Mr. Lee’s car. One of the men in the opposing group was stabbed and
died. Then Mr. Lee and his acquaintances drove away.
The people whom Mr. Lee drove were sentenced to prison. Mr. Lee, according to
the verdict, said that he had not gotten out of the car. Other witnesses said the
same.
In the United States, people convicted of driving getaway cars have been charged
with murder and received prison sentences ranging from a few years to life.
The judge in China said he sentenced Mr. Lee more lightly because he was an
accessory rather than a direct participant in the violence. Ms. Lin acknowledged
that, since her husband had driven the car, she would have accepted a short prison
sentence. But she thought five years was excessive.
The police detained Mr. Lee after the fight, but prosecutors did not authorize his
formal arrest, the verdict said. He was “released on guarantee,” a form of bail.
(Under Chinese law, criminal suspects must be released after 35 days if
investigators have not gathered enough evidence to press charges. But the
investigation can remain open.)
About a month later, Mr. Lee flew to the United States.
The court accused Mr. Lee of jumping bail, but Ms. Lin said that her husband had
not been aware of any travel restrictions. She noted that he had not been formally
arrested, and that he started returning regularly to China around 2004 or 2005,
without incident.
His lawyers have filed an appeal.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/asia/american-businessman-

Stephen Castle,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,U.K. Joins U.S. in Strike Against Houthis in Yemen,"Britain’s military carried out a joint operation with U.S. forces against the Houthi
militia in Yemen, officials said on Wednesday, in the first such strike since
President Trump re-entered the White House and stepped up attacks on the Iran-
backed group.
There was no immediate comment from the American military about the operation,
which the British Defense Ministry said early Wednesday was carried out
overnight “to degrade Houthi capabilities and prevent further attacks against U.K.
and international shipping.”
Typhoon jets using precision guided bombs took part in the mission, the ministry
said in a statement, adding that the strike took place “after dark” to minimize the
risk to civilians. The target was “a cluster of buildings, used by the Houthis to
manufacture drones of the type used to attack ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of
Aden, located some 15 miles south of Sana,” the statement added, referring to the
Yemeni capital.
Britain Joins U.S. in Strike Against Houthis in
Yemen
Speaking in Parliament, the British defense secretary, John Healey, said that the
planned targets “were all successfully hit and we have seen no evidence of civilian
casualties.”
The joint operation on Tuesday came after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used
the unclassified Signal messaging app to post sensitive details about a U.S. mission
in Yemen, raising questions about operational security and whether American
allies would be deterred from further participation.
On Wednesday, Helen Maguire, who speaks for Britain’s centrist Liberal
Democrats on defense issues, asked for assurances that security was not
compromised by the United States. Mr. Healey answered, “Our own U.K.
intelligence, our own U.K. communications systems remain secure.”
In leaked Signal messages, Mr. Hegseth strongly criticized European nations,
describing them as “freeloading” and “pathetic.” At the time, Mr. Healey
characterized the comments as a “challenge” rather than an insult, adding that on
military spending “the Americans have got a case.”  
Since the fall of 2023, the Houthis have repeatedly attacked commercial and naval
ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in a campaign that they say is in
solidarity with Palestinians under bombardment in Gaza.
Britain had taken part in joint strikes on Houthi targets ordered under President
Joseph R. Biden Jr., which began in January 2024. Mr. Healey said that Tuesday’s
operation was the first time the British had struck the group’s positions since May
of last year.
In March, Mr. Trump ordered an intensified campaign, which U.S. officials have
called “Operation Rough Rider.” American forces have since then struck more than
800 targets, the U.S. military said on Sunday.
On Wednesday Mr. Healey said that Britain was with its “closest security ally,”  at a
time when the United States was stepping up its military activities in the Red Sea.
He argued that disruption to global shipping caused by the Houthis was damaging

Andrew E. Kramer,NYT,1,World,5/2/2025,Life in Ukraine Has Become More Dangerous Since Cease-Fire Talks Began,"With the beginning of cease-fire talks in the war between Russia and Ukraine, life
has become riskier for Ukrainian civilians, according to a tally of civilian deaths by
the United Nations and analysts reviewing recent Russian strikes.
Since the talks began in February, Russian missile and drone strikes and fighting
along the front line have killed far more civilians than over the same period a year
ago, U.N. officials said in a presentation for diplomats in New York this week. In the
first 24 days of April, for example, 848 civilians were killed or wounded, a 46
percent increase over the same period last year, the U.N. said.
At the same time, Russia has been targeting cities more intensively — just last
month hitting a playground, pedestrians on a crowded sidewalk and an apartment
building — an analysis of recent strikes shows. In the fighting on the ground,

Has Become More Dangerous, U.N. Says

Russia opened a new offensive in the north, east and south, Ukraine’s top military
commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, said on April 9.
On March 11, Ukraine launched on Moscow its largest drone assault of the entire
war — the morning of the day it agreed to a cease-fire. The barrage killed three
people and wounded 18 others in the Russian capital and nearby, the Russian
authorities said.
Overall, the first months of this year coinciding with the Trump administration’s
peace talks have clocked in as far deadlier than the same period last year,
according to the United Nations.

Analysts say an increase in violence during cease-fire talks is not unusual in wars.
When talks are underway in conflicts, they say, warring armies tend to jockey for
advantage before a truce halts the fighting. The result can be more casualties,
particularly in Ukraine as flurries of strikes overwhelm air defenses.
“If there is going to be a moment when they cannot pursue military action, you
expect armies to get in whatever blows they want before they have to stop,”
Samuel Charap, a Russia analyst at the RAND Corporation, said in a phone
interview. “I don’t think an increase in attacks necessarily means rejection of the
negotiating process.”
In 2014 and 2015, Russia escalated military action sharply in Ukraine before or
during cease-fire talks, capturing the eastern towns of Ilovaisk and Debaltseve to
force political terms on Kyiv. “There are things militaries want to achieve before a
potential cessation of hostilities,” Mr. Charap said.
The new run of attacks has put Ukrainians on edge. Olena Khirkovska, 57, an
accountant whose apartment was destroyed in a Russian missile strike in Kyiv on
April 24, said the strikes seemed intended to frighten Ukrainians into accepting an
unfavorable deal.
“We are strong, fear us,” was the message of the attacks, she said, adding, “It feels
like they don’t want peace at all” while engaging in negotiations.
President Trump began the cease-fire talks on Feb. 12 with phone calls to President
Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Since
then, the Trump administration has pursued separate rounds of negotiations with
Ukrainian and Russian officials.
During talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11, Ukraine agreed to the U.S.
proposal for an unconditional, 30-day cease-fire. Later in March, Russia and
Ukraine agreed to a limited truce covering strikes on energy infrastructure, but
each accused the other of violating that.
Emergency workers clearing rubble and searching for victims at the site of a Russian missile strike in

Russia offered a 30-hour cease-fire on Easter Sunday, and Ukraine accepted. Again,
each side accused the other of violations but acknowledged that violence declined
during the truce.
Mr. Putin has proposed a three-day cease-fire next week for the 80th anniversary
of the end of World War II.
Vice President JD Vance in an interview on Thursday with Fox News suggested a
drawn-out timeline for talks stretching into the summer. The war, Mr. Vance said,
would not end “any time soon.” Russia and Ukraine, he said, had laid out their
terms for a settlement. “We’re going to work very hard over the next 100 days to
try to bring these guys together,” Mr. Vance said.
The pace of Russian missile and drone attacks rose after Mr. Trump’s phone call in
February with the two leaders, an analysis of Ukrainian air force reports shows. In
the 30 days that followed the calls, Russia launched 4,694 missiles and drones at
Ukraine, compared with 1,873 in the 30 days before the calls.
After the bombardment of Kyiv that pancaked an apartment building, Mr. Trump
wrote in a social media post of Mr. Putin, “it makes me think that maybe he doesn’t
want to stop the war.”
It is not clear that the increase in attacks is linked to the talks. Russia has for
months been ramping up exploding drone assaults after a factory producing the
most common model, an Iranian-designed drone called a Shahed, came online last
year, said Mark F. Cancian, a senior analyst at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington. “That’s a reflection primarily of availability,”
he said. “They fire everything they have.”
But there was a change in Russian tactics, analysts said. Rather than striking
multiple targets throughout Ukraine, it has focused many nights on one intensive
bombardment of a single city or town.

Radislav, who was killed three days earlier when a Russian ballistic missile struck near a playground in

That tactic overwhelms Ukrainian air defenses and “results in much greater
destruction and human casualties,” said Oleksiy Melnyk, a military analyst at the
Razumkov Center, a research organization, in Kyiv. The goal, he said, is to stir
opposition to the war in Ukraine and raise “pressure on the Ukrainian
government” to accept settlement terms.
The U.N. documented more than 2,641 civilians killed or wounded in the first three
months of this year, Joyce Msuya, the U.N. assistant secretary general for
humanitarian affairs, told diplomats at the United Nations on Tuesday. That was
nearly 900 additional dead and wounded civilians in Ukraine compared with the
same period last year, she said.
The rate of civilian deaths rose further in April, coinciding with a period when U.S.
negotiators met separately with Ukrainian and Russian officials for talks.
The attacks this year have also driven about 40,000 Ukrainians from their homes,
adding to the war’s total of 10.7 million people displaced within the country.
The attacks in April included a strike that killed 35 people, many out strolling on
sidewalks on Palm Sunday in the northeastern city of Sumy, and another that killed
19, including nine children, when a missile hit a playground in the central Ukrainian
city of Kryvyi Rih.
An official in Russia’s occupation government on Thursday accused Ukraine of
hitting a market in a Russian-controlled area of Ukraine, killing seven people and
wounding 20 others. Ukraine’s military denied the claim, which was not possible to
independently verify.
The barrages continued overnight Friday. Ukrainian authorities said that Russia
launched 150 drones overnight, and that most had been shot down. A drone volley
Thursday wounded 14 people in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, the regional
governor said. On Wednesday, a volley of drones wounded 45 people, including two
children and a pregnant woman, in Kharkiv, the local authorities said.
“And so it goes every day,” Mr. Zelensky wrote on Facebook about the attacks. He
asked for nations supporting Ukraine to impose additional sanctions on Russia. “It
must be pressure, not just words or persuasion, that forces Russia to cease fire,” he
said.

Vivian Nereim;Eric Lipton,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,New Mideast Project Is Latest Trump Company Deal Tied to Foreign Government,"The Trump Organization has agreed to a new Middle East golf course and real
estate deal that involves a Qatari government-owned firm, two weeks before
President Trump is set to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates on a state visit.
The project in Qatar, a key U.S. ally and home to a major American military base, is
a partnership with Qatari Diar, a real estate company established by the country’s
sovereign wealth fund and chaired by a government minister.
New Mideast Project Is Latest Trump Company
Deal Tied to a Foreign Government

Eric Trump, the president’s son who runs the family business, traveled to the
Middle East this week to attend a cryptocurrency conference and promote the
company’s real estate developments, which include a separate Trump-branded
tower in Dubai, the largest city in the Emirates.
The two projects will also involve Dar Global, the international subsidiary of the
private Saudi real estate firm Dar Al Arkan, which is leading the project and has
close ties to the Saudi government. The Qatar project was initially reported by
Reuters.
The Trump golf course in Qatar is the most recent in a series of projects that
directly involve foreign governments. And it is just one of a growing list of ways
that the Trump family is profiting from Mr. Trump’s refreshed status after his
return to the White House, including two cryptocurrency ventures.
In Oman, the Trump family has partnered on a Dar Global hotel and golf project
that is being built on state-owned land, and the government will get a share of the
revenues generated, according to company documents. In Serbia, the Trump
family is planning a new hotel in collaboration with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s
son-in-law.
During Mr. Trump’s first term, the family held off signing international deals while
he was in office. In January, before Mr. Trump was inaugurated as president for a
second time, the Trump Organization issued a formal ethics statement that it would
have “no new transactions with foreign governments” but would pursue
international deals.
Eric Trump said in a statement on Wednesday that his family continued to honor
this pledge, as Dar Global had purchased the land from the Qatari government
entity.
“Our partners Dar purchased land from them,” Mr. Trump said, after he appeared
at a signing event with Dar Global and representatives from the Qatari
government. “We have zero relationship with them — they are there showing me
the vision of the city.”
But the Trump Organization has accelerated its international real estate deal-
making in the months since the elder Mr. Trump was re-elected, including a new
development in Vietnam.
Few places exemplify the Trump family’s fluid melding of business with politics as
clearly as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the Emirates, the three countries in the Gulf that
Mr. Trump will visit.
Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed, the deputy ruler of Abu Dhabi and the national security
adviser of the Emirates, also oversees a vast business empire and chairs G42, one
of the region’s leading artificial intelligence firms. In Qatar, the energy minister
heads its state energy company.
In Saudi Arabia, nearly every major business has ties to the state, either via
government-owned stakes in the companies or extensive government contracts.
The president will arrive in the region on May 13 and bypass the Middle East’s
traditional power centers, such as Egypt, in favor of three financial centers that
collectively manage trillions in assets via their sovereign wealth funds.
In 2017, Mr. Trump made Saudi Arabia his first foreign destination as president.
When he left office, the kingdom became a key source of new business for his
family. LIV Golf, a professional league backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund
and rival to the PGA Tour, has hosted tournaments at the Trump National Doral
Golf Club near Miami. The wealth fund has also invested $2 billion in an
investment firm that Mr. Kushner set up after he left his post as a White House
adviser during the president’s first term.
The president has said he wants to bring in $1 trillion in investment to the United
States from his trip to Saudi Arabia. But economists say that is unlikely as the
kingdom faces a cash crunch.

region. Amr Alfiky/Reuters
Dubai, where a new 80-story Trump International Hotel and Tower will overlook
the world’s tallest skyscraper, is a “developer’s playground,” Eric Trump said in an
interview on Tuesday with CNBC.
“We’re going to come in here and build a crown jewel and everybody is going to
know, that’s Trump International Hotel and Tower,” he said. “That’s Trump.”
The project will also allow purchasers to use cryptocurrency to buy properties, he
said at a Dar Global event in Dubai this week. World Liberty Financial, the Trump
family’s cryptocurrency firm, has recently negotiated deals with firms in the
region. These include the Emirates-based DWF Labs, which recently became one
of the largest known holders of the World Liberty token after investing $25 million
in the firm.
In recent years, amid slow global growth and high interest rates, state-backed
entities in the Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been some of the few reliable
sources of capital. In March, the Emirati government pledged to invest $1.4 trillion
in the United States over a decade. This week, Phil Murphy, the Democratic
governor of New Jersey, began a trip to Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and Bahrain,
seeking investment.
In most of the Trump Organization’s foreign deals, the company’s partners put up
the capital to construct the hotels, towers or golf courses. The Trump family is
effectively selling its name and brand, and typically plays a long-term role in
managing the properties.
The Trump Organization is paid a branding fee up front and annual payments
afterward for the foreign branding deals and management fees that collectively are
worth about $10 million a year, according to a 2024 financial disclosure. Mr. Trump
has turned over management of his companies to his sons, but he still benefits
financially from these foreign projects.
Zephyr Teachout, a professor of corporate and anticorruption law at Fordham Law
School in New York, was part of a team that sued Mr. Trump during his first term
for allegedly taking improper financial payments from foreign governments. The
lawsuit, which Mr. Trump’s lawyers challenged, was deemed moot by the Supreme
Court after Mr. Trump’s first term ended and before the case was decided. It has
not been refiled.
Ms. Teachout said Mr. Trump’s latest actions are even more worrisome. “It is
extremely troubling,” she said. “The Qatari government military and trade
decisions are now unavoidably a part of the broader private negotiation over a real
estate deal.”
The Qatari government did not respond to a request for comment. Qatari Diar did
not respond to calls made to its headquarters after business hours but wrote on
social media that it had partnered with Dar Global to launch Trump International
Golf Club & Villas in an oceanfront area called Simaisma. The project would offer “a
new standard of luxury living with an 18-hole golf course, exclusive clubhouse and
beachfront Trump-branded villas,” it said.
Eric Trump told The New York Times after attending a signing event for the new
deal that the golf course and villas would be “beautiful” and “right on the ocean.”
His father’s business relationships in the Gulf predate his political career. Hussain
Sajwani, the founder and chairman of DAMAC Properties of Dubai, built the first
Trump-branded golf course in the Middle East a decade ago.
The Trump family’s ties to the region have deepened since he entered politics, with
the Trump Organization announcing three real estate projects with Dar Global in
the Saudi cities of Jeddah and Riyadh last year.
The Trump Tower in Dubai will include a Trump-branded members-only club and
“the highest outdoor pool in the world,” Dar Global and the Trump Organization
said in a news release on Wednesday.
Eric Trump used his visit to Dubai to trumpet his family’s ties to the emirate and
the region. “On behalf of myself, on behalf of my family, we love Dubai, we love the
Gulf,” he said at the Dar Global event. “We have such a great relationship between
the United States and just one of the greatest places. And I’m proud to call so many
of you friends.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/middleeast/trump-family-

Vivian Yee;Hwaida Saad,NYT,1,World,5/3/2025,Druse in Syrian Town Rocked by Violence Agree to Disarm Militias,"Sirens blaring, a truckful of armed men trailing in its wake, the black sport utility
vehicle that sliced sharklike through the Syrian town of Ashrafieh Sahnaya on
Friday morning was impossible to miss.
Government forces had retaken control from the armed groups that turned the
town into a sectarian battlefield for two days this week, killing dozens and exposing
for all to see the new Syrian leaders’ shaky grip on security. Now, government
representatives had arrived to pledge peace to a skeptical town.
In an airy, echoing religious meeting hall, two officials in suits sat shoulder to
shoulder with white-bearded leaders of the Druse religious minority in traditional
red-topped white hats, talking of unity.
“We’re all in one ship,” said Jameel Mudawwar, the area’s top official. “If it sinks,
God forbid, we’ll all sink.”
The words were not new, but this time they came with action.
Syria’s main Druse militias, who control a strategic swath of southern Syria near
Israel, have resisted a push by the new Islamist government to be folded into the
national military, fearing that acceding would endanger their people.
After this week’s bloodshed, Druse leaders in Ashrafieh Sahnaya agreed to integrate
militia fighters into government forces. But some residents remain wary.
‘We’re All in One Ship’: But as the bloodshed mounted this week, local Druse leaders in Ashrafieh Sahnaya
went the other way. In exchange for government concessions, including promises
to investigate abuses committed during the clashes, they agreed to surrender their
weapons and integrate some fighters into the government’s forces.
Druse and government officials meeting in Ashrafieh Sahnaya on Friday.
“We should love each other, and we should all stand with each other,” the town’s 86-
year-old chief Druse religious leader, Sheikh Abu Rabih Haj Ali, said at Friday’s
meeting. “We don’t want to carry weapons. We don’t want to be against the state.”
It was what the government had hoped to hear for months now, after rebels from
Syria’s Sunni Muslim majority overthrew the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad in
December. But many Syrians from the country’s many religious and ethnic
minorities remain wary of their new leaders amid repeated spasms of violence
targeting minorities, including the Druse.
This week, a debunked audio clip purporting to be of a Druse cleric insulting the
Prophet Muhammad incited Sunni extremists to attack Druse, including in
Ashrafieh Sahnaya, south of Damascus, the capital. At least 101 people were killed,
including government forces, Druse fighters and civilians, according to the Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor.
In Ashrafieh Sahnaya, where different sects have long coexisted peacefully,
mortars and shells crashed into buildings. Drones struck from the sky, and
residents cowered indoors as local Druse militia fighters battled government forces
and armed Sunni extremists.
The rebel coalition that toppled Mr. al-Assad included some Islamist extremist
factions that remain outside central control, and that the Syrian authorities have
shown little capacity to rein in.
Israel, whose government is close to the Israeli Druse minority, then intervened in
the name of protecting Syrian Druse, launching airstrikes on Syrian government
targets.

There are more than one million Druse across the Middle East, mostly in Syria and
Lebanon, and some in Jordan and Israel. They practice a secretive offshoot of
Islam.
By Friday, the bloodshed still seemed more raw wound than memory for many.
One man at Friday’s meeting demanded government reassurances about security
and safety. Dispensing with the conciliatory tone of the others present, he accused
pro-government forces of slaughtering civilians.
The officials at the meeting pleaded for patience.
“We are promising you a better life,” said Mr. Mudawwar, the government official.
“What happens to you will happen to us. It’s the government’s duty to protect
everyone.”
Some listeners bought it.
Saleh Makiki, Mr. Haj Ali’s nephew, said he had lost five relatives this week,
including his father, a son and an uncle. Yet he said he was willing to move forward.
“We should love each other, and we should all stand with each other,” said Sheikh Abu
Rabih Haj Ali, an 86-year-old Druse religious leader in Syria.
“Mistakes happened, but we have assurances now,” he said. The government later
released 32 local men detained during the clashes, satisfying a key Druse demand.
Outside the meeting hall, however, opinions were divided.
Across the street, Bahira Haj Ali, 42, leaned out her window to watch the sheikh, a
relative, departing.
“It’s good we had the men to resist,” she said of the local Druse militias. “You can’t
imagine the sounds we heard — shells, drones.” It was hard to trust government
forces, she said, though, she added, she might feel different if men from Ashrafieh
Sahnaya joined.
As for Druse militias’ weapons, Ms. Haj Ali said: “This is our security. It shouldn’t
be given up.”
In town, there was disagreement over how the violence had begun.
Pro-government protests followed Israeli attacks on Syria on Friday.
Some Sunnis said that Druse militants had attacked government checkpoints after
extremists attacked a nearby town, while some Druse said that Sunni extremists
had struck first.
Around the town square, broken glass and bullet casings littered the ground.
Dozens of young men marched into the square after Friday prayers ended at a
nearby mosque, waving the flag of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Sunni former rebel
group that took power in December.
“One, one, one,” they chanted. “The Syrian people are one.”
But more often, it was their sect, not their country, that they emphasized.
“These are the Sunni,” they chanted. “The Prophet Muhammad is our eternal
leader.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/world/middleeast/syria-druse-sectarian-violence.html
Lizzie Dearden,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,U.K. Crossbow Attack Suspect Voiced Racist and Misogynist Views,"A man accused of wounding two women with a crossbow in the British city of
Leeds on Saturday has died of a self-inflicted injury, the police said on Tuesday.
The suspect, Owen Lawrence, 38, died in the hospital where he was taken after his
arrest at the scene of the attack, the counterterrorism police said in a statement.
The two women, ages 19 and 31, were seriously injured, the authorities said. One
was released from the hospital a day after the attack, but the other remained
hospitalized on Tuesday after undergoing surgery for life-threatening wounds, they
said.
The police said they were still investigating the motivation for the rampage, during
which witnesses saw the suspect walking along a three-mile stretch of pubs and
bars, known locally as the “Otley Run,” armed with a crossbow and several air
rifles.
The attack appeared to be the latest in a series of violent incidents in Britain in
recent years by individuals appearing to harbor a complex mix of motivations.
Some showed an interest in extremist content online, though they did not adhere to
a single ideology.
Last summer, three young girls were brutally murdered in a stabbing attack by a
violence-obsessed teenager in Southport. A prosecutor said in court that the
suspect had no political or religious ideology and that his “only purpose was to kill.”
The young man had viewed a large quantity of videos and material relating to
mass murder, violence and genocide, the authorities say.
Experts in  radicalization have warned of a rise in indiscriminate acts of violence of
a sort once mostly associated with ideologically driven terrorists.
A social media account associated with the suspect in the Leeds attack on the
weekend indicated an interest in mass shootings and in white supremacy, and
voiced misogynistic views.
The authorities have not yet decided whether to formally declare the incident a
terrorist attack. Under British law, that would require a finding that the violence
have been waged “for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or
ideological cause.”
Investigators are reviewing two Facebook accounts that the police believe
belonged to the suspect. One of the accounts was viewed by The New York Times
before it was taken down.
The most recent post, published shortly before the attack began at 2:45 p.m. on
Saturday, was titled “attack information” and contained photos of weapons that
matched images of items discarded on the ground following the assault.  It said the
targets would be “students, night club goers, pub crawlers, Otley Run participants,
society, humanity, humanitarian race, neurotypicals and police, if I need to.”
Under the heading “attack type,” the post said it was a “spree killing, mass murder,
terrorism, revenge, misogynistic rage, homicide/suicide.”
The Facebook user said he was a political “reactionary” who had “explored far
right ideas” and had read a notorious manifesto shared by the white supremacist
who carried out mass shootings at two New Zealand mosques in 2019. A separate
post referred to “the great replacement,”  a far-right conspiracy theory that white
people are being replaced by nonwhites in Western countries.
Another recurring theme on the account was a hatred of women, feminists and the
political left. A Feb. 15 post accused women of causing society to “degenerate” by
choosing the wrong partners. A week later, another post claimed that dating apps
like Tinder were “designed for women only.”
The Facebook account had been made public before the attack and the profile
picture showed a man believed to be the suspect holding a baseball bat and
wearing a T-shirt similar to one worn by one of the perpetrators of the 1999
Columbine High School massacre.
Mass shootings in America also drew attention on the account.
In 2024 the user shared a video relating to a 2017 gunman at a supermarket in
Pennsylvania, with the caption: “R.I.P. brother, identified with you a lot.”
Other attacks discussed on the Facebook page included one targeting Jews and
Muslims in Germany in 2019 and the 2011 Norway massacre by the white
supremacist Anders Breivik.
Several posts alluded to the Crusades, using the Latin phrase “Deus vult” — “God
wills it” — which was used by Christian armies and has since been adopted by far-
right groups. In November 2023, the man posted a photo of himself performing
what appears to be a Nazi salute.
But on Feb. 20 this year, the same account wrote that he did not identify with far-
right ideologies and had only “flirted with their ideas a bit.”
Several other posts  account made reference to health and well-being, saying he
was a recovering drug addict who attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/europe/uk-crossbow-attack-

Ian Austen,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,"Pierre Poilievre Raised Canada’s Conservative Party, Only to Be Tossed From His Seat","When protesting truckers rolled toward downtown Ottawa and proceeded to
occupy the Canadian capital for four weeks, they got a welcome from a man waving
to them from a highway overpass, his hands covered in knitted red mittens with
white maple leaves on the palms.
The man was Pierre Poilievre, who would become the leader of the Conservative
Party and who until just recently was widely referred to as Canada’s next prime
minister. Soon he will have a new title: ex-Member of Parliament.
In a stunning upset, voters in Mr. Poilievre’s district (or riding, as it is known in
Canada) turned him out of office on Monday. His embrace of the so-called Freedom
Convoy of 2022, appears to have played a significant role in the defeat.
Voters in this part of Canada have memories of that time — and not fond ones.
Canada’s Conservative Leader Is Tossed From
His Own Seat

With Ottawa paralyzed, local businesses forced to shut down and residents
struggling to sleep amid the round-the-clock air horn blasting, Mr. Poilievre
brought coffee and doughnuts to the truckers, who were protesting pandemic
restrictions and the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
On Tuesday, his support for the convoy, some leaders of which recently received
criminal convictions, was a recurring complaint among voters in his district,
Carleton.
“Populist politics is not for me,” declared one voter, Rick Pauloski, who said he had
supported Conservatives in the past.
The trucker protest was not the only explanation Canadians offered for the
candidate’s defeat.
Some said they did not trust Mr. Poilievre to deal effectively with President
Trump’s trade war with Canada and his vows to annex it as the 51st state, given his
echoing of the American president’s language. Mr. Poilievre, too, has condemned
“radical woke ideology” and also promised to shrink government, cut foreign aid
and in effect eliminate public broadcasting.
Others said they had grown tired of Mr. Poilievre’s style of attack politics, which he
took to a level not previously seen in Canada. “Canada is broken,” he would tell
voters — at least until Mr. Trump’s threats set off a wave of Canadian patriotism.
Some voters also said that as he rose to power, Mr. Poilievre neglected his local
constituency.
Mr. Pauloski said he was put off by Mr. Poilievre’s embrace of vaccine opposition,
which set off the truckers protest. “The fact that he has an anti-vaccine campaign
really bothered me, because I’m a research scientist,” he said.
Even some who in the end voted for Mr. Poilievre said they had moments of doubt.
Ever since his first run for the Canadian Parliament in 2004, Megan Johnson, a
lifelong Conservative, voted for him. But during the truckers’ siege of the capital, it
began to feel like too much.
“After he went all in for the trucker convoy, I said: I’m never voting for him again,”
Ms. Johnson recalled while out on a small tractor to do yard work on her seven-
acre property. “It really ticked me off.”
Ultimately Ms. Johnson couldn’t bring herself to vote for the Liberal Party and
planted a sign for Mr. Poilievre outside her home.
Signage on the ground at the constituency office of Mr. Poilievre, after he lost the

Voters in Canada do not cast ballots for the prime minister directly, only for local
members of Parliament. And while the Liberals performed the best in this week’s
elections, the Conservatives, notwithstanding Mr. Poilievre’s defeat, received their
highest share of the popular vote since 1988, gaining seats in the House of
Commons.
Mr. Poilievre’s loss came at the hands of a retired businessman and political novice
running on the Liberal Party line named Bruce Fanjoy.
Mr. Fanjoy started campaigning in 2023, an unusually long lead time for anyone
running for Canada’s Parliament. That year and the next the Liberals began a
dramatic plummet in polls that eventually left them nearly 30 percent points
behind Mr. Poilievre’s Conservatives. Voters blamed Mr. Trudeau, the Liberal who
stepped down as prime minister early this year, for inflation, interest rate increases
and upwardly spiraling house prices.
“There were times in the past two years when I was canvassing and it felt like I
had the wind in my face,” Mr. Fanjoy said. But after Mr. Trudeau stepped down and
was replaced by Mark Carney, the former central banker of Canada and England, it
got a lot easier.
In his district, there was little obvious sympathy on Tuesday for Mr. Poilievre.
In a shopping center parking lot in Manotick, one of the larger villages in the
constituency, Marilyn Schacht noted that around town Mr. Poilievre “seemed to be
well liked — until he wasn’t.”
She voted for him on Monday as did her husband, Ryan. Both said they thought
that Mr. Poilievre’s style was what Canada needed during its current economic and
political crisis.
“People were comparing him to Trump all the time, and the man you want to fight
Trump should be a Trump-like guy,” Mr. Schacht said. “You want Churchill to fight
against Hitler, you don’t want Chamberlain. I think we’ve got Chamberlain now.”
By Tuesday morning, Mr. Poilievre’s campaign office, on the top floor of a building
with signs for a church and a martial arts school in downtown Manotick, had
largely been emptied. A volunteer said that no one was available to comment
before closing the door.

During his concession speech early Tuesday morning, Mr. Poilievre vowed to stay
on as Conservative leader. The party’s caucus removed its two previous leaders
following election losses. It is not clear if that will be the case for a third time.
There has been widespread speculation that a Conservative member in a safe seat
in the party’s stronghold of Alberta will step down to allow Mr. Poilievre to return
to the House of Commons through a special election.
Outside a restored mill in Manotick, Mr. Fanjoy acknowledged that the
constituency has not suddenly joined the rest of Ottawa as Liberal territory.
“I discovered that while there’s a strong conservative tradition in Carleton, it
wasn’t a Pierre Poilievre tradition,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/world/canada/canada-poilievre-election-conservatives.html
Lizzie Dearden,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,Man Who Tried to Enter Israeli Embassy in London Charged With Terror Offense,"A man has been charged with a terrorism offense in London after he attempted to
enter the Israeli Embassy armed with two knives, the police said on Wednesday.
The Metropolitan Police, which is responsible for law enforcement in London, said
Abdullah Sabah Albadri, 33, was arrested after being seen “attempting to gain
unauthorized access” to the grounds of the embassy shortly before 6 p.m. on
Monday.
“Officers prevented the man from entering and arrested him on suspicion of a
public order offense, trespassing on a designated site and possession of an
offensive weapon,” the police force said in a statement.

“He was taken to a London police station and after further enquiries were carried
out he was further arrested on suspicion of an offense contrary to Section 5 of the
Terrorism Act 2006.”
The charge is used against people accused of preparing or attempting terror
attacks.
Mr. Albadri, of no fixed address, has also been charged with two counts of
possession of a bladed article, the statement added.
Mr. Albadri appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday afternoon
but spoke only to confirm his identity and did not enter a plea.
Prosecutor Kristel Pous said that police officers tackled Mr. Albadri after seeing
him attempt to climb over a wall outside the embassy. After his arrest, she said, a
“martyrdom note” was found in his pocket, though she did not give further details.
Ms. Pous said Mr. Albadri told officers at the scene that he wanted to “send a
message to the Israeli government to stop the war” in Gaza.
Judge Tan Ikram said Mr. Albadri would be held in custody ahead of another
hearing on May 7.
Dominic Murphy, the head of the Metropolitan Police’s Counter Terrorism
Command, said that the police were not seeking anyone else in connection with the
incident and that they did not believe there was “any wider threat to the public.”
The Israeli Embassy, in the Kensington neighborhood, has tight security measures.
In a statement, the Embassy thanked the police for preventing what it described as
an “attempted terror attack.”
“We are relieved to report that this attack was prevented by the British security
forces and that no injuries occurred and all embassy staff and visitors are safe,” the
statement added.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia has won a second term, completing
a stunning turnaround for his governing center-left Labor Party that trailed in the
polls for months as a festering cost-of-living crisis weighed on voters.
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the country’s public broadcaster, called
the election for Mr. Albanese just a half-hour after the last polls closed on Saturday.
It was a resounding defeat of the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton. He
began the campaign riding dissatisfaction with the status quo, but was hamstrung
by a string of missteps and an association with some of President Trump’s
messaging and policies.

Term in Remarkable Comeback

Mr. Dutton, the leader of the Liberal Party, also lost his parliamentary seat in the
conservative stronghold of Queensland, which he had held since 2001. His loss
echoed the ouster of Canada’s conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, whose defeat
was seen as a rejection of his embrace of Mr. Trump.
Australia was the third major U.S. ally, after Germany and Canada, to hold
elections since Mr. Trump’s second term began in January. The Trump
administration’s efforts to influence the vote in Germany did not appear to bear
fruit. In Canada, Mark Carney won another term on an anti-Trump platform. While
Mr. Trump did not figure as prominently in Australia’s election, the global turmoil
unleashed by his administration has weighed on voters there.
Neither camp mentioned Mr. Trump by name on Saturday night but the nods to his
influence were clear. In his victory speech, an emotional Mr. Albanese said
Australians had chosen “to face global challenges the Australian way.”
“We do not need to beg, or borrow, or copy from anywhere else,” he said. “We do
not seek our inspiration overseas.”

For many younger voters, Mr. Albanese’s re-election was not an approval of his
first term but a reluctant choice between two parties without bold ideas to fix the
country’s problems, said Intifar Chowdhury, a lecturer in government at Flinders
University in Adelaide.
In giving Mr. Albanese a second term, she said, “you are choosing the known evil
over the unknown evil.”
With more than half the votes counted, the ABC projected that the Labor Party
would widen its parliamentary majority in the 150-seat House of Representatives
to at least 86 seats, from 78.
Voters casting their ballots Saturday said they were struggling to make ends meet.
“Everything costs so much,” said Judy Pula, a registered nurse and mother of two
who was voting in the Sydney suburb of Liverpool during a break in her shift. Ms.
Pula, 29, said she had voted for Labor in the past but this time opted for the
Australian Greens. “I feel like a new leader would be beneficial for us.”
Cognizant of citizens’ pocketbook concerns, Mr. Dutton went to more than a dozen
gas stations on the campaign trail, pitching his party’s proposal to cut a tax to
reduce the price at the pump. Mr. Albanese repeatedly flashed his card for
Medicare, Australia’s universal health care system, highlighting a promise to lower
out-of-pocket costs.

Yet both parties mostly put forth largely incremental, short-term relief proposals
rather than ambitious changes to address the fundamental roots of the current
doldrums. The candidates also largely steered clear of what many agree is the
most challenging global environment for Australia in a generation: its heavy
reliance on the United States for defense and its economic dependence on trade
with China, which has become less tenable as rivalry between the two superpowers
flares up.
“Mate, I’m not confident in either of them,” said Deb Young, 54, who had gone to
the polls near Brisbane in Mr. Dutton’s home state of Queensland with her 11-year-
old granddaughter. “They just keep addressing the same thing — cost of living.
Move on. Why don’t they address the other issues out there?”
Ms. Young, a mental health nurse, still cast her vote for Mr. Dutton’s center-right
Liberal Party, because she wanted Labor out of power.
Saturday’s victory for Mr. Albanese was a hard-fought recovery from the political
low point of his first term: the failure of a 2023 referendum to enshrine the rights of
representation for Aboriginal Australians in Parliament. It had been a major
campaign pledge of his when he was elected the previous year.
Mr. Dutton, a former police officer, opposed the measure and continued to take a
stance against other symbolic recognitions of Indigenous people, saying they were
“overdone.”

Early in the campaign, Mr. Dutton had adopted some buzzwords or policies that
echoed Mr. Trump, including denouncing what he characterized as “wokeness” and
diversity initiatives. That strategy seemed aimed at riding the worldwide
rightward, anti-incumbent currents that dominated last year. But as the first
months of the Trump presidency have played out, the association began to hurt Mr.
Dutton.
Grahame Don, 56, voted for the Liberal Party for decades but started backing
Labor in the last election. Mr. Trump’s tone of talking about issues was bleeding
into Australian politics, he said on Saturday.
“This country has only gained from things like migration and international
students that they have tried to make divisive,” he said.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/asia/australia-prime-minister-

Neil MacFarquhar,NYT,1,World,5/3/2025,Oil Prices Are Falling. Here’s Where That Could Spell Trouble.,"Oil producing countries are bracing for a bumpy ride this year, with a precipitous
drop in prices to the lowest levels in four years seen as the initial, alarming sign of
looming turmoil.
A price drop benefits any country seeking to cut its fuel bill. But in oil producing
nations, lower prices can feed economic troubles, and sometimes political unrest,
as governments slash spending.
Analysts who had already been predicting lower oil prices because of softening
demand amid increased global production said the possibility of a tariff trade war
and the overall climate of uncertainty could well deepen producers’ woes.
“The steep price dive and overall volatility is sending a very strong signal that the
global economy is going to be rattled this year and that will translate into a lower
demand for oil,” said Gregory Brew, a specialist on the geopolitics of oil and gas
with the Eurasia Group, a New York-based risk analysis organization.

Wealthy producers may be able to cushion the blow
Earlier this year, the price for benchmark crude held steady around $73 a barrel,
high enough to sustain the budgets of most producing nations. But some countries,
like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, base ambitious development plans
on a price of at least $90 a barrel, analysts say.

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have earmarked hundreds of billions of
dollars for giant projects to try to diversify their economies away from oil. Although
Saudi Arabia pays for its Vision 2030 development program outside its annual
budget, the huge, futuristic city project, Neom, depends on oil revenues.
To maintain those plans amid lower prices, these richer Gulf nations either have to
draw money from their gargantuan reserve funds or borrow, analysts said. Saudi
Arabia, the U.A.E. and Kuwait all have easy access to international credit, and can
sustain that for years with citizens unlikely to feel the effects, analysts said.
A different story for Iran and Iraq
In Iran, international sanctions have whittled its oil customers down. There’s
China, but its demand for oil has slackened markedly amid an economic slowdown.
And there are small independent refineries vulnerable to secondary sanctions,
which the United States has imposed against two of them in recent months. To
attract buyers, Iran will quite likely have to offer steep discounts, analysts said.
Iran is negotiating with Washington over the future of its nuclear program; any
agreement could bring sanctions relief. But that is unlikely this year.
Iran also faces increasing pressure to cut spending by lowering its domestic energy
subsidies. When it did that in 2019, antigovernment riots erupted and were put
down with force. “Keeping energy prices very low is extremely important because
they know that if they don’t, then they are at a relatively high risk of uprisings,
riots and demonstrations,” said Homayoun Falakshahi, an analyst at the research
firm Kpler.
Next door, Iraq depends on oil for an estimated 80 percent of government revenue,
so a drop in price would force it to take measures like not paying public sector
salaries for chunks of time, a step sure to create domestic discontent. Since the
country is not under sanctions, it too can borrow internationally to cover its bills,
although that is costly.

Vulnerability in Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela
Libya’s two governments each hold a different half of the country. One runs the
bank that takes in oil payments from abroad and the other controls the oil fields.
Any price drop would likely ratchet up tensions between the two as they jockey
over the revenue, analysts said.
Nigeria’s economy remains terribly vulnerable to a drop in oil revenue, on which it
depends to help subsidize energy prices. A new, almost completed private refinery
could mitigate the kind of fuel supply problems that can spark political unrest.
Aside from Iran, the other global producer most exposed to price volatility is
Venezuela, whose economy collapsed during the drop in prices in 2014-15. Public
sector businesses and a bloated government payroll were so dependent on high oil
prices that when they collapsed, analysts said, the ensuing economic problems
sparked widespread protests that the government put down violently.
Help from Russia and Iran has helped leaven the potential fallout this time around,
since increased production and refinery capacity mean Venezuela is unlikely to
face the kind of fuel shortages that caused widespread blackouts and fueled public
anger.

And then, there’s Russia
In Russia, about one third of the federal budget, predicated on about $70 a barrel
for oil, comes from energy revenues. With sanctions, Russia discounts its oil by
about $10 a barrel; a $60 price matches the price cap imposed in 2022 after it
invaded Ukraine.
Robust oil and gas sales, especially to China and India, have helped insulate
ordinary Russians from much economic fallout from the war. The Kremlin has
already eaten into its reserve funds, however, and a further price drop would make
paying for the war, and everything else, challenging.
Moscow probably still has enough cash reserves to muddle through, but in the
short term, there could be pain, analysts said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/world/europe/oil-prices-tariffs.html
Zia ur-Rehman,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,Families Are Split as Pakistan Deports Thousands of Afghan Refugees,"Every night in Karachi, a bustling port city in Pakistan, Fatima Bibi goes to bed in
fear. The sound of police sirens from the streets outside makes her anxious. She
wonders whether a knock at the door might tear her family apart.
Her husband, Sher Zada, is an Afghan refugee. His family fled conflict in
Afghanistan when he was just a boy, in 1992, and Pakistan is the only home he
knows. Ms. Bibi’s family long hoped that despite Mr. Zada’s undocumented status,
his close ties to the country and marriage to a Pakistani national would eventually
help him secure permanent residency, if not citizenship.
But to the Pakistani government, it is officially past time for Mr. Zada to leave.

On March 31, a government-imposed deadline expired for many Afghans in
Pakistan to find another country of refuge. Those without legal status who remain
in Pakistan, like Mr. Zada, now face repatriation. Less than three weeks after the
deadline’s expiration, the Pakistani minister of state for interior, Talal Chaudhry,
announced at a news conference that more than 80,000 Afghans had already been
expelled.
The deportations could subject the refugees to perilous conditions under the heavy
hand of Taliban rule in Afghanistan. And, if they are married to Pakistanis, it could
mean leaving their families behind.
“What will happen to my children and me if Zada is taken away?” Ms. Bibi said.

The campaign to deport Afghans coincides with a resurgent conflict with India,
Pakistan’s eastern neighbor and archrival. India has ordered almost all Pakistani
citizens to leave the country, part of its response to a terrorist attack in Kashmir
that it has linked to Pakistan. The Pakistani government, which denies any
involvement in the attack and has asked for an international investigation into it,
responded by canceling most Indian citizens’ visas.
Pakistan’s crackdown on Afghans follows years of tightening restrictions on Afghan
residency. Recent U.N. reports indicate that over 910,000 Afghans have been
deported from the country since September 2023.
The deportations have been motivated largely by officials’ frustration with the
Taliban government, which they accuse of harboring Pakistani militants
responsible for deadly attacks inside Pakistan. The Taliban deny those allegations,
but tensions continue to rise.
Pakistan’s military said on Sunday that it had killed 54 militants trying to infiltrate
the country from Afghanistan over the previous two nights. Pakistan said the
militants had been “khawarij” — a term it often uses for the Pakistani Taliban.
The Pakistani government has also been emboldened by a tide of anti-immigrant
sentiment around the world. It has drawn parallels to recent deportation efforts in
the United States and various European countries to justify its own campaign.
Among the Afghans facing deportation in Pakistan are those who arrived after the
Taliban seized power in August 2021 and now await resettlement in Western
countries, including the United States. Pakistan extended the deadline for their
relocation to another country to Wednesday, after which they will again face
deportation.
Their fate became increasingly uncertain in January when President Trump issued
an executive order suspending all refugee admissions to the United States. The
decision left thousands of Afghans stranded in Pakistan with no clear recourse.

In October 2023, during an earlier wide-ranging effort to expel undocumented
Afghans, Mr. Zada was detained. He narrowly avoided deportation only after Ms.
Bibi’s father paid a last-minute bribe to secure his release.
This year’s renewed deportation campaign forced Mr. Zada and his family to leave
their home. Ms. Bibi’s father offered them shelter, putting himself at risk. At the
news conference this month, Mr. Chaudhry warned of strict repercussions for
anyone who helped Afghans stay in the country illegally.
Rights groups say that the plight of refugees like Mr. Zada — Afghans married to
Pakistani citizens — is one of the most overlooked aspects of Pakistan’s deportation
drive.
While no official data on the subject is available, rights groups like the Joint Action
Committee for Refugees, a Pakistani civil society network, estimate that thousands
of Afghan-Pakistani marriages have taken place. They are especially common in
parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, Pakistani provinces that share a
porous border with Afghanistan.
Such weddings are often conducted through tribal customs or informal community
ceremonies. Though socially recognized, the unions frequently lack formal
documentation, such as marriage certificates, making it hard for the Afghan spouse
to obtain legal residency or citizenship.
Even in big cities like Karachi, Afghans with Pakistani spouses often face obstacles
to formally registering their marriages or the births of their children.
According to Pakistan’s National Database and Registration Authority, or NADRA,
foreign spouses of Pakistani citizens are eligible for a Pakistan origin card, which
would grant them visa-free entry and the right to stay indefinitely and own
property. But many Afghan applicants are denied the card.

cannot afford the fees. Abdul Basit/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images
Legal experts have told Mr. Zada that his marriage to Ms. Bibi gives him a chance,
if a slim one, of staying in Pakistan legally. But the lengthy process and the high
fees are prohibitive. Mr. Zada earns just $3 a day, he said.
Some Pakistanis married to Afghans have turned to the judiciary for relief from the
bureaucratic obstacles. In July, a court in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ruled in favor of 65
petitioners, affirming that their Afghan spouses were eligible for dual nationality.
But such cases are uncommon.
Umer Ijaz Gilani, an expert on refugee rights based in Pakistan’s capital,
Islamabad, said the authorities had deliberately fostered the perception that
refugees had few options for obtaining legal residency or citizenship, despite
constitutional guarantees and numerous rulings from higher courts.
“The core problem lies in the government’s erratic and inadequate implementation
of existing safeguards, not in the laws themselves,” Mr. Gilani said.
Refugee-rights activists also say that NADRA withholds origin cards from
applicants who qualify, often citing the need for clearance from Pakistan’s
intelligence agencies. NADRA officials declined to comment on those claims.
Regardless of family ties, all undocumented Afghans must leave the country, Pakistani officials said.

The Pakistani authorities remain firmly committed to the deportation campaign.
Officials say that all undocumented Afghans must leave the country and re-enter
on valid visas, regardless of marital or familial connections. But current
immigration restrictions can make it almost impossible for them to secure visas
after they leave.
Mukaram Shah, an undocumented Afghan migrant married to a Pakistani woman,
had been living on the outskirts of Quetta, a city about 70 miles from the Afghan
border. In December 2023, he was arrested by the police while working as a porter
at a local vegetable market.
Without any legal proceedings, his family said, Mr. Shah was taken directly to the
Chaman border crossing and deported to Afghanistan.
“We could not even say a proper goodbye,” said his wife, Palwasha, who, like many
women from rural Pakistan, goes by a single name.
Her family, citing security and economic concerns, refused to let her follow her
husband, believing he would return on a long-term visa. But under the current
crackdown on Afghan refugees, that hope is fading.
“Every night, my children ask when their father will come home,” Palwasha said,
her voice breaking. “I don’t have an answer. All I can do is pray.”

Max Bearak,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,"Days After Trump Commits to Seabed Mining, Two Sides Face Off","Less than a week after President Trump signed an executive order to accelerate
seabed mining, the U.S. government received its first permit application from the
Metals Company, one of the most ardent proponents of the as yet unproven
practice.
On Tuesday, the company’s chief executive, Gerard Barron, was also on hand in
Washington for a contentious hearing in front of the House Natural Resources
Committee. He likened Mr. Trump’s move to a “starting gun” in the race to extract
minerals like cobalt and nickel from potato-size nodules lying in the frigid, pitch-
black, two-and-a-half-mile-deep sands of the Pacific Ocean floor.
Republican and Democratic committee members clashed over how much weight
should be given to environmental concerns about the practice. The Trump
administration has said it will consider issuing permits for mining in territorial U.S.
waters and also in international waters.
Other countries have condemned the United States for essentially circumventing
international law by saying it would permit seabed mining in waters that nearly
every other country considers to be governed by the International Seabed
Authority, an independent organization.
No commercial-scale seabed mining has ever taken place.
Representative Jared Huffman of California, who is also the committee’s ranking
Democrat, said the Metals Company and Mr. Trump were moving seabed mining
forward in a “reckless cowboy manner.” He and other Democrats questioned the
business case for mining cobalt and nickel given that electric-vehicle
manufacturers, once major buyers of the metals, were moving toward batteries
that didn’t use them.
“The industry’s financial models are based on wildly optimistic assumptions and
fail to reflect the volatility and reality of global mineral markets,” said
Representative Maxine E. Dexter, Democrat of Oregon.
The Metals Company sought to assure the committee that any damage to the
seafloor would be far outweighed by potential job creation and access to minerals
whose supply chains are currently dominated by China. The company says it has
conducted a decade of expensive environmental studies that support its
conclusions.
Mr. Trump’s order came after years of delays at the International Seabed Authority
in setting up a regulatory framework for seabed mining. The authority, created
decades ago under the auspices of the United Nations, is likely to miss another
deadline this year to codify those rules.
“It took 14 years just to begin drafting a mining code,” Mr. Barron told the
committee, calling it “a deliberate strategy” to slow seabed mining.
He also said a polymetallic nodule extracted by his company was presented to Mr.
Trump recently, and he claimed it now sat on the president’s desk in the Oval
Office.
The U.S. Geological Survey has estimated that nodules in a single swath of the
Eastern Pacific, known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, contain more nickel, cobalt
and manganese than all terrestrial reserves combined. That area, where the
Metals Company is proposing to mine, is in the open ocean between Mexico and
Hawaii and covers an area about half the size of the continental United States.
The committee’s chairman, Representative Paul Gosar, Republican of Arizona, said
seabed mining was needed to get the United States out from under the “supply
chain yoke” of China, which currently processes a majority of the world’s cobalt,
much of its nickel and many other critical minerals, which include so-called rare
earths.
China recently imposed export restrictions on some rare-earth elements, leading to
fears that American companies using them to make an array of advanced
electronics would face shortages.
The House committee also heard from Thomas Peacock, a professor of mechanical
engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has taken part in
studies of seabed mining’s effects on the seafloor, some of which were funded in
part by the Metals Company.
Dr. Peacock said that while there were potentially hundreds of unknown species in
the Clarion-Clipperton Zone and that specific areas deserved to be cordoned off
from mining, “research indicates that some of the proposed impacts of nodule
mining may not be as severe as speculated.”
In particular, he downplayed the risks that mining could cause plumes of sand and
debris that could affect life on the seafloor as well as closer to the surface of the
open ocean, where fish like tuna live and feed. The debris would be “roughly the
equivalent of a grain of sand in a fishbowl,” Dr. Peacock said.
Sitting next to Mr. Barron was the chief executive of another prospective deep-sea
miner, Impossible Metals. Unlike the Metals Company, which has extraction
technology that resembles a vacuum attached to an autonomous vehicle that would
trundle across the seafloor, sending up nodules to a ship through a pipe, Impossible
Metals says it has a machine that will pick up nodules individually and without
actually landing on the seafloor.
“Our underwater robots hover to collect the mineral-rich nodules from the seabed
through an A.I.-driven selective harvesting,” Oliver Gunasekara, the chief
executive of Impossible Metals, said. “We pick up nodules individually avoiding all
visible life, leaving 60 percent untouched.”
The company has reapplied for an exploration permit off American Samoa in U.S.
territorial waters. Mr. Gunasekara said that while an earlier application had been
denied under the Biden administration, both American Samoa and Washington
were under new leadership and he was confident of its approval.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/climate/seabed-mining-trump-congress.html
Frances Robles,NYT,1,World,4/14/2025,A Small City That Lost Big in the Dominican Nightclub Tragedy,"Half the board of directors of a seniors club perished, as did the president of the
Lion’s Club, a high school teacher and the owner of a trucking company. Tony
Blanco, a retired major league baseball player who died in the disaster, was a
native son.
So was Rubby Pérez, the merengue singer whose concert drew more than 400
people — many from his hometown.
In the wake of a nightclub roof collapse that killed hundreds of people, the
Dominican Republic is brimming in grief. That heartbreak is perhaps most
palpable in Haina, an industrial city outside the capital that lost more than two
dozen people in the tragedy, including community leaders and cultural heroes.
A gritty municipality best known for its bustling seaport and a legacy of lead
pollution that once gave it the unwelcome moniker “the Dominican Chernobyl” now
has another undesirable distinction. When the roof of the Jet Set disco came
crashing down last Tuesday morning, killing 226 people, it dealt a heavy blow to the
small city.
Twenty-five people from there were among those who died.
“God has a way of communicating with us, and sometimes it is difficult to
understand,” the former Red Sox player David Ortiz, better known as Big Papi, said
Sunday. Mr. Ortiz used to live in Haina, and traveled there to help bury its dead.

Joined by the president, Luis Abinader, dozens of residents gathered in a
sweltering gym to say goodbye. They clutched white roses and tried through tears
to understand how a single town could lose so many people. Some wondered aloud
how they would ever manage to laugh and sing again.
A photo slide show of the victims flashed on two large screens while an evangelical
pastor and a Catholic priest offered consoling words.
The singer Joselito Trinidad performed stirring ballad renditions of “Looking For
Your Kisses” and “I Will Return,” two of Mr. Pérez’s merengue songs. He sang in
the high pitch that Mr. Pérez, known as the “highest voice in merengue,” was
famous for.
“We are a people who have known how to unite through thick and thin, and this is
no exception,” he said before singing. “As a native Hainero, I raise my voice so that
we remember that voice that took wings and went to a better place.”
In the gym, many bleacher seats remained empty: People around town were busy
attending funerals.

“Oh, my beautiful friend, there’s no one like her anymore!” cried Kirsis Bautista,
whose friend, Juana Vásquez, died in the disaster. “Mr. President, justice! Let me
see Luis Abinader and say: ‘justice!’”
Mr. Pérez, 69, was a well-known merengue artist and a member of the Golden
Haineros, a private social club for people over 55 to gather and attend educational
workshops. The club’s 143 members were also his fans, so 25 of them made the half-
hour trip to Santo Domingo to watch him perform at Jet Set.
Only 12 made it out.
The organization’s vice president died, as did the treasurer and event planner.
“The first thing I said when I heard about what happened was that I was going to
quit,” said Hectór Rincón, the club’s president. “People told me, ‘no, we have to find
the strength to keep this going in honor of those who died.’”
The seniors rent a space above a nightclub called the House of the Drunk, where
they play dominoes and throw birthday parties, adhering to strict rules: no talk of
politics, religion or sports.
On Sunday morning before the service, the club was still decorated in balloons and
birthday banners from the last celebration, but a large black ribbon on the front
door gave away that something terrible had happened. The mood was grim among
a handful of members, gathered before yet another funeral.

Now instead of organizing jewelry-making workshops, Mr. Rincón is looking for
psychologists to help survivors. “This is like a war,” he said. “When you come back
from war, you are not the same.”
Mr. Rincón grew up with Mr. Pérez, and they sang in a choir together as teenagers.
“Haina was his everything,” Mr. Rincón said.
He tried to share more fond memories of his friend. Tears got in the way, so he
talked instead about the town’s industrial history.
Haina’s official name, which nobody uses, is Bajos de Haina, or the Haina
Lowlands. Home to about 158,000 people, it is about eight miles west of Santo
Domingo.
The country’s only oil refinery is here, and its port moves more than a third of the
country’s maritime cargo.

Mr. Rincón recalled its heyday, when a sugar mill and other factories churned out
engineers, mechanics and workers in other skilled trades. Those businesses are
gone now.
“This was a town of migrants — mostly miners and agricultural workers,” said
Jesús Ramírez, a member of the Lions Club, which lost three members. “And it
turned out some of the country’s best sports players and artists.”
The Lion’s Club will particularly miss its president, Luis Emilio Guillén, who was
also vice president of the seniors’ club. A former soccer player who owned a trophy
company, he was known for attending every cultural and sports event.
“We are going to continue the work he was doing in sports and culture,” said
Margarita Tejeda, who represents Haina in Congress and is a Lion’s Club member.
“This is a collective pain. Everyone is in a lot of pain.”

England ahead of local elections, hoping to convert a polling surge for Reform
U.K. into power.

Updated May 2, 2025
The pulsing beat of a dance track grew to a thunderous pitch and the crowd rose to
its feet. Beams of light flashed across the cavernous arena in Birmingham, central
England. Then, at last, Nigel Farage, the right-wing populist leader who claims he
can fix a “broken Britain,” arrived onstage, hitching a ride on a backhoe.
Mr. Farage, who leads the anti-immigration party Reform U.K., has long been one
of Britain’s most ardent supporters of President Trump. He has learned from the
president’s campaign tactics, too.
That means, among other things, that the political rally is back in Britain.
Why Nigel Farage is Bringing MAGA-Style
Rallies to Britain

The Times’s chief political analyst, makes sense of the latest political
data. Get it in your inbox.
In the weeks before municipal elections and a special election in England on May 1,
Mr. Farage has been touring the country, taking to the stage in Cornwall,
Darlington and Hull, smiling broadly, cracking jokes and railing against “illegal
immigrants,” whom he promises to deport.
Since returning to the leadership of Reform last year and then being elected as a
British lawmaker for the first time, Mr. Farage has led the insurgent party to an
extraordinary surge in the polls. It won 14 percent of the vote last July, but now
regularly polls at around 25 percent, overtaking the main opposition Conservatives
and, in some surveys, the governing Labour Party.

Thursday’s elections, while limited in number, are the first test of Reform’s ability
to convert that polling into power. Analysts expect the party to emerge with
hundreds of municipal seats and two regional mayors. It’s also favored to win a
closely fought special election for a parliamentary seat the same night.
Mr. Farage is a charismatic, fluent speaker who, like Mr. Trump, embraces an “us-
versus-them” rhetoric when it comes to undocumented immigrants and other
political parties. His rallies stand out in a country where the bulk of politics long
ago switched from public speechmaking to TV and now social media.
British politicians tend to address large crowds now only during election
campaigns or at their annual party conferences. Jeremy Corbyn, the hard-left
former leader of the Labour Party, was a notable exception in 2017 when he spoke
at the Glastonbury music festival and was serenaded enthusiastically by
concertgoers.
“Rallies have gone out of political fashion,” said Neil Kinnock, who led Labour from
1983 to 1992, and was one of the most accomplished orators of his era. He was
famed for his platform speeches, including his 1983 warning against voting
Conservative and his passionate denunciation of the hard left in 1985. He’s also
cited in Britain as an example of oratory’s dangers: An arena rally he held before
the 1992 election was seen by some critics as contributing to Labour’s defeat that
year, though polling evidence contradicts the theory.
Mr. Kinnock is no fan of Mr. Farage’s speeches. “When I’m being condescending —
sorry — I think of it as saloon bar chatter from behind a microphone,” he said. “But
with the right audience it’s certainly effective.”
Reform’s rallies stand out in Britain, where politics today usually focuses on social media, not on large

The Reform rally formula, Mr. Kinnock said, includes lots of noise, speakers to
warm up the crowd, then “a Farage crescendo,” where the leader “is projected as a
sort of Everyman Messiah.” The rallies are “not unlike Trump’s,” he noted, with
“repetitive themes, some rambling, with phrases that the audience likes;
references to immigration and its alleged consequences are unmissable.”
Mr. Trump’s MAGA events have sometimes drawn tens of thousands to big open-
air venues. They feature a thumping soundtrack (“Y.M.C.A.,” by the Village People,
is a standard), as well as provocative, crowd-pleasing moments, like when Mr.
Trump points out the TV cameras and journalists at the back of the arena and
labels them “fake news.”
Such theatrics played a critical role in Mr. Trump’s political rise, according to
Stephen K. Bannon, who was chief executive of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign.
“When he came down that escalator in New York and went to Iowa two days later,
we had nothing,” said Mr. Bannon, referring to June 2015, when Mr. Trump
announced his candidacy. “The rallies became everything. The Trump campaign
was essentially a series of rallies.”
After the Brexit vote in 2016, Mr. Bannon said the campaign recognized Mr.
Farage’s value as a warm-up act. In August that year, Mr. Farage appeared
alongside Mr. Trump at a MAGA rally in Jackson, Miss.

York Times
Brexit was Britain’s “Independence Day,” Mr. Farage declared, as Mr. Trump
beamed and clapped.
“We drilled Brexit into people’s heads,” Mr. Bannon said. “By the time we had Nigel
come over, he was a rock star among the MAGA faithful. You have to have someone
with charisma. He’s also a fun guy, like Trump.”
At the event in Birmingham, Reform had built a stage set intended to symbolize a
depleted nation, including a mound of trash bags (a clear reference to the city’s
garbage strike), a bus stop covered in graffiti and a shuttered pub.
Mr. Farage attacked the government’s net zero targets and pledged that a Reform
government would “get rid of the Human Rights Act” and deport undocumented
migrants. “Let me tell you, everyone who comes illegally will be deported, end of
story,” he said, to the loudest whoops and cheers of the night.
Birmingham was not — as had been promised — the largest political rally in
modern British history. The party said it sold around 10,000 tickets but there were
hundreds of empty seats. Yet by drawing thousands of people, some traveling
hundreds of miles, to a political event, Mr. Farage achieved something no other
British party has recently attempted.
He has already held rallies at critical moments of a long political career in which he
has led three parties and campaigned for Brexit. In 2016, just before the
referendum in which Britain voted to leave the European Union, Mr. Farage
addressed supporters in Gateshead in northeastern England, holding up a placard
reading: “We want our country back.”

Last year, his arrival at a rally in Clacton-on-Sea, which he now represents in
Parliament, was marked by pyrotechnics and an Eminem song booming out:
“Guess who’s back, back again?”
In the Birmingham arena, Caroline Woodman, 61, from Leigh on Sea, an Essex
town more than two hours’ drive from the venue, said she wanted lower
immigration, higher living standards and to “get rid of the wokeness.” Unable to
work while she awaits a foot operation, Ms. Woodman, a teacher, said she was
raised in a Labour-supporting family but has voted for Mr. Farage for more than
two decades.
“I know he’s an honest, dutiful, kind person who would put our country first and he
will look after the people,” she said.
Gary Jackson, 56, from east Yorkshire, is a retired police commander. He
previously voted Conservative but now expects Mr. Farage to be the next prime
minister. “I don’t know any other politician who answers as straight as he does,” he
said.
Robert Hayward, a Conservative member of the House of Lords and a polling
expert, said the rallies were galvanizing the supporters needed to build Reform
U.K. into a nationwide party that could challenge Labour in 2028 or 2029, when
Britain will next hold a general election.
“It establishes a sense of momentum by bringing all these people together,” said
Mr. Hayward. “No other party at the moment could do anything like that.”

Reporting from Singapore
Published May 2, 2025
Updated May 3, 2025, 10:38 a.m. ET
The last time Singapore held elections, it was in the throes of a global crisis. That’s
also true today.
Five years ago, the governing party portrayed itself as the steady hand to guide
the nation through the coronavirus pandemic. The pitch is the same this time, only
with a different catalyst: President Trump’s upending of the international trade
order.
And, like last time, there is no doubt that the People’s Action Party, which has been
in power since 1959, will retain office. But Saturday’s election will be a test of the
popularity of the P.A.P., which had a near record-low showing in 2020, even as it
garnered a clear majority. It was growing evidence of a desire for a competitive
democracy in the city-state.
Counting started on Saturday night after polling stations closed at 8 p.m. local time.
A final result is not expected until after midnight. The voting age in Singapore is 21,
and all citizens are required to vote. About 82 percent of 2.6 million eligible voters
had cast their ballots as of 5 p.m., according to the elections department.
Many political analysts agree that the opposition is gaining clout in Singapore, with
voters unhappy about the P.A.P.’s response to the rising cost of living. During the
campaign, rallies for the country’s main opposition party, the Workers’ Party, were
packed. Still, Pritam Singh, the party’s leader, took pains to assure the public that
his party was not contesting enough seats to form a government, merely that
Singapore needed a more balanced political system.
“When you have opposition in Parliament, your alternative voice is heard by the
government,” Mr. Singh said at his party’s first rally last week.

Steven Yeong, 54, echoed that sentiment. “Like many Singaporeans, I would like to
see more robust debates in Parliament, with more representation from diverse
voices,” said Mr. Yeong, who has been unemployed for six months.
Another issue that has been a worry, he added, is how “the government makes it
rather easy for educated foreigners to compete for jobs with us.”
The election is the first under Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who took office last
year after the two-decade tenure of Lee Hsien Loong, a son of Singapore’s founding
father. Mr. Wong has said that navigating the trade war and U.S.-China tensions
“will take people in government who have built up trust and close relationships
with their counterparts in both America and China.”
Mr. Wong has warned that the tariffs imposed by the United States will hurt
Singapore. Its economy is highly dependent on international trade, with a trade-to-
GDP ratio of more than 300 percent, nearly five times the global average. Situated
along the Straits of Malacca, one of the world’s major shipping lanes, Singapore’s
port ranks among the world’s busiest.
Mr. Wong reiterated the same argument that his party has made for decades: that
the P.A.P. has a track record of delivering stability and prosperity to this nation of
nearly six million, one of the world’s richest per capita.
The problem is, many average Singaporeans no longer feel prosperous. Singapore
now has more millionaires than London. While average wealth has more than
doubled in local currency terms, median wealth has fallen 1.8 percent from 2008 to
2023, according to the Swiss bank UBS.

“We can see the gap growing quite substantially,” said Kris Tan, 44, a personal
trainer. His wife is a hawker, and he describes their family as lower to middle class.
“I am worried about our children’s future in terms of housing, in terms of the cost
of living for them.”
Mr. Tan said he was also concerned about the growing elitism, which he says “is
getting more and more obvious with regards to the upper echelons of the
government compared to the people.” He referenced the million-dollar salaries that
the country’s ministers earn.
“My concern is that the government is bringing the country up,” he said, “but it’s
also leaving a lot of people behind.”
In the last election, the P.A.P. conceded a record 10 seats to the opposition. Since
then, the government has bolstered social spending, giving temporary financial
support to people who have been laid off and offering vouchers to help with daily
expenses. But it has continued to face discontent over the rising cost of living,
increases in the sales tax, and declining housing affordability, issues that the
opposition has seized on.
The opposition has widely criticized the P.A.P. for holding one of the world’s
shortest campaigning periods — nine days — and for gerrymandering by
redrawing election boundaries in districts where they had made gains in the
previous poll. The P.A.P. rejected the assertions, saying that the electoral
boundaries review committee operates independently of the government.
In February, Mr. Singh was found guilty of lying under oath to Parliament, but
voters shrugged it off. In a survey conducted by Blackbox Research in the weeks
before the election, Mr. Singh had an approval rating of 71 percent, up seven points
from the previous quarter. Mr. Wong was a touch ahead, with 75 percent.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/asia/singapore-election-pap-

Euan Ward;Aaron Boxerman;Hwaida Saad;Vivian Yee,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,"Sectarian Clashes Spread Around Syria’s Capital, Drawing In Israel","Israel launched airstrikes on Syria on Wednesday and threatened to strike
government forces there if clashes persisted between pro-government fighters and
militiamen from the Druse minority.
Wading into the latest eruption of sectarian violence in the country, the Israeli
military said its aircraft had struck a group of “operatives” accused of having
“attacked Druse civilians” in spreading violence around the outskirts of the capital,
Damascus. The Syrian governor of the area, Amr al-Sheikh, said in a news
conference on Wednesday night that the airstrike had killed one member of the
Syrian government’s general security forces and one civilian.
The Israeli military did not identify the “operatives,” but forces aligned with the
Islamist government have been locked in fierce clashes in the area with Druse
militiamen for two days. Earlier, the Israeli government said its forces had targeted
members of an unidentified “extremist group” south of Damascus.
Israel is home to a substantial Druse community, many of whom see themselves as
loyal citizens and serve in the military.
Israel Strikes in Syria, Intervening in Sectarian
Violence
At least 39 people — including 22 on Wednesday — have been killed in two days of
clashes between Syrians on the outskirts of Damascus, according to the Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights, a war-monitoring group based in Britain.
The Israeli airstrikes on Wednesday came after violent clashes broke out around
the town of Ashrafieh Sahnaya, a largely Druse area south of Damascus.
The attacks on areas around Damascus with large Druse populations began
overnight Monday into Tuesday after an audio clip circulated on social media
purporting to be a Druse cleric insulting the Prophet Muhammad. The cleric
denied the accusation, and Syria’s Interior Ministry said that its initial findings
showed that he was not the person in the clip.
The violence is stoking fears among Syria’s diverse ethnic and religious minorities
who have grown increasingly worried about persecution under the rule of Syria’s
new Islamist leaders, who overthrew the dictator Bashar al-Assad in December.
The latest wave of sectarian violence began in the predominantly Druse city of
Jaramana. By the end of Tuesday, 17 people had been killed.
The unrest spread into Wednesday to Ashrafieh Sahnaya, where Druse militia
fighters battled “forces affiliated to the ministries of defense and interior and other
proxy forces” of the government, according to the war monitoring group.
Mr. al-Sheikh, the area’s governor, said in the news conference that members of
“outlaw groups” had attacked checkpoints staffed by government security forces in
Jaramana on Tuesday and in Ashrafieh Sahnaya on Wednesday, prompting the
government to cordon off both cities to protect them.
He said that 14 were killed in total on both sides Monday. Clashes then erupted
twice in Ashrafieh Sahnaya on Wednesday between government forces and the
outlaws, he said, killing 11 government forces.
Mr. al-Sheikh did not identify the “outlaw groups.” But in an apparent reference to
Druse militias who appear linked to Wednesday’s clashes, he repeated three times
that “weapons should be in the state’s hands.”
Syria’s new leaders have struggled to integrate the complex web of armed groups
operating across the country into the new state apparatus. Several of the strongest
Druse militias are in talks with the government about their conditions for
integrating into the army.
Abu Hassan, a Druse militia commander in the southern Syrian city of Sweida who
goes by a nom de guerre, painted a more sinister picture of the government forces
Mr. al-Sheikh had said had been involved, saying foreign fighters and other
extremist militants nominally affiliated with the government had been involved in
the attacks on Druse areas. Abu Hassan also suggested that the audio clip had been
a faked pretext for the violence, saying this was really about settling old scores in
the aftermath of Syria’s nearly 14-year civil war.
The state news agency, SANA, said armed gunmen — an apparent reference to the
Druse fighters — had attacked checkpoints and vehicles overnight on Wednesday
belonging to government forces in Ashrafieh Sahnaya.
An Interior Ministry official called the gunmen who attacked government forces
“criminals” and vowed that the government would strike back “with an iron fist,”
according to SANA.
Israel’s first airstrike on Wednesday was described as a warning against “an
extremist group” said to be preparing to attack Druse, according to a joint
statement by the Israeli prime minister’s office and the defense minister.
Israel has offered to protect the Druse in Syria should they come under attack amid
the tumultuous transition of power in the country. Many Syrian Druse have
rejected that offer, however, denouncing what they consider potentially destructive
foreign meddling.
Syria is a predominantly Sunni Muslim nation, while the Druse are a religious
group that practices a secretive religion rooted in Islam.
The rebels who ousted Mr. al-Assad were led by a Sunni Islamist group once linked
to Al Qaeda. They now run the government and the national military.
Since Mr. al-Assad was ousted, Israel has carried out numerous incursions in Syria,
raiding villages, launching hundreds of airstrikes and destroying military outposts.
Israel says that it wants to prevent weapons from falling into the hands of hostile
groups and that it does not want enemy forces to entrench themselves close to its
borders.
Sectarian violence has hit Syria several times since the ouster of Mr. al-Assad,
stoking fears among many minority groups that the country’s new leaders will
marginalize or target them.
Last month, a wave of sectarian killings spread across Syria’s coastal region, home
of the country’s Alawites, the minority group that the Assad family belongs to.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/middleeast/syria-sectarian-fighting-druse.html
Roger Cohen,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,Macron Surprises a Provincial Bar,"“Bonjour, Macron!”
At Le Prem’s, a small bar in western France that sells lottery tickets and tobacco,
this greeting has become a running joke since President Emmanuel Macron
dropped by unannounced the other day and bought a round of coffee for everyone,
save the customers who opted for a bracing midmorning sauvignon blanc.
“He did not come to scratch!” said Christophe Jacques, the cheerful bar owner,
alluding to the betting games he offers on scratch cards, where winning numbers
are revealed by scratching off an opaque covering. “He came to chat.”
Chat the president did, for more than an hour, about health care and jobs and
salaries and other day-to-day concerns of an anxious French people. Perched on a
bar stool against a backdrop of cigarette packets warning, “SMOKING

DIMINISHES FERTILITY,” he seemed happy to shoot the breeze. It was a break
for Mr. Macron from building Europe into a credible military power, now that the
United States often seems less friend than foe.
Some regulars — and the bar has many, especially among retirees — were so
shocked that they initially thought he was a Macron doppelgänger.
A farmer, Jean-Claude Turpault, 60, right, has coffee as part of his morning ritual at Le Prem’s, which

“I was studying the form for a horseracing bet, turned around and was face to face
with Macron!” said Jean-Claude Turpault, a farmer. “Could not believe it. I’d
imagined him more arrogant, but he was easy to talk to.”
A screen showed horse races. Newspapers hung from a rack, looking like relics. A
scratch card game called “Carats” did a brisk business. Black-and-white postcards
were on sale. Mr. Macron drank two espressos without sugar at the zinc bar, where
people lingered. They were not in a hurry; there was nothing to hurry to. Le Prem’s
felt like the France of the movies, where romance is kindled in faded bars, minus
the smoke.
Since taking office eight years ago, Mr. Macron has struggled to overcome an
image of lofty remoteness, which has earned him the sobriquet “Jupiter.” He has
tried, but to little avail, various remedies, including a three-month listening and
talking tour of the provinces after the Yellow Vest protests, sparked by a fuel price
hike, erupted in 2018.
Now, dispensing with the press, with cameras, with his entourage and with any
advance warning, Mr. Macron has taken to dropping in solo on random bars,
mainly so-called “PMU bar-tabacs,” the only places in France licensed to sell
tobacco and handle betting. They are distinguished by the orange diamond-like
symbol on their facades, colloquially known as “the carrot.”
These outlets for gambling on horses and much else, while having a drink and
enjoying what’s left of community camaraderie, are often among the few
commercial survivors in villages and small towns across France. Countless
bakeries, cafes, post offices, train stations, banks and Mom-and-Pop stores have
closed as online retail, big-box hypermarkets and pressure on municipal budgets
have taken a toll.

Thouars, a town of 14,000 inhabitants with a pretty setting on the Thouet river, is no
exception.
The once bustling Rue St.-Médard at its center is now a procession of shuttered
stores. Alexandre Fleveau, a hotel owner, described the main square as “an airport
parking lot” before the centrist mayor, Bernard Paineau, embarked on a bid to
“vegetalize” it with tree plantings and other improvements that, for now, have
turned it into a construction site. A new cultural center, offering movies and
exhibitions, will open soon.
“I pay taxes for all the people here doing nothing, and there are a lot of them,” said
Mr. Jacques, the bar owner. He is looking to sell the bar and move to the Camargue
region in southern France.
Mr. Macron, with two years left in his presidency, wants to get close, at last, to the
French people, who sometimes call him “extraterrestrial” for his technocratic and
intellectual bent. The two French presidents most fondly remembered in recent
decades are François Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac, because they demonstrated a
bond with the people — and the cattle — of France. The incumbent is aware of this.
Christophe Jacques, an owner of Le Prem’s. “I pay taxes for all the people here doing nothing, and there

“He’s looking for more proximity, simplicity, away from the cameras and media
pools that make sincerity impossible,” said a close adviser to Mr. Macron who
requested the anonymity under which officials at the presidency customarily
speak. “People are worried by Putin, by Trump, by the cost of living, and he has a
unique ability to reassure.”
For Mr. Macron’s critics, and there are many, this is no more than “authenticity in
kit form,” as the right-wing JDD Sunday newspaper put it recently.
Still, the Macron who pops in at Le Prem’s feels different, a man who gives shorter
speeches, projects authority in a crisis and devotes greater attention to the
“périphérie,” roughly, the flyover country, where a sense of abandonment has led
voters to reject mainstream parties. Viewed as a lame duck last year after a
succession of blunders, including an abrupt dissolution of Parliament that led to
chaos, Mr. Macron has reacquired a raison d’être.
Two recent polls, for the newspapers Le Figaro and JDD, showed Mr. Macron’s
popularity surging four percentage points, to nearly 30 percent, a respectable
showing in a country of strong egalitarian spirit, where scathing attacks on the
president are a national pastime and single-digit approval ratings are not
unknown.
Although he is term-limited and toward the end of his presidency, Mr. Macron has
assumed a more important role since President Trump took office because he is
widely seen in France and beyond as one of the most experienced orchestrators of
an effective European response to the new American distance from, and contempt
for, the continent. Mr. Macron’s quest for more contact, as in Thouars, forms part of
his push for a rebirth.
The once bustling Rue St.-Médard in the center of Thouars is now a procession of shuttered stores. Dmitry

“You know a barman has to be a psychologist, a confidant,” said Nicolas Cossard,
who works at Le Prem’s. “You listen to people newly widowed, to old people talking
about their gardens, their billiards, their Bingo, their car. Macron has been absent
for me. But when I shook his hand, my sense was he was not just trying to gain
credit.”
Alain Duhamel, the author of a book about Mr. Macron, said that the French
president had adjusted his style, if not his essence, to appear as “the sober rather
than the theatrical seducer.”
In Thouars, Mayor Paineau, who is also a successful entrepreneur, was alerted to
Mr. Macron’s visit when the president was already at the bar, so he rushed over,
delaying his appearance at a lunch for older people. On leaving Le Prem’s, Mr.
Macron insisted on accompanying the mayor to apologize for the delay. He stayed
through the meal.
“The band struck up the Marseillaise at the end, everyone rose, it was a moving
moment,” the mayor said. “He did not have to do that.”
Mr. Macron went on to visit Asselin, a local company that has provided beams for
the reconstruction of Notre-Dame Cathedral. Thouars is struggling but not
moribund.
At the bar, life goes on, albeit a little changed. An espresso is now known as a “petit
Macron.”
Mr. Jacques, warming to his role, said, “We are awaiting Putin next week.”

Lawyers for those deported say the March 15 operation circumvented due process
and swept up those who are not gang members. The Supreme Court is now poised
to weigh in on how the White House has sought to apply the Alien Enemies Act,
which had previously only been invoked by presidents in time of war.
A team of reporters from The New York Times reviewed court filings and
government documents and interviewed government officials and lawyers for
deportees and their relatives to reconstruct how the United States secured the deal
with El Salvador and seized on the law to supercharge its deportation efforts.
Here are five takeaways.’
5 Takeaways from The Times’s Examination of
the Salvadoran Prison Deal
El Salvador’s president pressed the U.S. for assurances that the
deportees had gang ties.
President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has championed President Trump and his
immigration agenda and publicly celebrated the arrival of the deportees from the
United States. But behind the scenes, Mr. Bukele expressed concern about whom
the United States sent to be imprisoned in his new Terrorism Confinement Center,
known as CECOT, according to according to people familiar with the situation and
documents obtained by The New York Times.
During the negotiations, Mr. Bukele told U.S. officials he would take only what he
described as “convicted criminals” from other countries. He made it clear that he
did not want migrants from other nations whose only crime was being in the
United States illegally.
Almost immediately after the deportations, a senior U.S. official told colleagues
that Mr. Bukele wanted evidence that all 238 Venezuelans sent to El Salvador were
members of Tren de Aragua, a transnational gang with roots in Venezuela, as the
Trump administration had promised.
U.S. officials rushed to provide Mr. Bukele with information they had compiled,
which included a scorecard in which each man was designated a gang member
based on points for certain affiliations and activities, such as having a range of
tattoos.
The scramble underscored the haphazard nature of the deportation operation and
deepened questions about whether the Trump administration sufficiently assessed
whom it sent to a prison designed for terrorists.
President Bukele sought specific MS-13 gang leaders as part of the
deal.
In return for opening the doors of his prison to Mr. Trump, Mr. Bukele had a
specific request: a list of Salvadoran MS-13 leaders he wanted released from U.S.
custody and sent back home, where he said they could be interrogated by his
security officers.
That request worried some law enforcement officials. In recent years, the Treasury
Department and Justice Department have accused Mr. Bukele’s government of
making a secret pact with MS-13, offering its leaders behind bars special privileges
to keep homicides down in El Salvador. Mr. Bukele has denied the claims.
Nevertheless, U.S. officials agreed to send El Salvador around a dozen senior
members of MS-13, including César Humberto López-Larios, who had been in U.S.
custody awaiting trial on narco-terrorism conspiracy charges. Mr. Bukele has so
far not received everyone he sought, but U.S. officials say they still intend to send
more of the gang leaders he requested.
Early on, Trump aides identified the Alien Enemies Act as a way
to speed deportations.
The Alien Enemies Act was passed in 1798, allowing the U.S. government to swiftly
deport citizens of an invading nation. The authority has been invoked just three
times in the past, all during times of war.
Long before he took office a second time, advisers to Mr. Trump identified the law
as a potentially powerful weapon to harness for immigration enforcement. The
reason: It gave the government the power to summarily expel people, without
normal due process.
The law “allows you to instantaneously remove any noncitizen foreigner from an
invading country, aged 14 or older,” Stephen Miller, now a top White House aide,
told the right-wing podcaster Charlie Kirk in a September 2023 interview, adding:
“That allows you to suspend the due process that normally applies to a removal
proceeding.”fi
The White House had confidence in its odds at the Supreme
Court.
On the day of the operation, the American Civil Liberties Union rushed to court to
try to halt the administration’s use of the wartime act to deport Venezuelan
migrants. Judge James E. Boasberg temporarily blocked the use of the law and
ordered any planes in the air to turn around.
At the time, two of the flights with deportees were in the air, en route to El
Salvador. A third plane had not yet taken off.
Inside the White House, senior administration officials quickly discussed the order
and whether they should move ahead. The team of Trump advisers decided to go
forward, believing the planes were safely in international airspace, and well aware
that the legal fight was most likely destined for the Supreme Court, where
conservatives have a majority.
Shortly afterward, the third flight took off. Officials would later say the migrants on
that flight were not deported under the Alien Enemies Act, but through regular
immigration proceedings.
The U.S. has paid El Salvador millions to imprison the deportees.
The White House initially said the United States paid El Salvador $6 million to jail
the Venezuelan deportees. Officials now say the payment amounted to less than $5
million.
Democratic lawmakers have sought more information, with little success. On
March 17, the State Department told the Senate Appropriations Committee that
sum could grow to $15 million, but refused to provide any additional details.",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/trump-el-salvador-prison-deal-takeaways.html
José Bautista;Jenny Gross;John Yoon,NYT,1,World,4/30/2025,Spain Searches for Answers on What Caused Power Blackout,"Two days after one of Europe’s worst blackouts in decades plunged tens of millions
of people across Spain and Portugal into darkness for up to 18 hours, officials from
both countries emerged from hourslong meetings and gave little indication publicly
that they were any closer to determining the cause.
“We are collecting thousands of data points from the energy system to shed light
on what happened,” Sara Aagesen, one of Spain’s vice presidents, said at a news
conference on Wednesday after Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain held two
meetings with senior officials in Madrid. She added, “We don’t know the cause,
which is why the investigation is essential.”
Neither the Spanish nor Portuguese government has publicly speculated on the
cause of the blackout, which began on Monday afternoon, leaving hospitals running
on generators, trains halted and supermarkets shut. Electricity was fully restored
by Tuesday morning. Parts of France were also briefly affected.
On Wednesday morning, Mr. Sánchez met with National Security Council officials
and then with the Council of Ministers at Moncloa Palace, the prime minister’s
residence in Madrid, to discuss the outage.
Spain and Portugal Look for Cause of
Widespread Blackout
Pilar Alegría, a spokeswoman for the Spanish government, said at the news
conference that Mr. Sánchez had set up a new committee to determine the cause
and ensure that a blackout would not happen again. Portuguese officials also said
the cause was still unknown.
The incident has raised questions about whether Spain and Portugal’s rapid shift to
renewable energy left them more vulnerable to outages. Ms. Aagesen, the vice
president, who is also the minister overseeing Spain’s ecological transition, on
Wednesday denied that the power outage had any connection to Spain’s rapid
expansion in renewable energy.
The Spanish government has not ruled out a cyberattack on the transmission grid,
even though Red Eléctrica, Spain’s grid operator, said there was no evidence of one.
A judge on Tuesday ordered Red Eléctrica, the intelligence service and the police to
produce reports within 10 days about whether a cyberattack was behind the power
outage, according to a court document. The National Cryptologic Center, which
oversees cyberthreats, was also reviewing Red Eléctrica’s online systems to
“ensure no hypothesis is ruled out,” Mr. Sánchez said.
There have been relatively few instances of disruption to electrical systems
because of cyberattacks; these issues are more commonly caused by equipment
failures, operational errors and effects of storms, according to the International
Energy Agency in Paris.
Hannah Christensen, a physics professor at the University of Oxford, said a stable
supply of electricity depends on equal amounts of energy flowing in and out of the
grid. It can be harder to balance flows in a system that depends on renewable
sources, she said.
If there is an imbalance, automatic mechanisms will take companies offline as a
precaution. “In the worst case scenario, you get these kind of cascading effects of
user after user disconnecting, and then the supply is massively larger than the
demand,” she said, adding that this could lead to blackouts.
After power was restored, Spain’s Interior Ministry on Tuesday downgraded many
regions from the highest of three alert levels to a medium one. Madrid and the
western region of Extremadura remained at the highest level on Wednesday, the
ministry said, because of disagreements between local and federal officials.
In Portugal, Prime Minister Luís Montenegro said after an emergency government
meeting on Tuesday that the outage was related to an abrupt increase in voltage in
the Spanish electricity grid, which activated safety mechanisms that led to the
blackout.
“We will calmly assess with the Spanish authorities what happened and try to
design better response instruments in the future to avoid a repeat of this
occurrence,” he said.
The outage is expected to be a key topic during a debate on Wednesday between
Mr. Montenegro and the opposition leader, Pedro Nuno Santos, ahead of a
parliamentary election on May 18. The two had originally been scheduled to debate
on Monday.","https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/europe/power-outage-spain-

Motoko Rich,NYT,1,World,5/3/2025,These Contentious Issues Could Determine Who Becomes the Next Pope,"The cardinals who have traveled to Rome to elect the next pope at a conclave next
week sometimes look as ideologically polarized as many secular voters around the
globe.
At first glance, they appear to split along the kinds of left-right lines that
characterize political contests elsewhere. Many conservative Roman Catholic
Church leaders disagreed with Pope Francis, who was often a darling of liberals
around the world.
But the typical divisions between progressives and conservatives don’t correspond
so neatly with the ideological battles within the Vatican and the broader church.
Although there are some exceptions among the cardinals, the issue that most
consistently marked Francis as a liberal — his fierce advocacy on behalf of
migrants and the poor — does not necessarily set him apart, because the Catholic
Church has made the gospel’s call to shelter and feed strangers a fundamental
tenet.
Ultimately, the cardinals’ choice will amount to a referendum on whether to extend
Francis’ legacy of inclusivity and openness to change. That was “how he made
sense of living in a highly polarized age,” said Anna Rowlands, a political theologian
at Durham University in England.
Francis understood “what’s at stake in the polarization,” said Professor Rowlands,
and was willing to accept disagreement as a precursor to dialogue. “The danger is
the church moves into a moment when it might be tempted to choose a pole,” she
said, which could close off discussion altogether.
More than any single issue, the choice of the next pontiff will be dominated by a
philosophical question: Who deserves a say in determining the Catholic Church’s
future?
Decision-Making
Francis often argued that regular practicing Catholics — including women and
L.G.B.T.Q. people — should be consulted about the direction of the church. He
invited lay people to sit with bishops to discuss controversial issues in Vatican
meetings called synods.
He was opposed by more conservative leaders, who may be keen to return to
centralized decision making. “I think the conversation will have to go along the
lines of, ‘Can we get away with doing away with it?’” said Miriam Duignan, the
executive director of the Wijngaards Institute for Catholic Research in Cambridge,
England.
Another key split is between those who believe the church should welcome
everyone — including those whose lives don’t match traditional church teachings
— and those who think that only those committed to unwavering Catholic doctrine
should be admitted into the church’s fold.
“It’s that big-tent vision of the church that is sometimes the source of tension and
apprehension,” said Rev. Agbonkhianmeghe E. Orobator, dean of the Jesuit School
of Theology at Santa Clara University. “It’s very different when you think of church
as a perfect society or closed society where membership is defined by doctrinal
allegiance or orthodoxy.”

Women in the Church
Two years ago, Francis for the first time allowed women to vote at a significant
meeting of bishops. Last year, he punted on a decision about whether women could
be ordained as deacons who can preach and preside over weddings, funerals and
baptisms.
Francis was clear that he wanted women to be permitted more options than “altar
girls or the president of a charity,” but resisted the notion that they needed to
participate in the church hierarchy. In many places with priest shortages, women
increasingly do the work of ministering to congregants.
Conservatives say that allowing women to be deacons would create a pathway for
them eventually to become priests. They argue that doing so would violate 2,000
years of church doctrine, despite what some experts say is historical evidence that
women acted as deacons in the early church.
Even if the ordination of women remains contentious among the cardinals, it would
be difficult to stifle the debate altogether because of pressure from female Catholic
activists.
Cardinal Tarcisio Isao Kikuchi, the archbishop of Tokyo, said in an interview last
month that he saw “nothing wrong with ordaining women as deacons.” But he said,
“there are still many problems that need to be overcome.”
Married Priests
The church has a dearth of priests in many countries. In 2019, a summit of Roman
Catholic bishops recommended that Francis allow married men to serve as priests
in the remote Amazon region, where the shortage is particularly acute.
A year later, Francis said he needed more time to consider the landmark proposal,
deciding that the church wasn’t yet ready to lift its roughly 1,000-year-old
restriction requiring priests to be single, celibate men. Many of his supporters who
expected him to be a pope of radical change felt let down.
Divorce
On the question of divorced and remarried Catholics, Francis urged priests not to
treat them like pariahs, and to welcome them with “doors wide open.”
Francis opened up the debate over whether to allow divorced and remarried
Catholics to receive communion even if they had not had their previous marriages
annulled by a church tribunal. But in the end, he backed off from any change in
church law and simply encouraged priests to be welcoming to divorced and
remarried Catholics.
“People who started a new union after the defeat of their sacramental marriage are
not at all excommunicated, and they absolutely must not be treated that way,”
Francis said. “Though their unions are contrary to the sacrament of marriage, the
church, as a mother, seeks the good and salvation of all her children.”
Sexual Orientation
Pope Francis ushered in a new era for L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics when in 2023 he
permitted priests to bless same-sex couples. He made clear that marriage was
reserved for relationships between a woman and a man, but his changes still
stoked the ire of conservatives, especially in Africa and North America.
In countries in Africa and other regions where homosexuality is a crime, Francis
explicitly condemned the criminalization but allowed bishops in Africa to forbid
priests to bless same-sex couples because of the danger to them if they were outed.
In cultures that stigmatized gay relationships, clergy would be given an “extended
period of pastoral reflection” to accept the new path that Francis always argued did
not contradict church teachings.

Sexual Abuse
Some among the church hierarchy might like to declare the crisis of sexual abuse
by Catholic priests over. But abuse survivors and activists warn that practices and
the mentality in local parishes have not changed enough to prevent future cases or
address the pain of existing ones.
A statement from the Vatican press office on Friday said the cardinals were
discussing sexual abuse in the church as a “‘wound’ to be kept ‘open’, so that
awareness of the problem remains alive and concrete paths for its healing can be
identified.”
The biggest revelations have been concentrated in the United States, Australia and
Europe. But in most of Asia, Africa and Latin America, “a lot has yet to come out, so
this will continue to rumble on,” said Miles Pattenden, a historian who studies the
Catholic Church at Oxford University.
The Global South
The biggest growth areas for the Catholic Church are in Africa and Asia. The
cardinals selecting the next pope are surely discussing whether to choose someone
from one of those regions. Whoever they elect will need to reckon with the
proliferation of cultures and traditions, as well as spiritual heritages, among new
followers. Some may come with different expectations of what role the faith plays
in their lives and how they should accommodate its rules.
Whether or not the new pope comes from those regions, he “must be one who is
ready to speak to the injustices that exist in relationship between the global north
and the global south in international politics,” said Nora Kofognotera Nonterah, a
theological ethicist at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in
Ghana. “A pope cannot run away from that in the 21st century.”
As the church recruits new followers, it will also need to find a way to speak to its
youngest members. “Young people are no longer interested in taking directives
and working with directives,” Dr. Nonterah said. “They want to ask questions and
they want to be asked questions.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/world/europe/pope-conclave-contentious-issues.html

Updated April 21, 2025
When Thierno Agne was a student casting about for a lucrative career, he told his
agriculture professor he was considering growing strawberries in Senegal.
“You will fail,” he remembered the professor warning.
He didn’t listen, and now, at 36, Mr. Agne runs one of the biggest strawberry farms
in the country.
He had not even wanted to be a farmer. He had started his higher education by
studying law. But then, he shocked his family by switching to agriculture when he
realized there were already more law graduates in Senegal than there were jobs
available.

Still, despite the glut of legal graduates, his shift in focus was an unusual move for
an ambitious young man in a country where farming is seen as a job for old,
uneducated or poor people.
Mr. Agne has shown, however, that farming can be a profession that requires
education, commands as much respect and remuneration as a lawyer, and
demands as much innovation as any high-tech entrepreneur is expected to show.
On a recent morning at his farm just outside Dakar, the capital, Mr. Agne quietly
trod the rows of vibrant strawberry plants, checking how his delicate crop was
doing.
This crop would be sold in Dakar supermarkets and by roadside vendors — part of
Mr. Agne’s mission to turn what was recently a luxury treat into an everyday fruit.
A strawberry-growing plot of land at FraiSen — the name of Mr. Agne’s company, which is short for
Fraise Sénégalaise, or Senegalese Strawberry.

“We want to demystify the idea that strawberries are not for Africans,” Mr. Agne
said on his farm. “That they can be grown here, sold here, and locals, especially our
kids, should enjoy them.”
His mission just got harder. Until recently, he received support from the U.S.
Agency for International Development to hire seasonal staff and train people to
expand strawberry production in Senegal. That assistance was terminated in
February as part of the Trump administration’s gutting of the aid agency.
But students are still coming to the farm in Bayakh, a village in the Thiès region.
Strawberries are the favorite fruit of Rama Diane, 16, a student from Dakar who
recently visited one of Mr. Agne’s farms. But she hadn’t eaten one in a whole year.
Standing on the edge of a field full of them, she and her classmates were eager for a
taste. Ms. Diane popped one in her mouth and immediately started making
comparisons to the one she had last year.
“It wasn’t as sweet,” she said of last year’s berry. “I guess it was imported.”
The unique taste of his locally grown strawberries is a point of pride for Mr. Agne.
He is hoping to ultimately end strawberry imports, which currently account for
about 80 percent of Senegal’s consumption. But he is also determined to
demonstrate that farming can be a source of good jobs in a country where they’re
acutely scarce — 20 percent of young people are unemployed in Senegal.

which currently account for about 80 percent of Senegal’s consumption.

thanks to domestic crops, they are still a luxury for many.
Farming can also keep young people at home, he said, instead of pouring out of the
country by the thousands every year, often risking dangerous routes for
opportunities in Europe and the United States.
U.S.A.I.D. had been helping with goals like these.
In Senegal, where the agency spent $27 million last year, the dismantling of such
support will make young people feel hopeless and will fuel illegal migration,
according to Mr. Agne.
Several young people he mentored had been considering migrating to the United
States through a circuitous route via Nicaragua, but he managed to change their
minds. A big part of his pitch was the success that he had managed to find in
Senegal — and that he had a valid American visa but was too busy and satisfied at
home to want to cross the Atlantic with it.
Mr. Agne grew up outdoors and around agriculture, tending — and often singing to
— his father’s mango trees. But he never thought his future would be in fruit
production.
“It was fun,” he said, smiling as he reminisced about his emotional bond with his
father’s banana and mango plants.
But he saw his career path far from the fields of his hometown, Tambacounda. He
wanted to be a lawyer and follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, a respected
imam and colonial-era Muslim jurist.
Mr. Agne’s beloved grandfather was not only a Muslim jurist, but also a big-time farmer, who supplied
millet and corn to the French forces during World War II.
Before Mr. Agne started FraiSen, the production of strawberries on a commercial scale was unheard-of in
Senegal.
After completing his secondary-level education, he hopped a train to Dakar, which
he knew of only by the tales of its beauty, vibrant life and allure of opportunities.
“It was my first time ever leaving Tambacounda,” he said. “I got lost, and I didn’t
have enough money.”
A few days later, Mr. Agne showed up at Cheikh Anta Diop University and enrolled
in a law program.
But when one of his professors told him that more than 2,000 recent graduates
from the law school still did not have jobs, he was bitterly disappointed.
Dejected, he went back to his hometown, worrying about his prospects. But on that
trip home, he learned for the first time that his beloved grandfather had been not
only a jurist, but also a major farmer who supplied millet and corn to French forces
during World War II, earning medals and French citizenship.
Upon returning to Dakar, he abandoned his law program and signed up to study
agriculture.
The decision divided his family. “Some thought I was mad,” he said.
On a recent morning, Mr. Agne welcomed over 60 students from a Senegalese
school, and as he explained the science he had applied to grow strawberries
against the odds, the biology teacher who brought the students started nodding
along.
The teacher, Alieu Bah, said his students picture farming as something the poor do.
“I want them to change that perception,” he said.

Mr. Agne explaining how to pick the berry to the visiting high school students.
It was harvest season, and such organized visits to Mr. Agne’s farms were frequent.
With the earth softened by recent watering, the delighted students ran wild
through the fields, picking ripe strawberries.
“I am so, so excited to be here,” Rama said, adding that it was her first visit to a
farm, and even more thrilling, it was a strawberry farm.
Before Mr. Agne started FraiSen — the name of his company, which is short for
Fraise Sénégalaise, or Senegalese Strawberry — the berry’s production on a
commercial scale was unheard-of in Senegal. The West African country’s hot and
humid climate and erratic rains were simply not suitable for it, many thought.
Mr. Agne himself was 22 when he first saw strawberries, on a school exchange in
France.
Until then, the main crop he had seen was peanuts, Senegal’s primary export crop,
and millet, a grain grown for local consumption.
So what drove him to embrace such an unexpected crop?
“It’s sexy,” he said, as he moved in between rows of the berry on his sun-drenched
farm. “It’s different.”
He began his experiment by planting a few strawberries on his balcony in Dakar,
and they thrived. He then rented a 2,150-square-foot plot for $250 to begin
commercial operations. He earned nearly $6,000 with his first crop in 2015.
His second year, after scaling up to a little over 5,000 square feet, he profited
around $13,000. That gave him the confidence to expand further, to 2.5 acres. But
then his plants spoiled midway through the growing season.
Mr. Agne, left, preparing trays of strawberries for distribution.
The unique taste of his locally grown strawberries is a point of pride for Mr. Agne.
“I guess I was overambitious,” he admitted. “Now, I take things step by step.”
Eight years after that hard lesson, Mr. Agne now cultivates a total of 12 acres on
three fields, producing 50 tons of strawberries annually. His plan is to acquire a 50-
acre field next year, which would put him into a small circle of large-scale
agricultural producers in Senegal, where 95 percent of farms are small, mostly
subsistence holdings.
He has trained hundreds of young people over the years, some of whom have
become strawberry farmers, and others who process the strawberries into juice.
“There are now 50 of us,” he said, referring to an association of strawberry farmers
he created. “Together, we produce 180 tons every year.”
With this homegrown production, strawberries are now cheaper in Senegal’s
groceries and even sold by hawkers on the streets. But at $9 to $11 per kilogram (a
little over two pounds), they’re still unaffordable for many.
As the visiting students left, each holding a box of strawberries, Mr. Agne inspected
his plants, which miraculously survived the stomping.
“I am proud of what I have achieved,” he said. “I have put my country on the map
of strawberry producers.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/world/africa/senegal-strawberry-farmer-profile.html
Farnaz Fassihi,NYT,1,World,4/29/2025,"U.N. Orders Agencies to Find Budget Cuts, Including via Staff Moves From N.Y.","The United Nations, anticipating that President Trump will slash U.S. contributions
to the global body, has told its departments to draw up plans for budget cuts,
including through staff relocations from New York and Geneva to less-expensive
cities.
The instructions — outlined in a two-page memo dated April 25 that was reviewed
by The New York Times — were sent from Secretary General António Guterres’s
office to the heads of all agencies that report directly to him. The memo set a May
15 deadline for all proposals so that they could be added to the 2026 budget.
“Your objective is to identify as many functions as possible that could be relocated
to existing lower-cost locations,” the memo reads, “or otherwise reduced or
abolished if they are duplicative or no longer viable.”
U.N. Orders Agencies to Find Budget Cuts,
Including via Staff Relocations From N.Y.

In February, President Trump signed an executive order calling for a review of the
overall U.S. funding and ties to the U.N. He withdrew the United States from
several U.N. organizations, including those dealing with human rights, women’s
reproductive rights, climate change, Palestinian aid and global health. In his first
term, he also reduced U.S. contributions to peacekeeping efforts.
Three senior U.N. officials said on Tuesday that the drastic, cost-cutting measures
laid out in the memo had caught the agency’s departments by surprise and went
beyond what they had expected. The officials, who requested anonymity because
they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the directive was largely viewed as
a way for the U.N. to brace for potential additional cuts by Mr. Trump and to
proactively insulate it from the financial blow.
But the U.N. officials said the budget cuts were ordered only partly in response to
Mr. Trump’s moves. The directive comes as the U.N. is adjusting to a host of
financial problems, they said, from the withdrawal and reduction in financial
contributions by major donors like the United States and Europe to a cash-flow
crisis caused by member states’ not paying their annual dues on time and in full.
Mr. Guterres announced on March 12 that he was launching an initiative called
UN80 — named for the organization’s 80th anniversary — to create cost-effective
measures and improve efficiency across the organization.
“These are times of intense uncertainty and unpredictability,” Mr. Guterres said at
the time. “Resources are shrinking across the board — and they have been for a
long time.”
He also said that a reduction in funding from the United States and other countries
had “naturally led to the need by the agencies that deliver those services to reduce
staff, to shrink their dimension and to eliminate many activities.”
Stéphane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, said the April 25 memo had resulted from
the UN80 initiative.
Richard Gowan, the U.N. director for the International Crisis Group, said that while
the U.N. was portraying the moves as an internal overhaul, in reality, they had
resulted from pressure by and anxiety about the Trump administration.
“The U.S. cuts, the range of the cuts and scale of the cuts have really shocked the
U.N.,” Mr. Gowan said in an interview. “So Guterres is now frankly racing to catch
up with a very bad situation.”
The United States is the largest contributor to the U.N., accounting for nearly 25
percent of its overall budget, which in 2024 amounted to about $3.6 billion and went
toward administrative and peacekeeping needs. America is also a major donor to
various U.N. agencies for humanitarian relief work; in 2022, the United States
contributed about $18 billion to the U.N. across the board.
Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden also have announced deep cuts in
international aid, including to the U.N., in order to focus on domestic needs and
defense priorities. China, a major contributor to the U.N., has traditionally stepped
up funding toward programs that align with its own interests, like peacekeeping.
Now, the U.N. estimates it would face a 20 percent budget reduction for 2026 as a
result of funding cuts, according to Mr. Gowan, which would amount to billions of
dollars in losses.
Some agencies, including UNICEF and the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs, said they had already begun cost-cutting reviews separate
from the Guterres directive.
A senior official at UNICEF said the agency was anticipating at least a 20 percent
budget decrease for 2026. UNICEF is also considering relocating a sizable portion
of its staff to Valencia, Spain, from New York, the senior official said. The goal, he
added, was to ensure any budget shortfall would have as little effect as possible on
programs that serve children.
UNICEF is funded through donations from member states, the private sector and
individuals. It does not receive money from the U.N.’s overall budget.
Even before the memo was sent, Mr. Guterres said last month that the U.N.’s
Population Fund, which focuses on women’s health and reproductive rights, would
move its entire operation to Nairobi, Kenya, from New York.
